how should you address me? professor cranor and dr. cranor
  are both fine if this is a professional context where titles are
  used. outside of professional contexts you may use dr. cranor
  or ms. cranor. please do not address me as mrs. cranor in any
  context. if we're not using
  titles, then lorrie is just fine. if you can't decide whether
  to be formal or not, professor lorrie will also do. i use my
  full name lorrie faith cranor in my publications, but no need to
  include my middle name elsewhere.
   pronouns: she/her.

consulting

i have consulted for companies and non-profits on
privacy policies, p3p, usable privacy and security, and technology policy. i have also served as an
expert witness in patent litigation and in privacy cases, and in cases
 challenging the constitutionality of internet harmful-to-minors laws,
including the aclu's successful challenge to the 1998 children's online
protection act. i currently do expert witness consulting through
    harbor labs.
personal

i walk to work, play recreational soccer, practice yoga, take lots
      of photos, sew clothes with pockets, 
      and design and create quilts. i also
      play the bass flute in the city flutes flute choir, 
      serve as an allegheny county elections poll
      worker,  and organized the  dynamoms women's
      soccer club.

"i started quilting in grad school because i wanted to create
  something beautiful and see tangible progress when i got frustrated
  writing my dissertation. thirty years later, i continue to design
  and sew quilts and now also clothing. figuring out how to construct
  an idea i have in my mind out of fabric is a bit of an engineering
  challenge, but it is very different from what i do all day at
  work. i find it both relaxing and exciting, and i love the tactile
  nature of working with fabric. i enjoy designing and sewing clothing
  that meets all the requirements of the wearer: comfortable, perfect
  fit, looks great on, washable and of course it has to have
  functional pockets! and it is lots of fun when someone compliments
  me on my outfit, and i tell them i sewed it myself!" -- (cmu arts
