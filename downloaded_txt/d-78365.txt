why pursue a computer science degree?
computer science at the harvard school of engineering studies both the fundamentals of computation and computation’s interaction with the world. computer scientists develop new algorithms, invent new systems and theories that empower people and society, and advance the science of computing while working with engineers, scientists, social scientists, lawyers, artists, and others around the university and beyond.
computer scientists at harvard pursue work in a wide range of areas including theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, economics and computer science, privacy and security, data-management systems, intelligent interfaces, operating systems, computer graphics, computational linguistics, robotics, networks, architectures, programing languages, machine learning, and visualization.
students and researchers are involved in a number of interdisciplinary initiatives across the university, such as:

the kempner institute for the study of national and artificial intelligence
the center for research on computation and society
the data science initiative
the berkman klein center for internet & society.
