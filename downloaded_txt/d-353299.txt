ed gondolf 
							
"i send heaps of praise to bisc-mi for launching the conferences, networking, dialogue, and information that especially programs for men who batter their partners so desperately need to develop and maintain their work. they’ve done so in a manner that promotes discussion, clarification, broader understanding, and invigoration, amidst a time of debate, contention, and backlash. i especially appreciate their efforts to help address the misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the research on batterer programs that have confused much of the field and the public at large." 
							former research director
mid-atlantic addiction training institute 
							 


fernando mederos 
							
despite its obscure abbreviated name, bisc-mi shines a light on batterer intervention practice and provides a forum for discussing our work with thoughtful and helpfully opinionated peers.  it is the best current hope for renewing the field and defending its hard-won gains.  it is also an invaluable and deeply appreciated partnership of minds and hearts.  thank you.

rodney vlais 
							
"bisc-mi, with uk respect and the european work with perpetrators network, is one of the few international sources i go to for skill-sharing, colleagueship and news in domestic violence perpetrator work towards the safety, well-being and liberation of women and children from men's violence and coercive control. bisc-mi has opened up a world of innovation and evolution in our organisation's work in australia. rodney vlais, no to violence" 
							policy and practice coordinator

lisa nitsch 
							
"bisc-mi has received national attention because of their forward thinking and because they fill a much needed gap as a national clearinghouse for research and best practices. bisc-mi always looks at services from different angles and leaves space for opposing views. they have become an invaluable, thoughtful, inquisitive, creative and informative resource compiling information and ensuring that programs serve diverse families and communities."

mildred muhammad 
							
"bisc-mi has taken on a role that many people don't want to support...the counseling and healing of the batterer. it is difficult to assist the batterer in understanding and accepting what has been done to victims of domestic violence by their hands. bisc-mi helps to ensure that the safety of the victim or survivor is never compromised." 
							founder/executive director, after the trauma, inc. 
							 


michael paymar 
							
"i had the honor to present on the duluth model at the from roots to wings conference in 2005 and again at the advancing the narrative: inspiring the future! conference in 2015. the leadership of bisc-mi has helped all of us that do this important work to continue to engage in meaningful dialogue on effective ways of reducing and ending gender violence." 
							executive director, education for critical thinking 
							 


judge tom boyd 
							
"when i first became a judge i did not fully understand the dynamic in domestic violence cases. with the resources bisc-mi provided i learned to view domestic violence as an imbalance of power and control between intimate partners, rather than as an anger management issue. that perspective informs my decision-making, and i believe, leads to better outcomes for victims." 
							55th judicial district court 
							 


larry bennett 
							
"to my knowledge bisc-mi is the only organization to systematically and consistently support the work of batterer intervention staff and programs across the usa and canada and has an ongoing collection of documents where anyone in the world with a computer can find out about programs, state standards, state ipv coalitions, and trainings. bisc-mi has never lost sight of survivor-centered and safety perspectives." 
							professor, indiana university school of social work 
							 


lisa young larance 
							
"bisc-mi is an innovative force for changing the status quo. their leadership courageously sponsored the first national conference focused on contextually understanding the complexity of women's use of force: when she hits him: why gender & context matter. this set the standard for research and practice dissemination on this critical topic." 
							former renew program director
catholic social services of washtenaw county 
							 


alyce laviolette 
							
"bisc-mi has been an outstanding leader in this movement and does incredible outreach, including roots to wings, one of the best conferences i have ever attended. their work has been innovative and creative and reflects an openness and willingness to participate collaboratively with others." 
							founder-alternatives to violence 
							 


rhonda martinson 
							
"bisc-mi is the only place to go with all of the information about batterers' programs, intervention strategies and activities, and comparing national batterer certifications. bisc-mi values understanding qualitative information about recidivism, and provides a place to learn about batterer intervention program ideas that i often use in training the criminal justice system."

brant funkhouser 
							
"i am extremely grateful for the information provided at bisc-mi conferences for batterer intervention programs, offered to providers from diverse communities all over the state and country. these training opportunities have enlightened service providers and helped clients and their families experience miraculous, positive changes in their lives." 
							criminal defense attorney 
							 


larry bennett 
							
i want to wish bisc-mi a happy 20th birthday (2015). to my knowledge bisc-mi is the only organization to systematically and consistently support the work of batterer intervention staff and programs, not only in michigan but across the usa and canada. although and focused primarily on anti-violence work in michigan, bisc-mi has always brought a larger worldview to their organization and those of us from outside michigan have appreciated it. equally important, bisc-mi has never lost sight of the survivor-centered and safety perspectives that sometimes fall by the wayside. congratulations to bisc-mi for all they have done.

the bisc-mi board



if bip facilitators attend an internal training or peer supervision for part of the 20 hours of ongoing training that is required as a part of the michigan standards, participants must track the dates and hours of these trainings themselves and provide documentation of participation for each facilitator on the bipscc application.  for bisc-mi weekly peer supervision calls that occur on fridays, 2:00 pm-3:00 pm, est, participation is free and hours can be counted, and bisc-mi can confirm participation and count these hours as part of the internal trainings under these conditions: 1) when participants use their full name on the zoom screen while in the call;  2) if dates of attendance for these calls are noted in the bipscc application; and 3) calls are only counted when participant is on the call for the full time period.

note: refer to section 9.4, ongoing trainings, as part of the michigan state standards for more clarification.
