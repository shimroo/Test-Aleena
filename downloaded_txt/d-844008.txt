empowering women leaders

  the project kesher network has been at the forefront of investing in the humanitarian wartime needs of women and girls.
project kesher has invested in the development of more than 1,000 jewish women leaders in ukraine and israel and secular partners at every level of ukrainian and israeli society. in addition, project kesher serves as a thought leader convening trusted individuals and partner groups to set priorities, promote collaboration, communicate needs globally and fundraise inclusively with our partners.










   






            experienced in meeting grassroots needs
          










with more than 30 years of experience investing in ukraine and 15 years investing in russian and ukrainian-speaking immigrants in israel, project kesher knows first hand the needs of women and girls and then utilizes a carefully cultivated network of trained leaders, trusted partners, and effective strategies to meet those needs without duplication.








            gendered response to the war
          










whether it is delivering highly sought after items like generators, pumps, and food, or responding to the specific needs of women and girls with products such as menstrual cups, packages for mothers and newborns, and a telegram station for pregnant people and new mothers, project kesher ukraine has both a forward-looking vision and the ability to respond to crises. most recently, project kesher ukraine opened the women’s opportunity fund of ukraine to ensure that it could legally provide humanitarian care and fund business grants for small, women-owned businesses.project kesher israel is providing support to women and children from ukraine and russia who have sought refuge in israel. most of these immigrants and refugees do not speak hebrew and need assistance with safety protocols. in addition, many are living below the poverty level. pki’s priorities include food parcels for women, children, and the elderly, gift cards for warm clothes and hygiene products, first aid kits, and mental health support. 








            informed by jewish values with assistance to all
          










project kesher-funded teams have created year-round programming to help women in ukraine and israel establish deeper and more meaningful connections to jewish values, texts, and lifecycle events. most importantly, we give them the knowledge and tools to serve as advocates, exponentially expanding the humanitarian assistance we deploy.
