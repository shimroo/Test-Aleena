petition
save imperiled monarch butterflies
monarch butterflies are facing more dangers than ever: habitat loss, climate change, and pesticides like glyphosate and neonics. the u.s. fish and wildlife service recently took a major step toward protecting monarchs—and now we must show the trump administration that there’s massive support for protecting monarchs and other pollinators. the public comment period is open until march 12!
