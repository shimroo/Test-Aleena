   the process inspector!        
































grant riveters has                           implemented the 

process inspector                           controller to its riveter product line. the control                           manufactured by the process inspector company, llc                           which has been developed specifically for the riveting                           and press industries. this is a very unique control                           system that guarantees your operator is forming                           perfect parts consistently. this user friendly control                           alerts the operator to non-conforming parts while                           providing real-time force and distance data.  this                           state of the art control package is a custom plc/hmi                           featuring an all-in-one high resolution color                           touch-screen control with a digital readout offering                           easy set up of force and distance triggers. programs                           are automatically generated with simple input of high                           low distance and force data which are saved to your                           preferred name. this control is so precise it allows                           our riveter to form parts at different heights                           consistently without the need of adjustments. so                           precise we can rivet thru glass as demonstrated on the                           left while having the machine set to over stroke by a                           1/4". now ask the other guys to do that! bruce                           mcnaughton, a member of grant riveters says "this is                           the simplest force and distance control in the world.                           it really is easy to set up in less than five                           minutes!"

grant
riveters 
            method is the tailor-made system of fitting the machine to the job 
            - rather than the common practice of attempting to fit the job to 
            some standard stock model riveter. for that reason the comprehensive 
            grant product line includes all of the recognized methods of riveting, 
            including orbital, spin riveting, 
            impact, squeeze, blind and press type.
