what's going on in the florida conference?

in the latest issue of celebrate florida, rev. john vertigan reminisces about the 2015 fall gathering when he was called to serve as conference minister, and conference moderator lynn jones introduces transitional conference minister rev. nayiri karjian, who will start in her new role on sept. 1. in addition, you can learn about "the church of mushrooms," earth day 2024 activities at several of our churches, and many more interesting happenings at ucc churches across florida! read all about it! 






missing our emails?

if you've been missing our e-celebrate and celebrate florida email newsletters, you may have missed the announcement last december that we discontinued e-celebrate, which had been published every other week, in favor of a new weekly newsletter that we're calling the sunshine connection until we come up with a better name. if you'd like to start receiving the sunshine connection, you can sign up here. in addition, starting this year, celebrate florida will be published quarterly, at the end of march, june, september and december, rather than every other month as it had been. if you've already subscribed, you don't need to do anything. if you'd like to subscribe or update your email address, go here.
