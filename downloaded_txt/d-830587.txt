3m's experience with the mansion on o street was outstanding, beginning with the personalized attention we got throughout the planning process and ending with the execution of an extraordinary private event. our guests were thrilled to visit a place that was not a common destination for most dc tourists, and even with such great anticipation, their expectations were far exceeded. thanks to the world-class staff for making this a truly memorable experience.
