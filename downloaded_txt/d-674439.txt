we make everything on site! located in the heart of beautiful and historic defuniak springs, florida, chautauqua winery prides itself on producing high-quality, handcrafted wines using only the best grapes. our grapes are sourced from the finest vineyards. just 12 miles north of the facility, we grow two native grape varieties called carlos muscadine and noble muscadine. muscadine isn’t the only type of wine you can find here. we carry chardonnay, merlot, concord, and fruit wines, as well. our wines are made using traditional winemaking techniques that have been perfected over the years. we believe that wine is more than just a drink; it's an experience. that's why we've created a warm and inviting atmosphere  where visitors can sample our wines, learn about winemaking, join our wine club, attend wine festivals and enjoy the vast outdoor space for sipping and socializing.you can find our entire wine collection in our online shop. take a look around our site to learn more.
