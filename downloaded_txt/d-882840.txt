so my lazy ass finally got hired somewhere! oh my yes it's true. steak n' shake, which is like a glorified applewoods mixed with friendly's. ok i thought the uniforms at mcdonalds were bad. they pale in comparison to what gayness i must don at my new job. same oxford cut white button down shirt and black slacks rule. but to gay it up some more, i have to wear a red bow tie, and one of those old school paper hats *hurls*. and to top it off an apron. yea it's ultra gay but it is just a stepping stone until i can get a job at a nice resturaunt like applebee's or chilli's. i only get 6.75$ an hour but with my work ethic and the raise system there i will be making bank in no time. i get paid bi-weekly wich i fucking hate but hey gotta do what you gotta do. i got a call from lowes home improvement store and they want me to go in for an interveiw thursday at 3:00. i dunno if i am going to go but i might. well don't have much more to say.

well i am finally 18, i can do more cool things like go to jail, get drafted, buy ciggs, lottery, and best of all porn! i can also now work on getting a job finally maybe someone will hire me. i have been out of the lj loop for some time me and amber are just enjoying life together it's nice without all the interuptions all the time. sure we bicker here and there but what good couple doesn't. we truly are as happy as can be. my birthday was cool yesterday. i got to wake up next to amber in our own bed which i think is the best birthday present of all! ::sigh:: i am just smitten by her. then we chilled around all day, and watched what amber gave me which was two gwar dvd's "it's sleazy" and "rendezvous with ragnorok" awsome awsome! she also got me an aqua teen hunger force dvd that was bootleg and only works on the comp but it has three seasons so thats rocks! she also got me "devil may cry 2" for ps2 which i have been dying to play for a long time. she says i have another present coming as well, but i am at a loss to know what it is. anyways at 11:11 (which is the time i was born) my mom and jay call me and sing happy birthday over the phone. awww. then they said they had to go shopping for me! yay! well we invited them over to have hamburgers and fries (because i am chef extrodinare) haha! they brought pot right away haha! then we went over to my moms place. to have cake and junk. they bring out the cake and it is the coolest fucking cake in the world. it has the curvey wacked out candle's, green lettering, black frosting, and the cake was like neon green! (if you don't know my fav colors are green and black). they cake was amusing becuase it made everyone look really funny! esp. jay it looked like he perfectly put on black lipstick hahaha! well i think before the cake i opened presents! wazoo! i got 10$ from justin and 10$ from leo, which i am probally going to use for me and ambers anniversery 2 years! eep on march 21st. then i got a liter ok soco! mommy knows me best haha! then i got a bass stand and some nice 1mm nylon picks (becuase i didn't have any). i also got from them "american psycho" on dvd (great movie by the by if no one has seen it) "fight club" on dvd, "ninja scroll" on dvd (which is this killer anime) "aqua teen hunger force" on dvd (the official season number 1) they also said they were going to get me more stuff, but it's no big deal i like all the things i got and i appricate them all. then we came home (me and amber duh!) and she told me to take off all her clothes and give her a massage... well i'm sure you all know where that lead! it was super better than usual! anways i had a good birthday all in all.

two entries in one day ewww, i am becoming a lj nerd. well for those of you who don't understand anything about my family here is just a snipit!fireangyl1219 = my sistersign of flesh = mebob = my supposed father (read on you will understand)donna = the grotesque stepmotherfireangyl1219: hey auto response from sign of flesh: this world can, at times, be so lack lustersign of flesh: hellofireangyl1219: whats upsign of flesh: nothingfireangyl1219: when is amber coming down sign of flesh: tommorowfireangyl1219: really how is she getting there?did you get a job yet sign of flesh: plane and nosign of flesh: i told you i was waiting until i turned 18fireangyl1219: ahhh i see fireangyl1219: i didn't know if you got one in the mean time fireangyl1219: still lookin at applebees?sign of flesh: yesfireangyl1219: cool cool fireangyl1219: is mom working sign of flesh: yesfireangyl1219: are you ok fireangyl1219: do you not feel like talking sign of flesh: just amber stuff thats all, she really gets under my skin sometimessign of flesh: thats allfireangyl1219: really? what happened, and is she going to stay on the couch while you wait to get an apartment?sign of flesh: we have the apartment alreadysign of flesh: she just doesn't understand how i feel about thingssign of flesh: and she is stressed so it never makes it easierfireangyl1219: like what? you can talk to me sign of flesh: well i was making conversation (cause she usually sits there and is quiet) and i asked what she does all day and she flips out and is like you don't trust me ect. sign of flesh: and so me not doing anything wrong was quite taken backfireangyl1219: omg that stinks fireangyl1219: i hear that fireangyl1219: does she have a job?fireangyl1219: and is the first months rent free sign of flesh: no and yesfireangyl1219: well at least you have time to start getting paid, and i can understand this whole thing but do you think that is safe to move in together if you don't clear the air about this sign of flesh: yes and nosign of flesh: she has to call me back later but i will probally end up calling her, becuase she doesn't want anything to do with "my" problemsfireangyl1219: yeah just try to talk to her about it calmly sign of flesh: i did the entire convosign of flesh: her mom came home and she rushed to get off the phonefireangyl1219: you know i worry about you right sign of flesh: no not reallyfireangyl1219: i miss having you around sign of flesh: nobody on that side of the family seemed to care about my sitiuationfireangyl1219: that's not true sign of flesh: the fact that i have to struggle so much becuase bob was lazy and wanted to run to utahsign of flesh: granted i didn't want to live with him, but stillfireangyl1219: i definetly care and believe or not bob and donna ask me about you all the time they really miss talking to you but are scared to call because they are afraid of your reactionsign of flesh: he hasn't ever called on a birthday or christmas,or anythingfireangyl1219: they are scared they wanna call trust me sign of flesh: well they should be they totally fucked me overfireangyl1219: how!sign of flesh: and yes i do resent themsign of flesh: ok, throwing me into the financial situation they did is not fucking me over?fireangyl1219: you are the one who ran away and trust me i am being nuetral on this as an outsider fireangyl1219: what financial situation fireangyl1219: living with mom was not supposed to entail you paying the bills both rob and i agree that's not right sign of flesh: see you have been so absent from my life that you don't understand that mom and jay go from paycheck to paycheck, everything i have ever had i had to buysign of flesh: i have to buy my own foodsign of flesh: and pretty much had to since 16sign of flesh: well whether it is right or notsign of flesh: it needs to be donesign of flesh: or the bills don't get paidfireangyl1219: i understand that from someone who lives on my own but the thing that you sometimes you don't see is  that they didn't force you into this situation you wanted to live with mom sign of flesh: yes, but don't you see the childish manner in which they "disposed" of mesign of flesh: and there plan to move to utah seemed to bubble to fruition right after thatfireangyl1219: they didn't though, you could have come back but you didn't want to sign of flesh: hmmm? coinicedencefireangyl1219: that's not true remember they wanted to move us sophmore year of high school remember that? fireangyl1219: i am not saying that they didn't make mistakes because they did plenty wrong sign of flesh: to say they didn't help put me in the sitiaution i am in now is asisine and you of all people should know thatfireangyl1219: you wanna know something they said to me last time sign of flesh: ?fireangyl1219: they said that if you ever need help that they are there for  you as much as they can be they really miss you and wanna talk to you fireangyl1219: and i know you don't beleive it but whenever i talk to them it's takes me like 20minutes before they stop asking about you sign of flesh: if they wanted to talk to me so bad then how come i never recieved a call any of the years while i was awayfireangyl1219: because it was drama with mom and they figured that you didn't wanna talk-- what it came down to was that you didn't call them becuase you didn't think they cared and the other way around so you were both being stubborn. i think that if you both can just let go of the past you could have more family. i don't think it's worth it to hold grudges. i forgave mom and what she did was far worse fireangyl1219: no one says that you just have to play nice right of the bat and be like daddy i love you but take small itty bitty steps fireangyl1219: and you could start over email which is less threateneing sign of flesh: but for you to decide what the extremities of  my feelings are, is wrong, i don't love them, becuase as a duty to bob's own conscience he "put a roof over my head" that does not mean i should love him, had he been lucid for any amount of time, and had he taken me seriously and treated more as a person than his personal slave i might have bit more respect for him, had he been honest with me i might respect him more. as unfortunate as it is you will probally never see the true demon in that man. he has done things you don't know of, and probally even more that i don't know of. he, to me is human filth, the lowest of the low. and no one is going to convince me otherwise unless it is himself, he is supposed to be an adult why doesn't he take a step up and be the man he claims to be!fireangyl1219: he's fucked up everyone knows that sign of flesh: but to what extemes is what you all fail to seefireangyl1219: who is you all sign of flesh: you and rob mainly, but any others who fail to see it as wellfireangyl1219: rick can i tell you something that you promise not to repeat?sign of flesh: yesfireangyl1219: nevermind let me just say one thing just because mom says certain things doesn't always mean that they are true i have found a few faults in some of her stories. from very very very reliable people sign of flesh: it's not mere stories i cling tofireangyl1219: but it's not something that i care about people are people and if you hold grudges you won't have anyone in your life sign of flesh: and to name names who?sign of flesh: for until you make it valid it is just as airy as his claimsfireangyl1219: i am not getting into if because i don't care anymore it's not important fireangyl1219: i care for both of my parents although i don't have respect for either as a parent sign of flesh: becuase you feel a moral obligationsign of flesh: me, i don'tsign of flesh: i decide what i want to decide for my own reasonssign of flesh: i do not simply hold grudgessign of flesh: i hate him for the person he was, is, and always will be. he has never proven to me that he can be anything more than human filthsign of flesh: and i do not need people like that in my lifesign of flesh: hence the choices i have madefireangyl1219: that's fine i can't really tell you how to live your life but he is still part of your family.  sign of flesh: and i only explain these things to you becuase i feel you should know why i feel the way i feel about bobsign of flesh: family?sign of flesh: i dare not call him familyfireangyl1219: that's fine sign of flesh: and why do you?fireangyl1219: im just saying that they still care sign of flesh: why do you consider him family?sign of flesh: i just want your reasoning on the matterfireangyl1219: i consider him someone who cares to his own personal extent (which isn't much) about me fireangyl1219: i have no respect for him because he doens't have respect for me as a father so no i don't see him in that light fireangyl1219: but he is still part of family i didn't choose him but he is part of my family fireangyl1219: just as you and robb are fireangyl1219: i am not going to abandon all of you because i dont' agree with the way that you live you lives, fireangyl1219: i am just saying that they care so if you ever want to make the connection you can sign of flesh: and another thing (to be off the beatin path) bob only tested 94% positive my father and mom was sleeping with his cousin at the time which might explain why i don't resemble bob at allfireangyl1219: other than that you do with your life as you please but i do wanna be a part of it more than i have been fireangyl1219: whatever i don't care about that fireangyl1219: you can disown him if you want sign of flesh: i will live my life and i will decide who particpates in it (for the most part)sign of flesh: but to say i responible for all that, that has lead to all of this is wrongsign of flesh: for it was him who cast the first stonesign of flesh: it was him who could not talk to me on the levelsign of flesh: when i wrote him those letterssign of flesh: it was him who could not face the truthsign of flesh: that he had wronged us allfireangyl1219: once again i said it's none of my business that grudge belongs to you and him sign of flesh: it was him who failed to be a fatherfireangyl1219: but i fogave because i am distant from that sign of flesh: that is your choicesign of flesh: don't expect me to feel the samesign of flesh: becuase our situations are very differentfireangyl1219: i think that you would have  different view of life if you had lived with mom those four years that i did fireangyl1219: you forgave mom right sign of flesh: i know what you went through, i also know what you thought you went through, i had no reason to forgive her other than the fact that she could not be theresign of flesh: and i understoodsign of flesh: i respect her becuase she is honestsign of flesh: not to say she doesn't liesign of flesh: but to people she cares about, she doesn't liefireangyl1219: so you are saying that i misinterpret what i went through in utah? sign of flesh: no but you were young and not in control so the situation undoubtily seemed differentsign of flesh: but that should go without sayingsign of flesh: and not to say you did not suffersign of flesh: becuase i am well aware that you didfireangyl1219: trust me i know exactly what went on i was 12 not 5fireangyl1219: alright i see that this is not going to get us anywhere sign of flesh: do feel it is your duty to?fireangyl1219: to do what?sign of flesh: get us somehweresign of flesh: and what direction were we going?fireangyl1219: well you are my brother i would like to have some of my family in my life sign of flesh: and i am not denying you am i?fireangyl1219: i was just trying to tell you something that they still care about you it's you choice   fireangyl1219: i just wish you could see thorugh a lense not so tainted sign of flesh: tainted?sign of flesh: please do explainfireangyl1219: other than that i am your sister and i will be there for you as much as i can fireangyl1219: other than that i have nothing else to say on that subject sign of flesh: tainted?sign of flesh: please explain!fireangyl1219: it's nothign i am just upset fireangyl1219: because i wish that you could be more forgiving fireangyl1219: but it's your chouce fireangyl1219: don't worry about it sign of flesh: don't say something if it has no meaningfireangyl1219: everything is ok fireangyl1219: i just don't think that you are looking at the whole picture sometimes but it's ok because you feel what you feel and you can't change someones mind when they are set in their ways remember robb sign of flesh: thats the thing i do see the whole picture and am quite disgusted by itfireangyl1219: ok well it all may sound confusing but whatever parts you could make sense of you could probally see that i don't like a majority of my "family". call me heartless, but i don't love people for their title, i love people for who they are, not what they can do for me in life, not becuase they are "blood". fuck that i am so sick of being upset, and the one i love is part of that pain, and it's all becuase she doesn't know. i just need this to all be over and have amber right here. thats all i need!

well isn't my life just a ball of joy. haha not. well i woke up to a bundle of shit this morning, i find out amber is probally going to have to put off her move one more week. i am going to burst if i have to wait any longer to hold her again. god i feel so alone, esp. in a house that is seemingly against me. i still cannot find a job, i swear to god i need to be 18 right now. not now but right now!!! i am going to start selling my things on ebay just so we can afford our apt. and stuff. i feel like such a failure sometimes. also another kick in the nuts. my last high school bristol eastern hell high, wont send me my transcripts becuase i "owe" money. my retard of a math teacher in my junoir year lost my book and well lost all the kids books, and they wont recognize that fact so they say i owe 60$ eat my nut sack! so until i get this worked out i still can do nothing about my diploma. fuck! on an upwards note i met a couple people yesterday. i was out skating looking for jobs (had a psudo-interview and was told not till your 18 fuck!) well on my way back i saw these two punkinsh kids all decked out in black and chains galore. so instead of being the kept to myself angry kid i skated across the highway to say hi. they were cool right off the bat. one was named justin who had his labret pierced. and the other was juice (tj) but people call him juice. well the forst thing i hear is "hey man, you smoke" haha, the hey words for people like me. well come to find out they are both drug dealers hahaha. found my hook up nice and easy. i went to their "house" (it isn't really their's they are homeless but they chill there alot, some kid was there they call him jitt? haha. i guess the house is owned by two other dudes that werent there) they are into good music, the first thing he puts on is killswitch, not to shabby. then he put in as i lay dieing. also not a bad choice. well we were all going to smoke, but lack of papers. i noticed it was five a clock so i was like i gotta split they live just down the street from me in some trailer homish type area. well at least i know some people down here. i made two pieces of art since i have been down here and did more tattoo stuff. so i am happy about that, i miss amber so i want everyone to send her money so she can come down faster!

i don't know what it is, maybe a combination of things. this sudden life change is weird. i am out of touch with a world that i have grown to know and love. i am 1360 miles away from the one i love (by my route). i am trying to quti and cut back on alot of things in my life, plain and simple drugs! i am having to face alot of scary facts about myself. i find more and more wrong with me everyday. i am scared to lose amber. i love her so much. there are alot of people who make comments that piss me off. i don't know if that is a fault on my behalf, or other people but i know it can be a matter of conflict from time to time. my apologies to you amber. you know as well as i, if you are not hapy then i can't be happy. we are happiest when we work together. there is alot of stress and i am failing on my part. i need to do some serious thinking!once again sorry my love, we aren't meant to feel this wayi love you

i am scared shitless, i need money in the worst of ways, if i cannot get a job in the next three days i am not sure if amber will be able to move down in time. i am really a fuckhead, i can't get any job. ha, i didn't even get hired at mcdonalds amber told them to hire me. i am quitting ciggs and cutting back on pot, i am such a scumbag, i need to clean up my act so that i can make some advancements in this shit hole of a world. if anyone wants to send me money go for it. it would mean me being one step closer to amber. ayways i have to go make something of myself or i feel as if i am going to lose it all.

ok well where to begin in my 'o' so eventful day. well first i want to adress something with amber. everytime i talk to her on the phone she is sounding worse and worse as she is slowly dieing. she won't tell me what's wrong and claims that she is always just tired and bored. i wish you would come out and state how feel babe. pinpointing emotions and thoughts is not an easy task. i am not mad, i just wish it was a little easier sometimes you know. but all that aside i think i have figured out the reason to her seemingly increasing depression. i, when talking on the phone usually have good news of some kind or am exited about something. what i think it is, is that she feels as if i am having the time of my life without her and that things are great and yay! and that she is left out on the fun. sweetie although i may be seeing the lighter side of life here and when your not around doesn't mean that i don't loath the fact that you cannot be here with me. i know it is hard i miss you. and i apoligize that i can't call you or talk to you whenever you need but i do have 4 other people here to consider. i love you, and you know that. i can't stand to talk to you when you sound as if your on your death bed. it only sadens me more. and my mom she feels so bad that we couldn't find a way for you to come with us. amber please don't be miserable it is worthless. we can't change our current situation but what we can change is how we deal with it. i love you ok, well our stuff came last night at like 8:00pm. it was already like 3 days late. and we had a couple of stupid russians moving our stuff. first of they come up and are like (in a stupid russian accent) "well it take till 12pm. it is only two of us". so we had to help the movers unload not our job. well the things start pouring in. first thing we seeimportant papers, no lid and shit missing...ok me and my mom are getting reved up.next her box of precious things come in (shotglasses, mugs, memrobilia) smashed! ireplacable things gone, the tote fell over when they were unloading it. they said "it not our fault, you should have packed better". what! it was on from then on for like the next two hours. my mom was hysterical and crying. so i poured her a glass of red wine. more stuff is coming in totes are cracked and smashed. ones that say fragile are being tossed around. i think the worst blow was my mom's pipe broke. it was a going away present when she moved from utah to ct. she has had it for almost 4 years. luckily my pipe made it out safley. i at one point said to the smaller russian guy "i guess they don't have a word for fragile in your stupid language". man i was an asshole, i had every right to be! well more stuff comes in our merchandise spilled everywhere, that is our business. well needles to say my mom was already off the handle so i don't know if there is a term to describe how mad she was. well maybe this will help she went and dug out her knife that her dad gave her. real sharp thing haha and was making stabbing motions behind their backs. well anyways more stuff is broke and chipped and fucked up than i can even tell you right now. do not use american movers aid ever! they will send stupid russians to move your things. well they finally finish bringing it all in. and one of leo's totes has gone missing! well the russians are like "are you going to sign contract, i need to go" my mom "look at this shit there is holes in all the boxes who knows if this shit even works anymore" fat russian "well open, now" my very pissed off mom "fucking exuse me your in my fucking house, you really want me to open all this shit while you check" fat russian "well we not responible for packing" me "yes, but your job is to make sure it gets here all in one piece". well we all go on the hunt for leo tote. nope no where to be found. had his printer, dvd player, dvd's, knifes, tools ect. well it is getting late so i go over to the fat russian and say "do you guys switch the trucks" fat russian "yes we do that" me "well where do you do it" fat russian "why?" me "no where, becuase if it ended up in a warehouse somewhere i want to know that i can get it back" fat russain "oh yea in new york, we do that". well he ended up saying some stupid shit about the job market and blah blah blah. i was like i want our shit and it is your guys fault it ain't here. well there was alot more said and shit but we let them go and told them we would have our insurance claim in a couple of days. well in the midst of cleaning we found leo's tote. yay!, relief well we all just wanted to sit down and chill. we had a couple of beers and were goofing around here are some pics.wow what a night eh, well we topped it off by sitting down to watch underworld wich no one really watched (intro is still playing) haha. well got to bed at about 3 am. haha. and  i have decided that i am indeffinatly quiting ciggs. for the reason that it makes amber really really unhappy. now, all she has to do is be forward with her emotions and then were even. i am going to finish whats in my pack then go cold turkey i did it for 10 months before, i can do it for longer. you gotta understand hun it's give and take. well i am sure if you read all this then your eyeballs are hurting well haha i don't gove a damn!!! haha j/k, i love you sweetie and i need you and no, life is not better without you trust me. come quick!!! much loveses
