					itâ€™s winter in the village. and so far this year weâ€™re having to deal with real winter weather. anticipating this, the service department is always ready to take care of the ice and snow. keeping the village streets, driveways and sidewalks safe and clear is a big job. the next time you see one of our snow plows go by, give them a wave. let them know how much you appreciate what they do for us!
