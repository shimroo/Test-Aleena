how to make a powerful small business website
while there are many great website designers and web design companies out there…and some not so great…almost all of them are focused on building you a great looking, perfectly functioning, standards compliant website…not helping you build an online business!
why?
they forget about search engine visibility (google, bing etc.), traffic and converting visitors to customers. they help you create web pages, shopping carts and payment solutions but do not show you how to get lots of targeted visitors to your site and get them to buy! their job is to build you a website, not build your business.
learn more about effective web design and great diy solutions.
setting up a website quickly & easily from scratch…without going to website design school
perhaps you’ve decided to create a website using an online website builder or web design software. or maybe you’ve chosen a popular content management system (cms) such as wordpress. these diy web hosting site builders require no programming skills and are quick and easy to use…but which is the right solution for you?
build a professional website – low cost design & development services
diy not for you? find your own web designer or developer in the world’s largest marketplace for freelance services.
