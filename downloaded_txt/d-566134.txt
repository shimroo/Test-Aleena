or the almighty dollar? i got a great laugh from it too. every city deserves a book like this.”—colum mccann“brooklyn crime novel isn’t what it says it is. in fact, it takes apart the three words of its title, even as it takes each of them very seriously. it loosens the knot that is brooklyn, city of tangled streets, lost oases, and false fronts. it interrogates what a crime is—a dance? an exchange? a deal gone wrong? a funny mugging? and it opens up what a novel can be. this is no soul-affirming flight; no apotheosis of ‘where i’m from’; no prettified, gentrified tale of trauma; nor is it a winky metafictional gambit; nor a self-important autofictional one. brooklyn crime novel is an inquiry and a tragedy, and as with the oldest crime story ever written, oedipus rex, the judge, detective, victim, and accused are one and the same. a deeply moving, fiercely intelligent, and acerbically funny novel about the scandal and disaster of american capital in our time.”—namwali serpell “tracking the slippery, overlapping paths of gentrification and crime are a vast cast of characters for whom time and space bend and retract in this expansive novel.”—boston globe“jonathan lethem creates a vivid portrait of the borough of brooklyn over 50 years of profound social and economic change. . . . anyone attuned by personal experience to the vibrancy and edginess of new york city life, or who simply enjoys reading about it, will find something to savor here.”—shelf awareness“the latest novel from the bard of brooklyn is a metafictional collage that tells the story of some fifty years in one neighborhood…it’s funny and wise and weird…[a] love letter to brooklyn.”—lithub“a wild, exuberant ambition that pays off and delivers to readers a true achievement: a book at once full of art and grace and mystery…lethem proves again why he is a master of the form.”—crimereads   brooklyn crime novel book tourlos angelesmonday, october 2, 2023 – 7:00pmskylight book1818 n vermont avelos angeles, ca 90027more info baltimorewednesday, october 4, 2023 · 7:00pmenoch pratt free library400 cathedral streetbaltimore, md 21201more infowashington dcthursday, october 5, 2023 – 7:00pmpolitics & prose5015 connecticut ave nwwashington, dc 20008more infonew yorker festivalsaturday oct 7, 2023 – 12:30pmwith colson whiteheadsva theatre,333 west 23rd street, new york, n.y. 10011more infoandes nyjoint reading & discussion with sean howediamond hollow books72 main st.andes, ny 13731more infobrooklyn nywednesday, october 11, 2023 · 7 – 8pmwith jelani cobbst. ann & the holy trinity church157 montague streetbrooklyn, ny 11201more infoalbany nythursday, october 12, 2023 – craft talk 4:30/reading qa 7:30university at albany1400 washington avenuealbany ny 12222more infolawrence, ksraven book store809 massachusettslawrence, ks 66044more infoiowa citysunday, october 15, 2023 – 2:00prairie lights books15 s. dubuque st.iowa city, ia 52240more infosan franciscowednesday, october 18, 2023 · 7:15pmcity lights books261 columbus avenuesan francisco, ca 94133more info   more  writingsbooksnovelsthe arrestecco press, 2020amazon | bookshop | barnes & noble"an exuberantly clever and knowing post-apocalyptic dystopia. .

arrest is a speculative wonder, a joyfully shaggy and unapologetic page-turner of a tale. it is that rare work that manages to be both optimistic and pessimistic at the same time, somehow evoking all sides of what happens after the end. simultaneously a celebration and condemnation of human nature, it’s a compelling read from one of his generation’s finest writers.”-- the maine edge"lethem cleverly builds on and subverts the tropes of postapocalyptic dystopias, mixes in a metafictional element, and expertly mines the nature of storytelling and its power to enchant. an inventive and intelligent speculative tale."-- booklist“as a writer gifted at playing with genre forms and riffing on popular culture, (lethem) enjoys tweaking dystopian-novel conventions.”-- usa today "rarely has

sampling the world after the world has turned away, touching it everywhere, refusing to settle, to join the collective nod. the insomniac brain is a sort of conspiracy theorist as well, believing too much in its own paranoiac importance--as though if it were to blink, then doze, the world might be overrun by some encroaching calamity, which its obsessive musings are somehow fending off.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn “i want what we all want," said carl. "to move certain parts of the interior of myself into the exterior world, to see if they can be embraced.”― jonathan lethem, you don't love me yet“those promises we make to ourselves when we are younger, about how we mean to conduct our adult lives, can it be true we break every last one of them? all except for one, i suppose: the promise to judge ourselves by those standards, the promise to remember the child who would be so appalled by compromise, the child who would find jadedness wicked.”― jonathan lethem“what age is a black boy when he learns he's scary?”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude  “listen to me. i’m shy. i’m not stupid. i can’t meet people’s eyes. i don’t know if you understand what that’s like. there’s a whole world going on around me, i’m aware of that. it’s not because i don’t want to look at you, lucinda. it’s that i don’t want to be seen.”― jonathan lethem, you don't love me yet  “you can't be deep without a surface”― jonathan lethem, you don't love me yet  “someday i'd change my name to shut up and save everybody a lot of time.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn  “i learned to write fiction the way i learned to read fiction - by skipping the parts that bored me.”― jonathan lethem  “every room i've lived in since i was given my own room at eleven was lined with, and usually overfull of, books. my employment in bookstores was always continuous with my private hours: shelving and alphabetizing, building shelves, and browsing-- in my collection and others-- in order to understand a small amount about the widest possible number of books. such numbers of books are constantly acquired that constant culling is necessary; if i slouch in this discipline, the books erupt. i've also bricked myself in with music--vinyl records, then compact discs. my homes have been improbably information-dense, like capsules for survival of a nuclear war, or models of the interior of my own skull. that comparison--room as brain-- is one i've often reached for in describing the rooms of others, but it began with the suspicion that i'd externalized my own brain, for anyone who cared to look.”― jonathan lethem, the disappointment artist“there were days when no kid came out of his house without looking around. the week after halloween had a quality both hungover and ominous, the light pitched, the sky smashed against the rooftops.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“my inner chemistry had been hijacked by a mad scientist, who poured the fizzy, volatile contents of my heart from a test tube marked sober reality into another labeled sunny delusion, and back again, faster and faster, until the floor of my life was slick with spillage.”― jonathan lethem, as she climbed across the table“what exactly is postmodernism, except modernism without the anxiety?”― jonathan lethem“dylan's friend linus millberg appears out of the crowd with a cup of beer and shouts, 'dorothy is john lennon, the scarecrow is paul mccartney, the tin woodman is george harrison, the lion's ringo.''star trek,' commands dylan over the lousy twangy country cb's is playing between sets.'easy,' linus shouts back. "kirk's john, spock's paul, bones is george, scotty is ringo. or chekov, after the first season. doesn't matter, it's like a scotty-chekov-combination ringo. spare parts are always surplus georges or ringos.''but isn't spock-lacks-a-heart and mccoy-lacks-a-brain like woodman and scarecrow? so dorothy's kirk?''you don't get it. that's just a superficial coincidence. the beatle thing is an archetype, it's like the basic human formation. everything naturally forms into a beatles, people can't help it.''say the types again.''responsible-parent genius-parent genius-child clown-child.''okay, do star wars.''luke paul, han solo john, chewbacca george, the robots ringo.''tonight show.''uh, johnny carson paul, the guest john, ed mcmahon ringo, whatisname george.''doc severinson.''yeah, right. see, everything revolves around john, even paul. that's why john's the guest.''and severinson's quiet but talented, like a wookie.''you begin to understand.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“...don't rupture another's illusion unless you're positive the alternative you offer is more worthwhile than that from which you're wrenching them. interrogate your solipsism: does it offer any better a home than the delusions you're reaching to shatter?”― jonathan lethem, chronic city “some people have things written all over their faces; the big guy had a couple of words misspelled in crayon on his.”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music “my heart, to put it more simply, got nostalgic for the present. always a bad sign.”― jonathan lethem, as she climbed across the table“anyone could see it all coming and no one could possibly stop it and that was the beautiful thing. friday night was open wide and writ in stone”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“apologies aren't something you want to get in the habit of practicing in the mirror”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music“consensual reality is both fragile and elastic, and it heals like the skin of a bubble.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“my heart and the elevator, a plummet inside a plummet.”― jonathan lethem, as she climbed across the table“it was often this way, life consisted of a series of false beginnings, bluff declarations of arrival to destinations not even glimpsed.”― jonathan lethem, you don't love me yet“enough of this. does every conversation with you have to be the director's cut? get out of the car.”― jonathan lethem , motherless brooklyn“to the resentment that hides inside love, to the loneliness that hides among companions.”― jonathan lethem, you don't love me yet“a shadow strolled past the car, indifferent to our curbside melodrama. this was my second time imperiled in a a parked vehicle in the space of three hours. i wondered what goonish spectacles i'd overlooked in my own career as a pavement walker.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“i jotted the name down mentally on that tattered notepad i call a memory. the pen skipped.”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music“tourette's is just one big lifetime of tag, really. the world (or my brain---same thing) appoints me it, again and again. so i tag back. can it do otherwise? if you've ever been it you know the answer.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“i'm tightly wound. i'm a loose cannon. both - i'm a tightly wound loose cannon, a tight loose.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“nobody said anything while i opened the bag and took out the egg salad sandwich. it was one of those funny moments when a bit of normal human activity embarrasses everybody out of their bluster and hostility, and roles are momentarily laid aside.”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music“eighth grade's a distant rumor, a tabled issue, and dylan knows from experience that the summer between might change anything, everything. he and mingus rude too and even arthur lomb for that matter are released from the paint-by-numbers page of their schooldays, from their preformatted roles as truant or victim, freed to an unspoiled summer, that inviting medium for doodling in self-transformation. ”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“but the day i can't shrug off a twinge of self-pity, is the day i'm washed up for keeps.”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music“she craned up on her toes and kissed my cheek..."don't do that", i said. "you just met me. this is new york.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“the voices may propel you to warble along, or to dance, they may inspire you to seduction or insurrection or inspection or merely to watching a little less television. the voices of barrett rude jr. and the subtle distinctions lead nowhere, though, if not back to your own neighborhood. to the street where you live. to things you left behind.and that's what you need, what you needed all along.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“i'd underestimated him. i assumed anyone who started out gut-punching you in an elevator couldn't have all that much else in his arsenal. for instance, i had no idea he could smile, let alone at such an inappropriate time.”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music“but the stories you told yourself-- which you pretended to recall as if they'd happened every afternoon of an infinite summer-- were really a pocketful of days distorted into legend, another jailhouse exaggeration, like the dimensions of those ballpoint-crosshatched tits or of the purported mountains of blow you once used to enjoy, or how you'd bellowed an avenger's roar when you squeezed the trigger of a pistol you'd actually brandished in self-pissing terror. how often had that hydrant even been opened? did you jet water through a car window, what, twice at best? summer burned a few afternoons long, in the end.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“apparently brooklyn needn't always push itself to be something else, something conscious and anxious, something pointed toward manhattan.... brooklyn might sometimes also be pleased, as here on flatbush, to be its grubby, enduring self.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“it wasn't for children, seventh grade. you could read the stress of even entering the building in the postures of the teachers, the security guards. nobody could relax in such a racial and hormonal disaster area.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“the wind was picking up off the ocean now and the whole coastal scene had a bleak, abandoned look, as though maine in november really belonged to the ragged gulls who wheeled over the sun-worn pier, and the humans had just gotten the news and taken a powder.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“fifth grade was fourth grade with something wrong. nothing changed outright. instead it teetered. you'd pushed futility at public school 38 so long by then you expected the building itself would be embarrassed and quit. the ones who couldn't read still couldn't, the teachers were teaching the same thing for the fifth time now and refusing to meet your eyes, some kids had been left back twice and were the size of janitors. the place was a cage for growing, nothing else. school lunch turned out to be the five-year-plan, the going concern. you couldn't be left back from fish sticks and sloppy joes. you'd retain at the least two thousand half-pint containers of vitamin d-enriched chocolate milk.two black guys from the projects, twins, were actually named ronald and donald macdonald. the twins themselves only shrugged, couldn't be made to agree it was incredible.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“have you ever felt, in the course of reading a detective novel, a guilty thrill of relief at having a character murdered before he can step onto the page and burden you with his actual existence? detective stories always have too many characters anyway. and characters mentioned early on but never sighted, just lingering offstage, take on an awful portentous quality. better to have them gone.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“all thinking is wishful.”― jonathan lethem, you don't love me yet“the key to mostly anything is pretending your first time *isn't*.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“today the tower's flock, the usual birds, flew in a kind of scatter pattern, their paths intricately chaotic, the bunch parting and interweaving like boiling pasta under a pot's lifted lid. it appeared someone had given the birds new instructions, had whispered that there was something to avoid, or someone to fool. i once heard perkus tooth say that he'd woken that morning having dreamed an enigmatic sentence: "paranoia is a flower in the brain." perkus offered this, then smirked and bugged his eyes--the ordinary eye, and the other. i played at amazement (i was amazed, anyway, at the fact that perkus dreamed sentences to begin with). yet i hadn't understood what the words meant to him until now, when i knew for a crucial instant that the birds had been directed to deceive me. that was when i saw the brain's flower. perkus had, i think, been trying to prepare me for how beautiful it was.”― jonathan lethem, chronic city“we were in a middle space then, in a cone of white, father and son moving forward at a certain speed. side by side, not truly quiet but quiescent, two gnarls of human scribble, human cipher, human dream.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“for those whose ganglia were formed pre-tv, the mimetic deployment of pop-culture icons seems at best an annoying tic and at worst a dangerous vapidity that compromises fiction's seriousness by dating it out of the platonic always, where it ought to reside.”― jonathan lethem“i was playing it existential, and maybe a bit stupid, but it was the only way i knew how to play it.”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music“may one plead, your honor, postmodernism as an involuntary condition?”― jonathan lethem, the disappointment artist“there is nothing tourettic about the new york city subways.”― jonathan lethem, motherless brooklyn“the cars rushing below knew nothing. people in cars weren't new yorkers anyway, they'd suffered some basic misunderstanding. the two boys on the walkway, apparently standing still they were moving faster than the cars.nineteen seventy-five.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“i am relaxed. it's just buried under layers of incredulity and panic. but underneath those i'm very relaxed.”― jonathan lethem, as she climbed across the table“the revving heart of my hopefulness, kicked into gear anew, is the most precious thing about me, i refuse to vilify it.”― jonathan lethem, men and cartoons“the stumbling block will turn out to be the traditional one for students of consciousness: the flashlight is incapable of shining on itself, so we can't trust what its light reveals.”― jonathan lethem, fear of music“did i read the new yorker? this question had a dangerous urgency. it wasn't any one writer or article he was worried about, but the font. the meaning embedded, at a preconscious level, by the look of the magazine; the seal, as he described it, that the typography and layout put on dialectical thought. according to perkus, to read the new yorker was to find that you always already agreed, not with the new yorker but, much more dismayingly, with yourself. i tried hard to understand. apparently here was the paranoia susan eldred had warned me of: the new yorker's font was controlling, perhaps assailing, perkus tooth's mind. to defend himself he frequently retyped their articles and printed them out in simple courier, an attempt to dissolve the magazine's oppressive context. once i'd enter his apartment to find him on his carpet with a pair of scissors, furiously slicing up and rearranging an issue of the magazine, trying to shatter its spell on his brain.”― jonathan lethem, chronic city“the dentist swiveled on his heels and disappeared, leaving me there to massage my jaw back into feeling after its brief, masochistic marriage to the top of my wooden desk.”― jonathan lethem, gun, with occasional music“you discovered yourself and what really mattered only after you passed through the lens of the fairy tale, imposed on every human female and male alike, that someone existed out in the forest of the world for you to love and marry.”― jonathan lethem, dissident gardens“i’d forgotten my identity as the world’s most pathetic superhero, become a californian instead. ”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“winter days were static glimpsed between channel flips.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude“terms swarm up to tempt me in the course of this description: greek orthodox, romanesque, flying buttress, etc. these guessing words i find junked in my brain in deranged juxtaposition, like files randomly stuffed into cabinets by a dispirited secretary with no notion of what, if anything, might ever be usefully retrieved. often all language seems this way: a monstrous compendium of embedded histories i’m helpless to understand. i employ it the way a dog drives a car, without grasping how the car came to exist or what makes a combustion engine possible. that is, of course, if dogs drove cars. they don’t. yet i go around forming sentences.”― jonathan lethem, chronic city“did he ever--try?'mingus shrugged. 'he was like you.'what's that mean?'means he tried.'of course. the ring was not a neutral tool. it judged its wearer: aaron doily flew drunkenly, and dylan flew like a coward, only when it didn't matter, at the windles' pond. so if had attuned to robert woolfolk's chaos.don't tell me,' said dylan. 'he flew sideways.'mingus left it vague. he'd always made it his habit to protect their honor against one another--dylan, arthur, robert. to say nothing.”― jonathan lethem, the fortress of solitude  jukeboxlyrics by jonathan lethem  https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/04-walter-salas-humaraim-not-jimsilos-elevated-plane.mp3 walter salas-humara/i’m not jim “elevated plane”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-lee-ranaldo-purloined.mp3 lee ranaldo “purloined”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/01-kristin-lepionka-vaster-than-charlotte-1.mp3 kristin lepionka “vaster than charlotte”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/08-philip-b.-price-sort-of-true.mp3 philip b. price “sort of true”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-jill-sobule-statue-of-liberty-statue-of-liberty-charm.mp3 jill sobule “statue of liberty”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/28-john-linnell-second-longest-night-1.mp3 john linnell “second longest night”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22-gar-krass-fail-my-test.mp3 gar krass “fail my test”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25-michael-hearstone-ring-zero-water.mp3 one ring zero “water”https://jonathanlethem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/21-dan-cranethe-quick-hellos-moth-of-the-bee.mp3 dan crane/the quick hellos “moth of the bee of the birds”   about      © 2025 jonathan lethem · website design by will amato
