sooooo....where have i been the past month?





hello, again beltway boxing fans!  i am writing this to let you know i am still here.  however, life situations forced me to take a break from the beltway boxing scene.  here is a synopsis of what has been going on:right now, the biggest thing in my life is caring for my 89-year-old mother.  she fell ill earlier this year and she stayed for three months in a very bad rehab center.  she is now living with my family and, thankfully, she is doing a lot better.however, caring for her has not allowed me to cover the local boxing scene in the way i would like to. i want to continue to give you the same type of coverage i have over the past 36+ years but i know i can't. right now, i can't go to any cards unless it is an actual work situation (i.e. i get compensated for going).i also have had to deal with my oldest daughter's back surgery as well as trying to find a new job while enjoying the job i have now that -- although i love the job -- doesn't pay me enough money.  i also am trying to iron out legal issues involving my mother's care.i know i have missed some great moments in local boxing -- gervonta davis's recent title defense, the big amateur wins for jahmal harvey and quincey williams as well as all the cards that have popped up locally.  trust me, i have been cheering all of you on from the sidelines.thank god for my partner, juan marshall, who has truly elevated covering the local scene with his great work.  please continue to go to proam fight talk for complete coverage of the local scene. buti hope to be back on here and on my podcast soon but right now, i can't make any promises.  thank you for all your prayers and well wishes.  take care!

maestre stripped of interim wba welterweight title!





more fallout from the controversial result of the august 7th bout between upper marlboro, md welterweight mykal "the professor" fox and gabriel maestre of venezuela. according to dan rafael, the world boxing association (wba) has stripped maestre of the interim welterweight title.the wba also said that it will "respectfully request the minnesota commission to declare the bout a no contest."also, the wba has moved their suspension of judge gloria martinez rizzo from six months to an indefinite suspension.  however, the suspension was not because of her outrageous 117-110 score in favor of maestre.  the suspension was due to her racist tweets towards blacks found in 2020 on her now-deleted twitter account.the outcome of the fox-maestre bout has caused the wba to face intense scrutiny from fans, media and the association of boxing commissions.  the bout exposed how the organization has conducted itself in terms of the proliferation of numerous titles, how it appoints judges in states without strong commissions and the many appearances of conflicts of interest.  the fox-maestre bout was a big example of two conflicts of interest: maestre and wba president gilberto mendoza are both from venezuela and rizzo's husband has clear ties to the wba.abc president mike mazzulli sent mendoza a letter earlier this week saying that wba having at least three titles per division "is misleading to the public and the boxers."  the letter also said that if the wba does not clean up its act, the abc would recommend to its membership that it not recognize wba-sanctioned bouts in the united states.  a move like that would put the wba out of business because the vast majority of its revenue comes from bouts held in the united states.  mazzulli's letter also said it could recommend that abc members bar the wba from having any role in recommending officials for its bouts and from allowing wba supervisors at ringside.

wba orders immediate fox-maestre rematch; judge martinez rizzo under suspension!





the fallout from the saturday, august 7th bout between upper marlboro, md welterweight mykal "the professor" fox and venezuelan gabriel maestre is coming fast and furious.the world boxing association (wba) has called for an immediate rematch of the bout that was held in minneapolis, mn.  fox lost a widely-disputed 12-round unanimous decision despite knocking down maestre in the second round.  the bout was televised by fox tv.  judges david singh (114-113), john mariano (115-112) and gloria martinez-rizzo (117-110) all scored the bout for maestre despite fox's brilliant performance on that evening.  the interim wba welterweight title was on the line and that prompted fox's promoter, marshall kauffman of kings promotions, to ask the wba for the immediate rematch.however, the wba, according to their rules, has conditions for ordering a rematch.  per wba rule c.26 covering contested decisions in championship contests, “a bout decision may be contested by a boxer if within ten (10) days of the decision the boxer submits payment of a $10,000.00 fee, and the following:a)     a concise statement by the boxer or his authorized agent setting forth the grounds on which the challenge has been brought, arguments and authority in support, and identification of other persons with a material interest likely to be affected by a decision on the challenge.b)     for the person filing the challenge, the following information: • a postal address; • an email address (if one exists); • a facsimile address; • a telephone number; and • a signature of the boxer on whose behalf the challenge is filed.c)     if the challenge is signed by someone other than a boxer, a certified statement of authorization by the boxer to file the challenge.“for good cause, the president may waive all or part of the fee. the fee must be paid by certified or cashier’s check or wire transfer, and will not be set off against any amount claimed due by the party contesting the decisions. the committee may request that the international officials committee, or a special officials committee, evaluate the fight and give their opinion and recommendations to the committee. the championship committee, in its sole discretion, may order the boxers fight a rematch. failure to timely pay the fee or contest the decision shall waive any and all right, claim, or argument of the boxer or his representatives to contest a decision.according to boxingscene.com, the wba is also saying the outcome of the bout will be under an independent investigation and all three judges will be interviewed separately.meanwhile, one of the judges is already under fire. espn.com is reporting that gloria martinez rizzo, the judge who had the outrageous 117-110 score, has been suspended by the wba for six months. wba president gilberto mendoza told espn that rizzo is under suspension not only for her controversial scorecard on august 7th but for racist tweets that were uncovered on a since-deleted account connected to her.mendoza told espn that he will meet with rizzo on thursday to discuss discipline and possible permanent expulsion from judging any bouts sanctioned by the wba.  after the bout, tweets from 2020 were discovered on rizzo's now-deleted account that were racist in nature, including tweets about michelle obama and lebron james.  also, rizzo is married to someone who has had close ties with the wba."we saw her score was wrong despite the unanimous decision," said mendoza, who was born in venezuela, where the wba is based. "those comments she made in the past -- she might be expelled by the wba."i don't support any kind of racism. i believe in equality...sports are the only thing that brings equality into the world sometimes."also, maestre, a two-time venezuelan olympian, has close ties with mendoza, who is also from venezuela.espn asked for a response from the minnesota office of combative sports concerning whether the result of the bout would be overturned or whether the scoring would be reviewed.  the commission gave no comment but issued a statement saying, "the minnesota office of combative sports has a grievance procedure. however, it is ultimately up to the world boxing association to determine if there is a rematch."mendoza ordered an immediate rematch between maestre and fox but added a few stipulations. mendoza told espn that there will be no champion's advantage; if there is a draw, the title will be vacated. and there will be no special permits to allow an interim fight. premier boxing champions was hoping to match fast-rising prospect eimantas stanionis (who fought to a no-contest against luis collazo on the same card as fox-maestre) against maestre next, sources said. if for some reason the rematch doesn't take place next, the title will be in abeyance."we need to get new judges," mendoza said. "i have a concept of making an academy and bringing people who like boxing to online courses and test them in different parts of the world. i want to step away from the boxing circle and find fans who like boxing [to become judges]."

fox robbed in interim wba title bout in minneapolis!





in one of the worst decisions in recent boxing history, upper marlboro, md welterweight mykal "the professor" fox has lost a unanimous decision to gabriel maestre of barranquilla, colombia by way of venezuela for the vacant interim wba welterweight title at the minneapolis armory in minneapolis, mn. the bout was shown nationally on fox.fox put on a career-defining performance during the bout, outshining maestre at every turn.  he kept maestre off-balance and used his height and reach almost to perfection.  fox knocked down maestre with a counter left hand in the second round and appeared to be in complete control throughout the contest.however, when the scores were announced, judge david singh scored the bout 114-113, judge john mariano had the bout 115-112 and judge gloria martinez rizzo saw the contest an unbelievable 117-110, all for maestre.  this decision should be investigated immediately by the commission in minnesota as well as the association of boxing commissions.fox falls to 22-3, five ko's. maestre is now 4-0, three ko's.  personally, this may replace the derrell coley-oba carr decision in august of 1995 as the worst decision i have ever seen for a beltway boxer.
