recently had a wallbed installed in our new loft conversion. looks and works great. very impressed with the wallbed as it  feels very well made. the bed is very comfortable to sleep in so there's no trade off between comfort and versatility.  charles okeke manchester

 perfect for my studio flat. i replaced my old fold away bed with a beautiful new loft sofa wallbed. the quality is worth every penny.  zara rothfield london

 london wallbeds really helped us make the most of the limited space we had. the design process was easy and the team supplied us with plenty of options to suit our budget. the wallbed was installed without any fuss and the fit with the room was perfect. we've also recently treated our son to his very own deskbed and once again london wallbeds helped us make all the right choices. we now have space for family visitors and guests, and our son has lots more room to himself now.  mrs j. abingdale surrey

 we spent time with james and his team making sure the bed would fit in our living room which was time well spent. we couldn’t do without it now. it’s been great for guests at christmas and throughout the rest of the year. allan london
