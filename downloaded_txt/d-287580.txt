learn more about us and our motivations for creating this site

what are we excited about? basically, mythology, legends and superstitions. we love fairy tales, folklore, greek and roman gods and more. we're interested in the way the beliefs and tales of the past affect our world today and the way we live our lives.
we're a group of thirty-something mums and dads who want to ensure the myths and legends of our past ancestors and civilizations don't get forgotten. we know that today's younger generation might appear to be uninterested in what has gone before and all they seem to be interested in is the here and now. our own personal experience with our families show that something very different is happening. once the laptops, smartphones and tablets have been stored away for a few hours they want to hear more and more of our ancient stories. we might have put our fairly tales and stories of ghosts and gremlins on the back burner, because we thought our children weren't interested. but you'll be surprised how these old favorites can spark their imagination and bring to life ideas and dreams you might have thought had been lost.
but it's not just the kids who are renewing this interest in myths and legends. there are plenty of grownups too who want to know more about the thoughts and beliefs of those who went before. maybe all these recent comic book heroes have rekindled our imaginations. we really don't know.
over the coming weeks and months we hope to introduce lots more characters, gods and magical people. the world is full of extraordinary stories and we want to share some of these with you. we can't cover them all, so if there's one particular legend or myth you want to know more about then get in touch and let us know.
many of the stories we share were once thought to be true. today, they are the stuff of myths and legends because we've learned a lot throughout history and our eyes have been opened wide. however, there is still the question of whether the tales were ever true. or whether there are elements we should believe. because, after all, many of them could well be based on true events.
we plan to look at the research of some of the worlds experts and writers, explore some of our ancient civilizations and question what was happening all around the world hundreds of years before modern civilization.

history of sport
middle ages.


prehistoric sports
there's a lot of information in the web about ancient sports and even some of the best betting sites write on the topic in their blogs. evidence has been found that suggest sporting events such as sprinting and wrestling were taking place as long as 15,300 years ago in the upper paleolithic period. the evidence is in the form of cave paintings that were found in the lascaux caves in france. a wrestling match was depicted in a cave painting found in the bayankhongor province of mongolia that was done during the neolithic age, 7000 bce. there has also been rock art depicting swimming and archery that was created around 6000 bce. and prehistoric cave painting found in japan show a sport that looks remarkably like sumo wrestling. >>> 





gaming in ancient civilizations
throughout history.


ancient lottery
some of the earliest evidence relating to gambling has been found in china. tiles have been unearthed that appear to have come from ancient china and it appears they were used for a type of game of chance similar to a lottery type game, and to our modern day game of keno. slips from around 200bc have been found and it's thought they were used as part of a lottery that helped to pay for state works including the great wall of china. >>>
