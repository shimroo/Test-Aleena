              providing excellent boxer shorts on the web since 1996
          

              if this is your first visit to city boxers, boy are you in for
              a treat!
          

              warning: city boxers is not your ordinary boxer short web site.
          

              at city boxers you are in charge. you choose how you want
              your boxers made. with tens of thousands of possible choice
              combinations, i sure hope you like choice as much as i do.
          

              choice is great, but, this is not what we are known for. our boxer shorts
              are extraordinarily well made and more comfortable than anything you will
              ever wear. if you are a confirmed boxer short wearer, don't miss out on
              this opportunity to try the best! if, on the other hand, you are contemplating
              a switch to boxer shorts, our boxers will give you the best possible
              impression of boxer shorts.
          

              maybe you will even become a boxer short fanatic like me!

                  (by us in the state of maine)

              ðŸŒƒ generous, 3-panel designs

                  like the one above, where	the '3-panel designs' section of the statement is in
                  red. this is clickable to get to more information about the highlighted subject.)
              


              ðŸŒ‡ large 5/8-inch fly button

                  instead of the button, or even without the fly opening).
              


              ðŸŒƒ you can choose the type of waistband you want

              ðŸŒ‡ incredibly informative and easy-to-navigate web site
              
                  (do browse around here--there is more information here than you can shake
                  a stick at--whatever that means!)
              


              ðŸŒƒ secure order processing
          

              ðŸŒ‡ excellent customer service
          

              ðŸŒƒ reasonable prices and shipping charges
          

              all of the boxers created here at city boxers are cut and sewn
              to your exact specifications. since we cut your boxers individually,
              each pair can be cut to more exacting tolerances. and, we can offer
              precision sizing for you 
              (no one else is going to offer you 40 different sizes!) and
              optional fly fasteners 
              (buttons, snaps, no fastener, no fly). if you have never shopped
              here before, you may want to check our how to shop at city boxers pop-up
              page.

              gorgeous portuguese flannels
          






              097 - white stewart flannel
          

              another variant of the famous royal stewart tartan. this one has white as the
              predominant color, rather than red as in the royal stewart, and black as in the
              black stewart. these are still portuguese yarn-dyed flannel of a very high
              quality. soft, plyable and durable.
