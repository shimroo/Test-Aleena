client testimonial






a lot of people say that guns like this are good for beginners well im not a beginner but still decided to get this gun and i have become fond to know that its definitely not just for beginners. this gun shoots very accurate and has not jammed on me since i have had it. it will shoot just as good as any of your other 68 calibers like tippman and jt. this is an amazing gun and i would recommend it to everyone!


spyder victor paintball gun
great for anyone




this gun is incredibly accurate and rugged. i got sand in my mags during a round and had to keep trucking so the gun and mags got piled with paint but it cleared up once i tossed on a hopper with no cleaning. wish i had pictures of the internals to show what this thing powered through.


tippmann stormer elite
this guns a beast





great gun, if you are looking to start off or get back in to the game of paintball and compete with the others that are into outdoor sports. this empire mini gs is amazing!
