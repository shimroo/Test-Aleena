shopping for a cremation urn can feel overwhelming, especially when a loss is recent. there are many answers to the question of where to buy urns for ashes, but not all retailers are the same. at perfect memorials, we have a wide selection of funeral urns for sale, catering to all interests, style preferences, and budgets, and we're here to make your purchase an easy one. consider, first, which type of material you'd prefer, then browse our categories of urns for ashes featuring a variety of shapes, sizes, and designs. in case you still find choosing difficult, we offer a complete cremation memorial buyer's guide to help you find the burial urn you need to preserve your loved one's memory.
in our extensive online catalog, you'll find cremation urns for human ashes and urns for pets, as well as small urns to be used as keepsakes if you intend to keep only a portion of cremains.
choosing a custom urn
after the loss of a loved one, many people choose to honor the person's memory by keeping their cremated ashes, also known as cremains, secure in a beautiful storage container. memorial urns can be made of almost any material, from metal to stone to wood, and come in a variety of different shapes. while many people prefer a more traditional vase-style funeral urn, other options include chests, cubes, heart-shaped containers, and more. if you're looking for a truly custom cremation urn, consider personalization by selecting from one of our urn styles based on your loved one's favorite sports or symbols – like birds or butterflies – and then have it engraved with a favorite quote.
please note that, if the burial urn will be placed in a cemetery or other facility, you may be required to have the name of the deceased directly engraved onto the urn. this is another reason to opt for a personalized urn. not all urns can be directly engraved, so make sure that you choose an option that fulfills this requirement.
you can also contact our support team for assistance in finding the best custom urn for ashes to fit your specific needs by calling 1-800-979-8767. we offer various shipping services ranging from 5 to 7 business days to one-day delivery. if your order meets our minimum threshold, you may qualify for free shipping.
