institute for social ecology 



popular education for a free and ecological society 










for over fifty years, the institute for social ecology has offered experiential radical education for grassroots organizing and community-building: out of our home base in north-central vermont, online, and with host partners around north america. we are tireless movement educators for direct democracy, social revolution, and reharmonizing human society with the rest of nature.
