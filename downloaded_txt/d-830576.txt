                  since 1995







  


welcome 
                  to greens weathervanes. we are metal sculptors with a passion 
                  for the custom copper weathervane & fine art tradition; 
                  championing the weathervanes 2,000 year old history & testing 
                  the boundaries of what is expected. set up on the island of 
                  martha's vineyard in 1995, the studio embraces everything from 
                  elaborate victorian designs to realistic birds, heraldry, traditional 
                  weathercocks, figurative sculpture, and even whimsical characters 
                  like mr. toad & alice's white rabbit. we love wild, moody 
                  weathervanes with loads of style and grace! so, after 
                  20 years of coppersmithing, come and see the wonderful world 
                  of greensvanes.co.uk......pristinely 
                  hand-made in england from the finest sheet copper, brass & 
                  bronze with 231/2 
                  k english gold leaf..

                a fluid, almost living work of art 
                which changes daily with the weather.
                it glistens, it glides, it is majestic, simple,
                elegant and quite frankly stunning."t.b.,
