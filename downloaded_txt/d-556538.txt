Â 





mrs. mary kate carpenter was appointed the first* postmistress of gainesville, texas in 1867 and established the post office in the living room of this home at the corner of dixon and pecan streets. the same room was the dining room of her grandson, jack howeth, some eighty years later.(see pg. 47, 'first 100 years in cooke county' by a. morton smith, 1955*see pg. 16, 'early days in cooke county 1847-1873' by c. n. jones)the home was 'quartered' and moved to its present location in woodbine in early 1970s. it has been under restoration ever since and it is truly a labor of love !
