testimonials

 i spent the last few months deciding whether or not to undergo with my personal project – to
design and build a tropical haven at my sea view residence in fort lauderdale. when i stepped
into safari with my ideas they reassured me that they would be able to put together 3d
renderings of whatever i decided to go for at no extra cost. thanks to their drawings, i was able
to see for myself exactly what my ideas would aesthetically translate to. today, i am enjoying an
array of safari thatch products including, a 25’ in diameter natural thatch gazebo, a tiki bar, 3
umbrellas and bamboo fencing around my perimeter.alpiersenmy experience with safari thatch has been exceptional. i was really impressed with their service and professionalism from the moment i walked into their warehouse for help to the point that the products i ordered were successfully installed at my house.ollie p.safari possesses the materials and know-how to transform the simplest of spaces in your home into a tropical paradise. they have a large variety or materials and products to suit your needs. all the products that i ordered were easily installed. i couldn’t be happier with my orders and recommend safari thatch to anyone wishing to undergo some awesome rustic renovations.bmasona friend of mine advised me to get in touch with safari thatch to help me with the tiki hut i always dreamed of building by my poolside. i can’t be more pleased with the customer service i received from the very first phone call i made. safari provided quality materials on time and sent through an easy to follow instruction booklet for the installation of the structure. i am very happy with my new all-natural thatch tiki hut and my family and friends love the tropical atmosphere that it created at home. i can’t stop sitting outside!vicki m.i always wanted a few tropical looking umbrellas by the pool at my holiday home in the florida
keys. i visited safari thatch who presented me a wide range of different products. frankly, i had
no idea i had so many options to choose from between synthetic and natural materials! after
selecting the most suitable materials for my poolside umbrellas and placing the order, safari
delivered within 48 hours. now i feel like i have my very own caribbean resort at my doorstep…
literally.sansone55
