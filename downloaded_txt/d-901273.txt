"we have lived at kfh for a total of almost 4 years, in 3 different houses. the staff is courteous, maintenance is absolutely amazing at resolving any issues which come up, and the houses are good quality. i love living where i feel safe, the kids can run around and play, and i don't have to worry about a thing when it comes to the home or bugs or anything! highly recommend living here! "
