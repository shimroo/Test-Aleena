offering a w.a.y. to h.o.p.e.tm

people come to therapeeds for change. that is what we do. we offer change- for all people- by facilitating the ability of the brain and the mind to grow using the science of neuroplasticity. our brain and evidenced-based, intensive approach focuses on maximizing cutting-edge therapy. we utilize the science that allows us to change the brain at any age and stage of development, providing intervention to people of all ages. our process provides care to parents, children, adolescents and adults, resulting in changed brains and lives across the life-span. learn more by visiting our about us page.

“my 10 year old son has made a huge improvement in his processing abilities. he was at a 5 year old level and after 3 intensives (in a period of 7 months) he is at a 12 year old level. his expressive language has improved enormously. we recommend therapeeds to our friends.”

“i just came back from florida, and an evaluation for my son with the therapeeds team. i walked away from this experience knowing two things for sure; 1) my son is going to be fine with the right intervention, and 2) as an slp, i need to do my job differently.”
