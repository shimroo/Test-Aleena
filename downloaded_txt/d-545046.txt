our storywivla began with a dialogue among karleen koen, janean thompson and martha skow (a writer, an artist and an art consultant) who were members of a professional businesswomen's group. recognizing the organization’s benefits of intellectual stimulation, camaraderie and networking, these friends envisioned a similar group for women artists and writers.much of wivla’s success is due to the philosophy, tone and spirit set in motion by its founders at its first meeting in march 1994. wivla’s first exhibition was held in may 1995. at that reception, 11 writers gave readings of their works and a unique wivla tradition was born. since then, the organization has held exhibitions and readings in galleries, museums and alternative spaces.
