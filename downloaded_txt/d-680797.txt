dear pan american round table members,
it is with a great deal of pride that i compose these few lines to you to express
                                    my heartfelt appreciation for the confidence you expressed in me at the 61st partt
                                    state convention when you elected me as your state director. serving as leader is
                                    not
                                    an easy task but i want to assure you that i will do everything in my power to lead
                                    our
                                    wonderful organization to the best of my ability. professionally, i have had the
                                    greatest
                                    opportunities in education organizations to serve in leadership positions. i learned
                                    much, frequently hitting the âglass ceilingâ. i hope to bring these experiences in
                                    serving
                                    as your leader and making every effort to realize the ideals that our foundress,
                                    florence
                                    terry griswold established for us those of knowledge, friendship and understanding.
                                    these ideals not only drive our organization but stand as beacons of the values that
                                    mrs. griswold hoped to develop in us, the part members.
over 100 years ago, the united states / mexico border was experiencing very
                                    much the same situation that texas faces today. thousand of women and children
                                    fleeing a war-raged country where it was not safe to bring up their children. mrs.
                                    griswold envisioned providing a safe environment in which they could find refuge.
                                    being
                                    struck by this mission, i have selected the theme of âwomen and children, a gift to
                                    the
                                    worldâ for this biennium. i urge all the tables of texas to strive to meet this
                                    goal, to
                                    identify worthy causes in their individual communities that assist women and
                                    children
                                    who are in need of help. many non-profits organization have established means of
                                    assisting their clients, but there is yet much to do. i challenge the table
                                    directors to
                                    search for avenues for their members to pursue. i hope that mrs. griswold is looking
                                    down on us and exclaiming, âwell done sisters, exactly what i had in mindâ.
lastly, as your new state director i will be calling on all of you to serve one for
                                    all and all for one as we work to move our organization forward. the position of
                                    state
                                    director is not one that is fulfilled in isolation but one that calls on all the
                                    members to do
                                    their part as we move towards success. please assist me by doing your part, i look
                                    forward to working alongside of you. god bless each and every one of you. de todo
                                    corazon, mil gracias. one for all, all for one, una para todas y todas para
                                    una.
