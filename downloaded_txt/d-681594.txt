diversity exhibits for your community













family diversity projects is a non-profit organization devoted to helping eliminate prejudice, stereotyping, bullying, and harassment of people who are discriminated against due to sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, race, national origin, religion, and disabilities of all kinds. we tell the stories of real people presented in our eight award-winning traveling photo-text exhibits — in our family, building bridges, love makes a family, authentic selves, road to freedom, of many colors, we have faith and nothing to hide. these exhibits tour communities nationwide in schools (k-12), colleges, houses of worship, libraries, workplaces, museums, corporate headquarters, conferences, and community gatherings. now, we have created online exhibits to meet this moment.

praise for the exhibits“ at a time when dehumanization of people because of their gender identities is all too common, the authentic selves: celebrating trans and nonbinary people and their families exhibit provides a deeply humanizing antidote. it is impossible to view authentic selves, or any of family diversity projects' traveling exhibits, without feeling connected to the people in it. the photos are beautiful and the narratives are compelling, poignant, sometimes funny, and often challenging - in other words, human. the exhibit opens conversations on campus in a way that respects and celebrates our trans and nonbinary students, faculty, and staff and helps us create a safe and inclusive community.” — kira hamman, professor of mathematics, penn state university••••“i have been honored to be on the advisory board of family diversity projects for many years. given the important contribution family diversity projects’ exhibits and books have had over 25 years in schools, colleges, and communities, i recommend family diversity projects’ exhibits and books to teachers, professors, and administrators as among the best educational resources available on diversity themes.” — sonia nieto, ph.d, author of affirming diversity, professor emerita, language, literacy, and culture, university of massachusetts•••• “i just met with our student committee to preview the exhibit and discuss our overall project. i was not prepared for the level of insight and rich dialogue given the ages of the students (9-11 years)! it was one of the most impactful conversations that i've ever had with students, where an organic and authentic discussion delved into family structures, identity, bias, and stereotypes…. we set up the photographs and interviews in a prominent public space in our building, and our next steps are to have classroom teachers introduce the online exhibit to focus on specific topics inside the classroom. the students will be able to go through activities of comparing/contrasting and exploring bias in small group discussions online. this is the work that i love and validates the wonderful opportunity i have to actively engage students in being culturally-responsive learners using the resources offered by family diversity projects.”— amanda mathiesen, principal, hosack elementary school, allison park, pa,the first school to use our online exhibits, in february 2021

donateyou can be a part of family diversity projects' pivotal moment. our heated political climate has shown us how fragile democracy can be. the bullying rhetoric put forward has created an even more urgent need for education, like ours, that celebrates diversity. so at this critical moment in our history, we are redoubling our efforts to reach children, teens, and adults by converting our work into online exhibits and curriculum on this newly reimagined website. family diversity projects is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit, and all donations are tax-deductible.
