on the cover: ian crane, south america. “we were at a lesser-known point with just a couple locals,” says photographer and tsj photo editor grant ellis. “it was late in the day, the light was just getting right, and the waves were solid. ian’s best known for being really progressive, but he’s also smooth. he was experimenting with a four-fin, drawing his turns out as far as he could at full speed.”
