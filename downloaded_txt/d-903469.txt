what couples say about mais oui villa“we had the wonderful experience of being the only bride and groom and had the staff catering to us and us alone (that including our guests too) wow! i keep telling people how better than perfect our wedding was. it was amazing! you will definitely see us again. thanks for everything.” – sam & wendy“everyone here did all they could to see that we were happy and well fed. all of the arrangements were made by phone so we were not sure of how it would all come together but it was quite clear that everyone here (from the florist to the grounds-keeper) knows how to do things right. the lopez and franks family came here pretty much as strangers and (thanks greatly to our experience here) left not only as family (one family) but as friends. the hospitality we were shown made a happy time a memorable experience. thank you all so very very much. you’ve given us a precious gift. love and god’s blessings on all of you at mais oui.”   – lopez/franks wedding
