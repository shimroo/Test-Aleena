	 atlanta speed shop hosts tenth edition of atlanta $10,000 at atlanta dragway

(commerce, 
ga – october 13)  after a 40 year hiatus, atlanta speed shop 
hosted the tenth edition of the popular atlanta $10,000 drag races and car show 
at atlanta dragway on october 13, 2012.
for the history buffs, the atlanta $10,000 was one of the first “big 
money” races held in the country. the 
first nine were held at atlanta speed shop dragway in covington, ga from 1964 to 
1972. nostalgia top fuel and funny cars 
from the 60s were featured, along with a gasser shootout class of vintage race 
cars racing in a chicago style format that thrilled the fans, nostalgia super 
stock cars and nostalgia comp, nostalgia gas and hot rod classes. 


 


 thrilling the fans, the nitro 
burning top fuel dragsters and funny cars were loud and unpredictable. richard hartman’s carolina cruiser ’55 chevy 
was the fastest car on the grounds, posting a best time of 6.262 at 
223.06mph. troy ray brought his “wild 
side” ’69 charger to the event, and gave fans a scare when the suspension broke 
during the burnout, forcing the car over to the wall. randall davis entered his restored 70-1/2 
camaro “dixie twister” that used to belong to houston platt. however, like ray, he was unable to run when 
his “dry hop” broke a radius rod after the car came back down to the 
ground. keith “rooman” burgin from 
australia treated fans to a pass with his “back yard guys” top fueler. following that, julius hughes iii debuted his 
zot vi top fuel dragster, which he and his crew had just finished building at 
6:00 am saturday morning. after a good 
launch, he eased off to a 10.88 at 81 mph.



 


 a “geezer alley” exhibition was set 
up in the midway to allow people to meet and greet racing greats from the past, 
including jim erler who used to announce for atlanta speed shop dragway and gene 
cromer. the car show took up a large 
space in the pits, featuring dozens of examples of hot rods, ranging from “rat 
rods”, which were still plenty fast but a bit lacking in the appearance 
department, to full on customs, like the “creamsicle” sherbet orange 
camaro. the swap meet area also featured 
a plethora of vintage muscle car parts for sale.


 


 tom pellete from spartanburg, sc 
just finished building his version of a nostalgia car and brought it to atlanta 
for its racing debut. it is a 1937 fiat 
altered, featuring a flip-up body, a 239 ford flathead v8 bored out to 267 cubic 
inches, a tube frame and many other old school items. as most do, he took it easy on its first time 
out, easing it to 13 second times in the quarter mile.


 


 in addition to the posted purse, 
class winners (excluding bracket classes) were awarded custom made trophies made 
by atlanta speed shop from former top fuel engine parts, which had seen extreme 
action. the racers raved about the 
trophies, and were as excited about them as the purse.


 


 the final four gasser shootout 
competitors in competition were ron bloomquist (’51 henry j – mooresburg, tn), 
greg porter (’55 chevrolet – greenville, sc), quain stott (’41 willys – 
columbia, nc) and steven mcleod (’67 chevelle – anderson, sc).


 


 andrew wheeler from loganville, ga 
ended his day in the number one spot of nostalgia super stock with his ’74 
charger. wheeler met tim stefina’s 
auburn, ga based ’64 mercury comet in the final, and took the double breakout 
victory after stefina went under his index more than wheeler. wheeler’s times were 10.99 at 121.53mph 
(11.00 index). although he crossed the 
top end stripe 0.08 seconds in front of wheeler, stefina’s 11.47 at 116.78mph 
was 0.03 seconds under his 11.50 index, handing the win to wheeler. stephen moore (’73 duster – winder, ga) and 
mike davis (’66 gto – monroe, ga) earned the semi-finalist’s portion of the 
purse.


 


 nostalgia comp featured a first time 
race winner, jeff sanford, jr from campobello, sc. sanford met former bracket racing usa and 
drag racing usa editor “double a” dale wilson’s alpharetta, ga based front 
engine dragster in the comp final, and got the win with his ’87 spitzer roadster 
after wilson’s machine started losing traction down track. sanford’s time was 10.14 at 101.92mph (10.00 
index) and wilson posted a 10.15 at 88.40mph (9.00 index). “i’ve been third and fifth before, but this 
is the first time i have ever won. i 
can’t wait until next year,” added the happy sanford. richard killian’s wild looking canton, ga 
based ’28 ford, powered by an 820 cubic inch former kaase pro stock engine, 
placed in the semi-final round.


 


 nostalgia gas was won by tom moran 
from walhalla, sc. moran, who began 
racing in 1995, slowed his ’72 swinger to the winning time of 11.36 at 91.19mph 
(10.50 index) after his opponent, joe mclaughlin (’71 nova – mcdonough, ga) fell 
way off pace with an 11.69 at 83.46mph (9.50 index). the semi-finalist pair was erwin aderhold 
(’51 henry j – woodstock, ga) and lou salemi (’65 chevy ii – hoschton, ga). “i was just lucky. it was a fun day. i hope they do it again next year,” added 
moran.


 


 the wagner family entered their cars 
in numerous classes, and by the end of the day, steve wagner was the number one 
man in hot rod. wagner took control of 
the final with a 0.015 react, and then trimmed the speed of his jefferson, ga 
based ’71 duster a little on the top end to a 12.75 at 104.48mph (12.70 dial) 
against john hobb’s beautiful ’55 chevrolet, which had slowed a little more to 
an 11.89 at 112.01mph (11.82). chad 
brewer (’67 camaro – canton, ga) was the lone semi-finalist. “i give god the glory for the win. also, i want to thank abc paint and my family 
for their help. i also had a few lucky 
breaks,” added wagner.


 


 mixing things up a bit, hank wilhelm 
of commerce, ga jumped into the seat of don brown jr’s ’03 spitzer dragster, and 
enjoyed immediate success. he met mark 
milford (’71 vega – canon, ga) in the final, and although milford had a small 
advantage in the reaction time department (.011 to wilhelm’s .034), wilhelm 
prevailed with a 4.76 at 139.17mph (4.74 dial).
milford’s car fell off pace to a 6.27 at 111.19mph (6.20 dial). kevin 
brown of boiling springs, sc was the sole super pro semi-finalist. wilhelm is no stranger to the super pro 
winner’s circle, and has been in three finals just in 2012. “i did everything he told me. thanks to big don for loaning all of the 
parts we needed, and thanks to don jr for the coaching,” added wilhelm. 


 


 until a couple of weeks ago, 
loganville, ga pro racer rob hogue had been out of racing for nearly two 
years. he began making rounds with his 
’68 camaro, earned the runner-up spot at the recent nopi nationals, and then won 
tonight’s pro event against eddie chapman from mcdonough, ga. both racers were wired to the tree (hogue’s 
react was .022 seconds and chapman’s was .020) and neither gave up anything at 
the finish line. after the smoke 
cleared, and the numbers were tallied, hogue scored the win with a 0.02 under 
7.310 at 93.42mph on the 7.33 dial, and chapman broke out a little more with a 
0.027 under 5.993 at 112.54mph (6.02 dial).
brian massingale (v8 powered ’68 vw beetle – mcdonough, ga) and stephen 
moore (’73 duster – winder, ga) ended their day in the semi-final round. “i had a great time. now my wife kim and her son dalton are 
addicted,” added hogue with a smile.


 


 mel abney from cumming, ga added 
another sportsman win under his belt with his ’67 camaro. abney met another wagner family member, nick 
in the final round. abney’s camaro 
crossed the win stripe 0.027 seconds in front of wagner’s jefferson, ga based 
’04 neon, breaking out slightly with an 11.997 at 112.00mph (12.00 dial). however, wagner broke out by a larger margin, 
posting a 12.799 at 106.54mph run (12.86 dial).
steve wagner, who had already won hot rod, made it to the sportsman 
semi-final round, along with mike “critter” garland (’94 infiniti g20t – 
hoschton, ga). “i’m gonna get wagner 
next time,” promised garland. “this has 
been a fun day, with all the nostalgia racers.
i also got lucky in the semis,” abney added.


 


 after several years away from the 
action, david fletcher has been moving up the ladder in pro et motorcycle. tonight he made it back to the winner’s 
circle again.  his final round opponent 
was shawn welch (’82 suzuki – waynesboro, ga).
the round was over as soon as welch left the starting line too soon, 
leaving the red light glowing. rubbing 
it in further, his bike was close to the dial-in time, running 8.801 at 
143.89mph (8.81 dial). fletcher’s 
lawrenceville, ga based ’84 kawasaki also broke out with a 9.187 at 140.78mph 
(9.20 target). paul cavanaugh (’02 
hayabusa – loganville, ga) and brian wilson (’95 suzuki – tallapoosa, ga) were 
the semi-finalists. fletcher thanked 
paul cavanaugh and scott saemisch for all their help with the win. move over tim sutton, fletcher’s on his 
way!


 


 randy barnett of colbert, ga has 
been a year one fast friday regular for quite a while, and made the jump into 
atlanta dragway competition today, doing quite well. his ’08 suzuki was off a little bit in the 
final round, posting a 9.97 at 143.31 (9.70 dial), but it didn’t matter after 
bill benton from cumming, ga lit up the dreaded cherry colored starting line 
bulb with his ’76 honda.  benton’s bike 
went on to a breakout 12.18 at 110.75mph (12.26 dial). steve jackson from bogart, ga and michael 
howard from pelzer, sc made it all the way to the semi-final round.


 


 the last cars on the track were old 
school nitro burning top fuel dragsters, there to show the fans how the racecars 
were push started by their tow vehicles, and then they idled the engines for a 
while in what is called a “cacklefest” with several nitromethane burning engines 
all running at the same time.


 


 after the event was complete, 
promoter julius hughes iii added, “it was a booming success. we had great weather and great 
participation. this was a great start 
for bringing back the atlanta $10,000.”

	 wilson gang goes 1, 2, 3 during first summit et race at atlanta dragway
	 
    


by: amy glover(commerce, ga – march 20) inclement weather stamped out the first scheduled points race of atlanta dragway’s 2010 season, but racers were met with perfect conditions this time around. the spring breeze cooled off the black top and kept racers comfortable throughout the rounds. from the time trials onward, the runs looked good and the reaction times were top notch, guaranteeing a competitive new season. today was especially memorable for the wilson brothers, who finished first, second and third in their respective classes.the super pro finals came down to a door car vs. dragster scenario, ricky page (monroe, ga) in a ’90 mustang against michael morris (woodstock, ga) in his ’01 undercover dragster. page launched first with a .025 reaction time; perhaps inspired by the sticker on his back window that reads “dragster slayer,” morris came after with a .011 green light. morris’s dragster couldn’t catch the track in the cool night air, and crossed the finish line in 5.17 seconds on his 5.09 dial-in time, at 128.79 mph. page claimed the win with a 7.44 et on his 7.43 dial-in, at 91.01 mph. page had some technical difficulties in the first round, but kept to his personal mission to overtake the dragster-dominated field. page thanked mike “peanut” smith for helping him stage the car, and thanked his wife angela: “she lets me come out to race.” page plans on jumping into the 7.50 index of the saturday insanity series, in hopes of leading two classes. john hobbs of conyers, ga was the semi-finalist in his fiery ’71 vega.bruce wilson (tallapoosa,ga) had some good mojo in his ’71 nova, after his brothers finished second and third in the motorcycle class, leaving greg allen (greenwood, sc) with some tough luck in his ’80 camaro. allen left the handicap tree with .086 reaction on a 6.81 dial-in; wilson jumped after with a perfect .000 green, a great head start for his 6.70 dial-in. allen ran a bit too quick, breaking out in 6.74 seconds at 102.08 mph. wilson was the victor with a 6.72 run at 100.48 mph. wilson thanked his wife cassie, who stayed at home, pregnant with another member of the wilson gang, and also thanked his mom and dad, for always supporting the family. “the car was perfect, and i couldn’t ask for better,” wilson commented, “i might come to more points races now that i’ve got a lead.” jeff voyles (hoschton, ga) finished third in a ’69 camaro.matthew bates (loganville, ga) had a bye run into the finals in his black ’99 firebird, and then lined up against sportsman veteran mel abney (cumming, ga) in a ’67 camaro. bates gained the advantage on the tree with a .049 green light, abney trailing with a .066 light. both men broke out, but abney overshot the most with a 13.01 run on a 13.12 dial-in at 106.36 mph; bates got the win light with a 13.58 run on a 13.62 prediction, at 100.82 mph. bates thanked “mom and pop” samantha and john bates: “it’s her car, and he lets me race it.” having raced all the other classes of bracket racing (including bicycles, junior dragsters, high school, sportsman, pro, and super pro), bates has plans to complete the list and bring an ’05 suzuki c50 to the next points race. however, with the 2010 points lead he’s bringing along the firebird to keep his edge in the competition. d.a. streber (greenville, sc) was the semi-finalist in an ’02 hyundai.new racer trent pippin (conyers, ga), son of the renowned nhra pro stock motorcycle racer junior pippin, went on to the finals on his high-performance ’02 buell blast, against michael wilson (tallapoosa, ga) on an ’01 suzuki. pippin left the line first with a .039 reaction on a 15.80 dial; wilson cut an off-pace .415 green light, and couldn’t catch pippin at the top end. pippin set off the win light, crossing first in 16.02 seconds at 81.72 mph, as wilson followed with a 13.29 et at 93.91 mph (11.60 dial). motorcycle racing is certainly in the blood for pippin: “i was mechanic for my dad’s [pro stock] bike, and wanted to see what i could do.” the class has pippin hooked, winning his first race of the two he’s competed in. “i definitely think i’ll come more frequently.” pippin thanked his dad and rick maney, as well as his loving wife sonya. brian wilson (tallapoosa, ga) finished on his ’82 suzuki in the semis.madison lee (12-campobello, sc) enjoyed her second atlanta dragway win, this time at the expense of alex krause (12 – peachtree city, ga). krause had the lucky bye run into the finals against lee, and dialed an 8.96 against lee’s 8.90 dial-in. he then cut a good .040 light, which was quickly matched with lee’s better .039 reaction time. at the big end of the track, however, krause ran a bit too quickly with an 8.90 elapsed time at 72.36 mph, while lee broke out a bit less in 8.88 seconds at 72.45 mph, triumphant with a .03 margin of victory. “i wanted to win this one for chelsey mitchell, a dear friend,” said a happy madison lee. her dad, scott lee added, “i never saw such a string of good lights. can’t put nothing on dad, she did it all herself.” wesley syme (10 – atlanta, ga) finished in the semi-finals.it was a not-so-sweet sixteen final between banks county high tenth grader blake griffith (16 – homer, ga) and kelsey lynn (16 – marietta, ga), both dialed at 7.90. griffith gained the final round advantage in his jr powered motivational tubing car with a .038 reaction against lynn’s .096 light, and crossed the finish line first in 7.95 seconds at 79.40 mph. lynn finished close behind at 7.96 seconds and 83.97 mph. griffith secured the win with a .06 margin of victory. “give god all the praise and honor. this is a great way to start they year,” said his dad scott griffith. jackie lastinger (16 – lilburn, ga) and jennifer jarrett (17 – cartersville, ga) ended the day in the semi-finals.sanctioned by the national hot rod association (nhra), atlanta dragway is located just off i-85 at exit 149 in the banks crossing area of commerce, georgia. information on all 2010 events, including the nitto tire nmra peach state nationals on march 26-28, may be obtained by calling the track office (706-335-2301) or logging on to www.atlantadragway.com .super pro car hometown et mph dial-inwin: ricky page ’90 mustang monroe, ga 7.44 91.01 (7.43)r/u: michael morris ’01 undercover woodstock, ga 5.17 128.79 (5.09)semi: john hobbs ’71 vega conyers, ga———————————————————————————————————————————————pro car hometown et mph dial-inwin: bruce wilson ’71 nova tallapoosa, ga 6.72 100.48 (6.70)r/u: greg allen ’80 camaro greenwood, sc 6.74 102.08 (6.81)semi: jeff voyles ’69 camaro hoschton, ga———————————————————————————————————————————————sportsman car hometown et mph dial-inwin: matthew bates ’99 firebird loganville, ga 13.58 100.82 (13.62)r/u: mel abney ’67 camaro cumming, ga 13.01 106.36 (13.12)semi: d.a. streber ’02 hyundai greenville, sc———————————————————————————————————————————————motorcycle bike hometown et mph dial-inwin: trent pippin ’02 buell blast conyers, ga 16.02 81.72 (15.80)r/u: michael wilson ’01 suzuki tallapoosa, ga 13.29 93.91 (11.60)semi: brian wilson ’82 suzuki tallapoosa, ga———————————————————————————————————————————————8-12 jr dragster age hometown et mph dial-inwin: madison lee 12 campobello, sc 8.88 72.45 (8.90)r/u: alex krause 12 peachtree city, ga 8.90 72.36 (8.96)semi: wesley syme 10 atlanta, ga———————————————————————————————————————————————13-17 jr dragster age hometown et mph dial-inwin: blake griffith 16 homer, ga 7.95 79.40 (7.90)r/u: kelsey lynn 16 marietta, ga 7.96 83.97 (7.90)semi: jackie lastinger 16 lilburn, gasemi: jennifer jarrett 17 cartersville, ga
