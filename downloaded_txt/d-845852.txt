hymn masters quartet 


it's all in the blood
he touched me
happy rhythm
i'll tell it everywhere i go
ten thousand years
hide thou me
one day at a time
he looked beyond my faults
he did it all for me
just a little talk with jesus
oh what a savior
in my father's house
watch what my god can do
he's my king
the lighthouse
























for god
      did not send his son into the world to condemn the world,
      but that through him the world might be saved.  john
