(the specific core of competencies you’re tested on can be found on the official website.) get test prep guides that clearly pinpoint all content, skills and competencies you’re required to know. then stay focused on only what’s really on your exam.   study guides organized in a user-friendly, step-by-step format makes absorbing the material exponentially quicker and easier. you’ll avoid wasting weeks of time (probably hundreds of hours when you add it all up) with study guides and practice tests (that on the surface appear good) but may not relate to the real things that appear on your test.   avoid poorly organized study guides that aggravate you with long-winded jargon that has little or nothing to do with an actual test question (and leads to failure).third, get at least 3 full-length practice tests. many prepared test takers fail because they “know the material,” but are unable to “apply the knowledge” to a professional-level exam. they need to boost their “skill of taking the test.” get practice test questions that accurately reflect the format, wording and difficulty-level of the real test questions you face. taking ‘mirror-like’ practice test questions under simulated testing conditions is one of the best investments of your time and energy in test preparation.is there a test prep program that has all 3 of these critical elements?teaching solutions ‘comprehensive success system’ study guide and ‘exam-like’ practice tests combines all 3 of these critical elements into a proven ‘success system.’we believe in backing up what we promise you and being accountable for your results. therefore, the “comprehensive success system” has a 100% money back guarantee. the guarantee states: you pass your exam (or get the score you need) or your money back. that’s a no quibble, no hassle, no fine print, money back refund if we can’t make you pass after using our proven formula…or are unsatisfied for any reason.all teaching solution’s review books and practice exam questions are developed by licensed educators, nurses, professionals in other fields who are former test takers who passed. they got the score they needed and continue to study your test each month.  every study guide, practice test, one-on-one test coaching, tutoring and mentoring help is 100% up-to-date for the most recent changes by the test developers. 83% of the developers of our preparation materials, practice tests and test coaching system passed (or got top score) in the specific test they coach you to master. 97% of our test prep developers and one-on-one test prep help coaches have a 3-11 year track record (and very high success rate) in helping students and career changers ace their specific exam. if you tried generic, cookie-cutter name brand review books that are out-of-date, lack ‘exam-like’ practice questions, have typos, incorrect information and don’t cover (all your test content), no doubt you feel frustrated and have complaints.  if you feel overwhelmed with the vast amount of preparation required to succeed in the short time between now and your exam date, there’s a solution.  our “comprehensive success system” study guide and “exam-like practice test” solves these problems. you get a faster and easier way to prepare and succeed on your testing date. you get a razor-sharp accurate study guide, practice tests and real ‘human help’ online 7 days per week for your specific test. get the career you deserve. achieve your personal aspirations without test preparation product hype or “big promises” that don’t deliver.go to: the top of this page and click on the link for your specific test.also, check-out our other website examlike.com that specializes in ‘exam-like’ practice tests for your specific exam right now. teaching solutions 228 park ave s, #8323new york, ny 10003-1502 (mailing address in terms of service.) contact us: client serviceshelp desk all trademarks on this website are the property of their respective owners. trademark owners are not affiliated with this website, not involved with the production of it and make no endorsements. teaching solutions is owned by resource solutions, llc. about ussitemapprivacy policyterms of servicecopyright 2025. teaching solutions™. all rights reserved.
