you will notice that this list does not have every state. this is because most states still do not post candidate email addresses on their websites.  some list phone numbers and some only list addresses.   
if your state is not on the list contact your state's election official and request that they put clickable candidate email address on their webpages.  most of them already request this information  on the
forms the candidates file with them.  this helps both the candidates and the voters like yourself.  click here to locate your states election officials.
