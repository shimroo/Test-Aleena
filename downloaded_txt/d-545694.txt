welcome to the rise guys morning show! "the saviors of morning radio" broke the mold when they hit the airwaves in 2003. originating from greenville, south carolina, mattman, fatboy, & paige combine to deliver the south's #1 morning radio show everyday 5-10am. and serve as the leaders of the esteemed "p1 family." relevant and irreverant! gahlay, it's the rise guys! and it is good!
