 experiences
































“the best thing about vlas was determined people to help you, dedicated to helping and doing the best. courteous, respectful, considerate. best experience i ever had in my life.  there should be more offices like this with such wonderful people.”
































“the level of quality i’ve been receiving deserves compensation that i’m unable to provide.”
































“it made a whole lot of difference in my life. it canceled a debt i didn’t remember having due to my seizures.  being on disability i couldn’t have paid all these cost an attorney fee, court fees, and the debt. lifesaver for me.”
