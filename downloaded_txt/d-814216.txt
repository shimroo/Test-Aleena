brown pride riders
welcome to brown pride riders car club's home page.  b.p.r. is a club of respect, pride and unity.  all members share the same love for lowriding.  
lowriding to the members of b.p.r. is not just a hobby, but a way of life.  it's who we are.  b.p.r. is a club of family values.  a club that takes pride in our culture.  we try to set trends for the future generations of the club (as well as other clubs) to follow. 
lowriding to us is showing pride in our car's designs from beginning to end, and showing repect to other fellow riders.  b.p.r. tries to help the lowrider movement to make a mark in the lowrider history books.  
together we can!
   keep on lowriding    b.p.r.
