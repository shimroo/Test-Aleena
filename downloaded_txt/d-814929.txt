st. pat's for all celebrates the diversity of the irish and irish american communities of new york. 















the march that began as a response to the exclusion of irish lgbtq communities from the 5th avenue parade has now been running for more than twenty years, and continues to be the most inclusive and progressive celebration of irish culture and solidarity in the usa. st. pat's for all's motto, "cherishing all the children of the nation equally," is taken from the 1916 easter proclamation of the irish republic; it is a vision drawn from our past and a guide for our present and future.
