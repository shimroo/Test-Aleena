"love this hotel ""we have stayed here twice in the past two years and love this hotel! it is located across the street from the bay and the views are beautiful, especially at sunset. there is a pier with chairs to sit and watch the sunsets, a cozy gas fire pit, a clean refreshing pool and kayaks to check out."nancy h on tripadvisor
