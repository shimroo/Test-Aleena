about us
therapeutic riding allows the rider to react to the three-dimensional rhythmic movement of the horse. it emphasizes the learning of functional riding skills as a means of improving the physical and/or mental wellbeing of the riders. it encompasses disabilities categorized as orthopedic, neurological, and a broad range of others.
the riders who are involved in the riding program range in age from 3 to over 60 years of age and have a wide variety of both physical and developmental disabilities including cerebral palsy, spina bifida, down syndrome, stroke, spinal cord injury, amputees, brain damage, blindness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, global developmental delay, autism and children who are at risk.
the connectwell therapeutic riding program provides individuals a holistic approach to therapy, rehabilitation, recreation and the opportunity to experience freedom and movement astride a horse.
