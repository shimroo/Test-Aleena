thanks to charles carter of the nike veterans and friends facebook group for informing me and posting of ed's obituary. 
i (greg brown) and dave kreutzinger, sf-88 volunter, nike veteran and former launcher warrant of sf-88, attended the memorial along with his friends and family at the chapel of roses in fremont california. 
it was a small gathering. ed was active with the computer history museum in santa clara. there were several members of the computer history museum present. 
ed was involved with the restoration of an ibm 1401 computer from germany that had been in storage for 20 years. it is operational and can be seen at the museum. 
his memorial was a small family gathering indoors. 
there was a military honor guard present who did the flag folding ceremony and gave the flag to ed's wife betty. 
ed is survived by his wife and 3 sons.

i will share a picture of ed one of his volunteer docent trips to sf-88.

he was giving explainations of the nike radar system to young and interested college electrical engineering students
 every time you talked to ed, you left feeling better.

(model) nike launches from ba-79 just outside of baltimore
update aug 9 2024



  dave zuchero - ba-79
  i am working with a group of volunteers who are restoring ba-79 just outside of baltimore.
last week i launched a scale model of the nike hercules from ba-79 off of the one of the
elevator doors.  probably the first time any nike every left the launch site at that base,
lucky for all of us!

update aug 9 2024

 when we last emailed i had flown the model nike hercules off the elevator of ba-79 in md back in 2020.  since then we've been working on a 20 ft one-half scale model for display at the base.

sf-88 visit by dave zuchero february 2025
dave made a trip to sf-88 on jan 31 and feb 1 sf-88 open house.
nike veterans alec gyorfi, david kreutzinger, gordon lunn and greg brown were 
on site to show dave around the radar vans, assembly and warhead buildings and 
a magazine. we support the ba-79 volunteers who tell the nike story, of our nation's first generation missile defense system.



the 6th region aradcom trophy



aradcom annual service practice top firing battery award trophy

for a long time now, we concerned nike veterans wondered what happened to the 6th region aradcom trophy? for us, it was recently found, thanks to the california national guard historian.

while browsing on the nike veterans facebook site, i found a posting from the california national guard museum historian. 
i asked him this question on facebook messinger
do you know where the aradcom trophy is ?
i received this response from our california state military museum director, sgm deniel sebby.

i can assure you that the trophy is not missing.  it was recently displayed at the final reunion of the 1/250th ada and 4/251st ada.  it is stored at the museum support center south camp san luis obispo.  once we procure the proper display case, it will be permanently displayed at the california state military museum located in the new california military department headquarters in rancho cordova.  that facility also serves as a display location for regiments no longer in the force structure, including the 250th and 251st ada.

once installed, i will provide the ada community with an image of the trophy.

i hope this answers your concerns

thank you sgm sebby, for safely preserving our nike history !
our fellow sf-88 volunteer gordon lunn, who was a ltc, (ifc)for the 251st ada los angeles, and sf-88 volunteer, provided me this picture of the trophy.  thanks gordon !
it was displayed at the recent reunion for the california national guard 250/251st. ada reunion.
the 251st was the los angeles national guard ada battalion 
the 250th was the san francisco national guard ada battalion


here is list of the top aradcom firing batteries by year

!! disinformation from copernicus !!

consensus of philosophers agree with aristotle.
disagreeing with aristotle, copernicus  claims:
     a) the earth turns around once a day.
     b) the earth goes around the sun once a year.
     c) the earth is not the center of the universe.
to halt spread of the above disinformation:
     a) copernicus book is on the forbidden list.
     b) giordano bruno didn't recant - burned alive.
     c) galileo recanted - permanent house arrest.
stamp out disinformation and copernicus


is the dgb

roman inquisition ??

sounds like vladimir putin's
 previous employer - the kgb.
the same  kgb of stalin fame.  




introduction


what nike is all about


created in 2021, an excellent 13 minute youtube by scott manley
oddly, i can find nothing to quibble about!  very unusual -
sott also mentions the wwii german aa rocket, the wasserfall,
hand guided, never fielded/used.

nike hercules missile q5 high altitude intercept
	- 1.5 minutes

	

this three minute video
is a (successful :-) test of an early nike ajax destroying a radio controlled ww-ii b-17.
later tests verified that the nike ajax was also a killer of higher flying sub and supersonic jets
such as used by the soviet union.
the next generation was the nike hercules which was faster, longer range, and could carry
nuclear warheads to destroy multiple targets.
    the "plotting room" equipment shown in this video must have been  an engineering prototype -
things were much more crowded when installed in the  two vans -
    among other things, the plotting boards here  are horizontal,
    in the bc van, they are vertical.
the analog computer operational amplifiers are different,
   big tubes here, in the vans they were "miniature" tubes,
   and on and on - the zero set switches
   (the round spinning things in the analog computer)
   were a little different style -
    i think you could say that this equipment was
  "re-packaged" for  field use.

mike stucka, a staff writer for the taunton daily gazette, was looking for images for a nike story
and e-mailed
"this story is interesting, and everyone is so darned helpful."
    ( that story has disappeared - i should have made a "local copy" ! )

i thought for  a bit and replied:
"these were good days for lots of now older folks -
  and we were quite proud of
    - the learning experience - some of us even got a little more "mature" ;-))
    - doing something useful - better than flipping hamburgers or selling shoes ?

"most look back and  smile, and like to share the warm feeling :-))"
 

this site has become a cooperative effort as more than 350 people have
contributed text, stories, ideas, information, and corrections.



the nike surface to air missile system was named after the winged goddess
of victory in greek mythology. two versions of this system defended the u.s.
and other places from hostile aircraft.


 the 1st version, the nike ajax, was deployed
in the u.s. from 1954 to the early 1960s. it had an effective range of 25 miles.

the 2nd version, the nike hercules,
was developed which was faster, had a range of over 75 miles, and had nuclear capability.
the hercules was deployed starting in 1958.
in 1963, there were 134 nike hercules and 77 nike ajax batteries defending the u. s.
  - as per  "rings of supersonic steel".

both versions above are made light and transportable by wheeled vehicles, transportable in cargo planes
for "easy" mobility.  with practice and preparation, a site could be moved in a long, hard day.
as many parts as practical are made of aluminum or magnesium, the standard power frequency is
400 hertz (cycles per second) saving iron and weight in transformers and motors as in aircraft.

the nike hercules sites in the continental united states mostly closed around 1974, with the exception of alaska and florida, which were closed around 1979.

our nato allies continued to utilize the nike hercules air defense system until early 2000's.(with an improved digital computer and all internal electronics upgraded to solid state electronics)

our nato allies de-commissioned the nike hercules in taiwan 2002, italy 2008, greece and turkey 2010.

the patriot missile system mm-104 replaced the nike hercules system in 1981.

the patriot system had better mobile "shoot and scoot" capabilities, and was more of a battlefield weapon

in 2008 the us army placed in service the thaad (terminal high altitude area defense) mobile anti-ballistic missile system, with a 120 mile range and carries no warhead, uses impact to destroy.



this web site does not present photos, histories, nor detailed status of most nike sites.
i link to other web sites take up that interesting challenge.

almost all nike hercules related information has been declassified
- the only exceptions are some iff
 (identification friend or foe) information, some flight
characteristics, and some nuclear warhead information.
this site has a little information on the nike ajax, and no information on
nike zeus  (external link),
   also youtube  a 20-year history of antiballistic missile systems.

i installed and maintained nike ajax fire control equipment (radars & computer)
at  chicago site c-41 during 1955-1957.

maybe "we" deterred "them".


i have served as a volunteer helping restore an old nike site
(sf-88) near san francisco 
for the national park service.

	the missile (with booster) was launched 0.4 seconds ago, is accelerating at
	25 times the force of earth's gravity, has risen 60 feet,
	and it is now going 210 miles per hour.
	
	four seconds from now, the missile will be: 

going 1,700 miles per hour straight up,
	separated from the booster,
		 (the black flaming thing with the white fins),

	turning (diving) towards the intercept point with the target,
	starting the sustainer rocket engine to reach 2,700 miles per hour.
	

	if the target is 90 miles approaching at mach 1.5, the missile will
	meet the target 60 miles away in 90 seconds.
	

	the nike hercules shown here defended major u.s. target areas against
	aircraft attack from 1958 to 1974. it had an effective range of over 75 miles
	and a speed of mach 3.6.  south korea has over 200 of these missiles, with
	associated radars and guidance systems, currently in service.
	

	its predecessor, the smaller nike ajax, was in service from 1954
	through about 1965.  it had a range of 25 miles and a speed of mach 2.5.

intercept - a little more technical ;-))




this is a plot of a nike hercules intercepting a target flying at 52,000 feet.
the vertical scale is altitude in feet. (max 100,000 feet)
    the left trace is the nike missile, the right is the target.
the horizonal scale is computed time to intercept, in seconds.
    the middle is time zero, intercept.
note: against high flying targets such as this, the hercules does not necessarily go above the target.

cover of 2 mbyte brochure
just found this nice piece on ebay.
printing date is 10-15-56.

"the purpose of this booklet is to inform
high-school graduates-and their parents-of
the matchless opportunities that lie within
the army antiaircraft command."

well, most of the once-adressed kids
will be retired by now, but maybe they
remember this booklet.



 its a 3 page folder, size 500mm x 100mm.
(yes i prefer metric)  :)
but look, on the frontcover:
seems that track lima296 has slipped through!!  :))
 it has a beautiful painting inside, and
a funny 70's scene on the backside.






it contains the original team nike decal, and a small brochure.
both items came to me together with the missile master booklet. [600 kb]


the diameter of the decal is 4,06 inch. (103 mm)

with kind regards from germany,




a recruiting brochure featuring the nike hercules, "now making its appearance on-site."

standing guard at the 38th parallel


from richard brody, author of "standing guard at the 38th parallel"
	  - what really pisses me off- glad you asked- is
	that the dogs killed in vietnam have a website dedicated to them, listing each of the
	dog's names. none of the us soldiers lost (killed) in korea after the war, (which never
	really ended), are listed anywhere as casualties. only their moms, wives and families
	know, and some of us who were there and lost buddies :>((

subject: status updat of my foia to redstone arsenal for the history of
the nike hercules weapons system by mary t cagle
from: james newman < jamesnewman1976 @ yahoo . com >
date: mon, july 17, 2017

dear ed,
i just got my foia to redstone arsenal us army material command denied. i am going to appeal within the 60 day time limit. this document was denied under executive order 13526 section 3.3 section 4 "for state of the art technology" the document will remain classified for 50 years from its creation date until 2023. vacuum tube technology of the early to mid-1950s is not state of the art technology. this system went defunct in 1980 when the last nikes were decommissioned in florida and alaska.
