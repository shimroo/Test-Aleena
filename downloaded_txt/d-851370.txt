“anybody can love the mountains, but it takes a soul to love the prairie.” — willa cather



buffalo talesvisit mccook activity guide


the high plains are a special place. the people who settled here, the people who are still here, have persevered. through drought, booms, busts, good times, and hard times. back in the 80’s when times were tough a couple of east coast academics proposed that the entire high plains should be depopulated and given back to the buffalo. they called their idea the “buffalo commons”. they didn’t account for the fierce love that people out here have for their land and communities. they didn’t account for the resourcefulness of our people. so to those academics we say that we’ll still be here, proudly showing visitors the history, outdoor recreation, and rural lifestyle that make mccook such a great place. we’re proudly standing as the capital of the buffalo commons.
