willy adames started spring training a while ago. he has been working out in arizona for about a month, looking to ease his transition to life with the san francisco giants. even with all that extra time, he felt like the first full-squad workout for the team was an exciting day. the addition of adames was the centerpiece of san francisco’s offseason after the team went 80-82 last year. the veteran shortstop signed a $182 million, seven-year contract with the giants in free agency, leaving milwaukee after three-plus seasons. in making that tricky move to a new organization, adames is leaning on previous experience.
