news,readings &workshops

 

i’m sorry to report that i will no longer be holding my june juried intensive poetry workshops.  i can no longer give up four weeks of preparation and the week of the workshop itself.  i need to continue working full time on the hour of my death.  i have informed the poets who were pre-accepted from last year, but applied after the workshop filled, that there won’t be a workshop. i have greatly enjoyed working with the poets who have taken it in the past and will go on reading books most of them have published after the workshop.  i was glad to help so many of them reach a higher level.  i will miss the workshop, but it was time to end it.  some poets want to work with me individually in person or via zoom and that is possible. we’re working out the details with those who have approached me.
