alcohol rehab
alcohol rehabilitation is a long-term process. an alcohol rehab takes places following the completion of an alcohol detox. whilst an alcohol detox is medical procedure, alcohol rehab is a life-long process. alcohol rehab at a residential clinic combines physical, mental and spiritual rehabilitation. you will benefit from evidencie-based therapies, as well as holistic therapies and 12-step programmes.





alcohol detox
alcohol is a physically addictive substance. if you or a loved-one are alcohol dependent, then the safest way to manage the alcohol withdrawal process is to undergo a medicated alcohol detox under supervised conditions. at ok rehab, we are able to arrange for you to under a medical alcohol detox either at your own home, or within a residential detox clinic setting.





drug rehab
many drugs are physcially addictive. this includes an addiction to heroin, benzodiazopines, as well as many common prescription medications. a drug rehab proceeds the drug detox process, and drug rehab helps you recover from a physical, mental and spiritual perspective. 














who are we?
what is ok rehab?
we are
ok rehab is a recovery advocate service. ok rehab was founded by people who are living their lives ‘in recovery’. we aim to offer addiction treatment options for all, no matter what the situation they may be facing right now. all of our helpline advisors have ‘wore the t-shirt when it comes to issues surrounding addiction, including being ‘helpless’, ‘hopeless’, and ‘homeless’. we act as a referral and advisory service in helping signpost your a variety of addiction treatments.
learn more
how we help
we help facilitate treatment for anyone who actively wants to stop using drugs or drinking alcohol. this desire is often easier said than done. if your loved one is in denial about his or her addiction, then we are also able to assist via an intervention programme. we do not offer specific health advice, nor are we a remote clinical advice service (rca). we can, with your consent, pass your details to our partners that can offer this.
learn more
who we help
we help individuals seeking to self-refer themselves into addiction treatment. we also help concerned third parties, such as loved ones, friends, co-workers, and employers who wish to help a person accept the need for addiction treatment.

group therapy for addiction
group therapy is an integral part of modern addiction therapy. peer learning and insight discovery is often far more powerful compared to the more traditional approach of sitting in one-to-one therapy sessions with a registered addiction therapist or counsellor.

what is the role of a psychiatrist in addiction treatment?
there was a time not so long ago when the prospect of using psychiatry to treat addiction would have been seen as baffling. rather than seen as a brain disease [1], substance use disorders were viewed as moral weaknesses needing spiritual treatment rather than psychiatric care. thankfully, increased medical knowledge has updated the principles of […]
