about us
many people walk through life without knowing their true purpose.  at some point, the lucky few people feel like they know what it is that they’re meant to do.  for me, it took all high school and college to figure it out.  consulting is what we do, and it’s something that has the ability to change lives for the better, which makes me a big supporter.  welcome to ca john’s consulting.
ca john’s consulting
i did not take high school seriously, and when i went to college, i chose a major based solely on a minimal workload.  it was nothing related to business.  but half way through freshman year, i realized that business was what i wanted to do.  i helped a friend study for a business consulting class and it was the most interesting thing i’ve ever learned about.  i changed my major the next day and started taking a slew of business classes. fast forward to today, ca john’s consulting is built and growing at a rapid pace.
our consulting company started with an idea, and i grew it from there, working out of my apartment until i picked up enough clients to be able to afford a small office.  from there, i continued to deliver great results and work through a network of referrals, raising my prices, and hiring fantastic business consultants to help me along the way.
today, my team of experts can help with the majority of business problems from sales support and training, to mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, and more.
what we can do to help
let me provide a detailed illustration of what ca john’s consulting can do for you so you understand how our service can help.  so for example, you start a nashville hood cleaning business, acquire your business license, hire some contractors with experience in the restaurant industry, buy a commercial truck, and rent a small office space on broadway in downtown nashville.  but, now you need customers.  where are you going to get them from?  this is where most businesses get stuck.  they’re not sure how to advertise effectively, so they start signing up for things like yellow pages, yelp, and various forms of marketing to generate customers.
ca john’s consulting can help.  we build you a great website to increase brand awareness and get your name out there, we can train your team on the sales process and how to close a high percentage of deals, and we can even teach your contractors how to find leads on their own.  there may be a lot of other hood cleaning companies in nashville, so you need to find a way to differentiate yourself from the rest if you want to succeed.
we can provide the game-changing advice that takes you from a small operation to a state-wide powerhouse.  so, then when someone gets online and looks for local hood cleaning experts, you’re the go-to choice.  and, better yet, when that potential customer calls, you’ve got them hook, line, and sinker.  once you start picking up customers left and right, it’s easy to expand because you’ve got a slew of happy clients that will happily refer you to other businesses or provide a recommendation.
call us today and we’ll help you find more customers and expand your business!
