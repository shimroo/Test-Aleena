iconic

historic york’s prized jewel

tour the yorktowne



terrazzo flooring
did you know that during the initial phases of the restoration, terrazzo flooring was found beneath three layers of carpet in our davidson lobby? beautifully preserved from 1925, we decided to incorporate into the plans for the hotel! come and see this unique find for yourself!

the mailbox
a staple of the hotel since opening in 1925, the cutler mailbox is both a unique and stunning attribute of the hotel. keep an eye out for the brass mail chutes on each guest room floor which carry mail to the lobby through glass enclosures.



revolving door
if only doors could talk, there would be plenty of stories of the many famous guests that have passed through. part of the hotel since opening in 1925, the market street revolving door truly represents the rich character of the yorktowne hotel.

the mural
during construction work on the front desk area, a mural depicting a traveler arriving to his destination was found. after research was conducted, the creator was found to be renowned artist cornelius hicks (who also painted the wellspan ballroom’s george washington). come and see for yourself this striking mural above the hotel’s front desk!

did you know? margaret thatcher was the first woman prime minister of the united kingdom from 1979-1990. she was well known for her uncompromising politics and leadership style which earned her the name “iron lady.” thatcher stayed in suite 214 of the yorktowne hotel during a speaking tour in may 1997. pictured above with veteran yorktowne employee mr. john lambert, mr. louis appell jr. and his wife, mrs. jody appell.
