by combining market insights from both desktop and real world research with a deep understanding of human needs and behaviors, springtime uncovers trends and identifies business opportunities that will resonate with your customers and drive your business. how can circular design strategies for example create new opportunities for your business? let’s find out!










controlled creative chaos
translating business opportunities into creative concepts requires a certain level of chaos. we channel expert intuition and creative sparks through our creative process, and envision, design and develop exciting and paradigm-shifting products that drive businesses and connect to customers on a functional as well as on emotional level. frequent client feedback loops ensure a shared desired outcome.

to accommodate this type of more entrepreneurial interaction with customers and partners in the field of urban mobility, we are introducing the urban mobility lab (uml). uml will be a new venture, a specialist think/do tank that initiates, develops and spins-off products and services in the realm of sustainable (sub-car) urban mobility. uml shareholders will have a say in ideas to develop, co-own any ip developed within uml, and own the first right to invest in spin-off ventures.









currently, several projects are being discussed with potential partners, including the development of our dispatch last-mile delivery vehicle and logistics solution. interested in participating in urban mobility lab, as project partner, investor or both, contact us for more information.
