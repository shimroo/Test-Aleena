library foundation of carver county

how is the library foundation different than the friends of the library?the library foundation of carver county is a separate organization from the friends of the library groups. a friends group supports its individual library branch, while the foundation is focusing on county-wide initiatives that will benefit residents at all branches or through outreach programs and services.  the foundation and friends groups work collaboratively on projects whenever possible.why is the library foundation important?although the carver county government has increased its support of the library system over the past few years, this money is earmarked primarily for staffing and book collections.  many programs and services that residents and library staff want to see the library offer are not possible through current tax dollars. to support these initiatives, the library foundation raises funds through contributions from businesses and individuals, grants, and special events.
