our all inclusive escorted australia tours include hotel accommodations, meals, sightseeing, and transportation. we also include trips into the outback to stand in awe at the striking color changes of ayers rock at twilight, or admire the mystical domes of the olgas. discover an underwater world teeming with colorful wildlife on the great barrier reef and be amazed by this unique natural wonder. venture south to the great ocean road to see the majestic limestone pillars of the twelve apostles jutting out of the sea.  or take an excursion to witness the famous mighty parade of little penguins on phillip island.
guided australia tour packages
 on any of the guided australia tour packages 2023 below, you'll find that australia's cities are just as captivating. sydney beckons with world-famous landmarks like the opera house and harbor bridge as well as natural treasures like the beautiful harbor itself and magnificent surf beaches. cuddle a koala, shop till you drop, dine in style or lose yourself in the city's art galleries, museums and theaters.  cosmopolitan melbourne has a distinctive charm all of its own, with it multicultural cuisines, designer fashions, thriving arts community and rich colonial history.
when is the best time to take an escorted australia tour?
when researching 2023 & 2024 guided australia tour packages, it's important to know that the seasons may stand opposite to yours, so for example, between december and february is summer in australia. the winter there is from june through august but is usually mild. lots of people like to avoid the heat and go in the aussie winter. we like september, october and march for milder temperatures.

we cannot begin to say what an excellent job that our travel agent, cheryl has always done for us, she consistently does an outstanding job. we are not seasoned travelers and she has always been very patient with us. when we inquire about anything her response is both rapid and fitting. if we were to able to travel more she would be our first choice to utilize due to her fine attitude and talent.
