q: what separates von der haus gill german shepherds from the average breeder?
a: we are different because we are the premier german shepherd breeder in the united states if not all north america. we have bred 198+ litters of german shepherds dogs since 1992. we have had  1098+ puppies and over 4000 adult dogs. we have over 38 years in the breeding training business. this is what we do, it’s not a hobby or a part time thing. we do this everyday 7 days a week 365 days a year we are breeding and training german shepherds. we invest in only directly imported, hand picked breeding dogs from germany. we never short cut, buy local dogs, hold dogs back because it’s cheaper. it’s all about quality and breeding the best dogs possible. not making the most money like most so called breeders.
breeding is not a part time hobby, it is a passion, it’s a commitment, it’s a life! that is what von der haus gill is.( from the house of gill’s german shepherds )
