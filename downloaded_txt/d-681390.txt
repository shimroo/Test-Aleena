criss cross jazz








	welcome to the official criss cross jazz website!
      

	based in the provincial city of enschede, in the eastern netherlands,
	criss cross records captured the aesthetic essence of cutting-edge hardcore
	new york jazz more consistently than any other label on 400+ albums recorded
	between 1981 and 2019.
	founder gerry teekens (1935-2019), a linguistics professor by day and a
	semi-professional drummer by night, was a connoisseur of groove -- he operated
	by the motto, âif you have a great band, but not a great drummer, forget it.â

        april 2025 new release
      

        on april 25, 2025 we are releasing
        live at the village vanguard (criss 1424)
        by bill stewart.
      

	âi sat very near to or next to the greats at the village vanguard
	on many occasions,â says the eminent drummer-composer-bandleader
	bill stewart, by way of contextualizing his
	- and the criss cross labelâs â
	first-ever live-at-the-vanguard recording.
	during his early years in
	new york, before he ever played the hallowed basement, stewart, now 58,
	frequently arrived early to claim the behind-the-drumkit position on
	the red banquette that runs along the vanguardâs west wall all the way
	to bandstand stage right to get a birdâs eye view of elvin jones, tony
	williams, roy haynes, billy higgins, and a host of other masters whose
	recordings heâd played along with as an adolescent and teenage
	aspirant in des moines, iowa.
      

	âwhen you sit close, you get the body language, the whole
	vibe of the drummer who you want to check out,â stewart says. âthatâs
	the place.â
      

	itâs a sure bet that more than a few drum aspirants took pains to assess
	stewartâs vibe from that privileged perch between september 18 and september 23
	in 2023, when he convened bassist larry grenadier and
	tenor saxophonist walter smith iii for their third week-long trio
	engagement at the vanguard, following residencies in april 2017 and in october 2018.

	april 2025 vinyl release of gregory groover jr.
      

	on april 25, 2025 we are also releasing
	lovabye (criss 1419)
	by gregory groover jr. on vinyl.
      

gregory grooverâs criss cross debut, recorded on
	the boston born-and-bred tenor saxophonistâs thirtieth birthday, is a tour de force.
	joined by a bespoke sextet of his favorite players, all new york-based,
	groover presents a recital of 11 original tone-parallels to family and friends,
	his intentions anticipated, illuminated and fulfilled by his gifted bandmates.
      

	during the lockdown, groover had generated a group of âlove songs and
	songs of people i love.â in spring 2023, he brought this music
	to walter smith iii, who groover had idolized as a teenager, and is now his
	friend and colleague at berklee school of music, their mutual alma mater,
	where groover serves as assistant chair of the ensemble department.
	âi told walter iâd like to play with some of my other heroes and peers,â
	groover recalls. âhe said, âwhatâs stopping you? the music is there.â
	luckily for me, everyone who i wanted to record with was available and
	happy to do it.â
      

	the lovabye album was released on cd
       	(criss 1419) in april 2024.
      

	from april 25, 2025 the album will also be available as lp on 180 grams black vinyl with
	gatefold cover, as part of the criss cross jazz vinyl (re-)release plan.

        november 2024 new releases
      

        on november 29, 2024 we are releasing two new albums:
        fun one (criss 1422)
        by oz noy, and
        solid jackson (criss 1423)
        by the m.t.b. collective formed by brad mehldau,
	mark turner and peter bernstein.
      










	some might think that guitarist oz noy,
	a celebrated voice in jazz-fusion over the last quarter century for
	applying his formidable guitar chops to funky rhythms and blues-based
	changes on 13 leader albums and hundreds of plugged-in concert performances,
	is not an obvious fit for criss cross, whose 420+-album catalog
	connects almost exclusively to the various tributaries of the hardcore acoustic jazz river.
      

	noy, 52, begs to differ. âiâve known about criss cross
	since my brother brought home albums when i was a teenager,â
	he says, discussing the back story of his label debut, fun one
	(criss 1422),
	a creative, sophisticated and, shall we say, swinging trio encounter with
	pianist david kikoski,
	bassist james genus and
	drummer clarence penn.
	âi know peter bernsteinâs albums and adam rogersâ albums.
	i love mike morenoâs last album. i know how the albums sound.
	i started to study jazz chords and harmony when i was 13.
	i started making a living playing pop and rock music when i was 15 or 16,
	and for all my years in new york iâve had an electric trio that plays
	groove music mixed with jazz and funk thatâs enabled me to get a record deal
	and make albums.
	but iâve been playing standards and jazz all my life, and probably
	since 2017 with this quartet. iâve just never recorded it.â

	when eminent jazz practitioners with shared histories convene
	in the studio without rehearsal or preparatory gigs, a perfunctory,
	by-the-numbers session is often the outcome. that is decidedly not the
	case on solid jackson
	(criss 1423),
	whose personnel,
	four of whom participated on the well-wrought day-after-christmas of 1994
	criss cross album titled consenting adults
	(criss 1177),
	reside in any hardcore jazz connoisseurâs âtop-fiveâ.
	this second gathering of m.t.b. (titled for the surnames of
	brad mehldau,
	mark turner and
	peter bernstein,
	and to signify upon the late â80s âyoung lionâ band otb) is an intense,
	focused recital that reinforces the exalted position each member holds
	in the 2024 jazz landscape. everyone listens.
	no one overplays or goes for âhouse.â
	the ambiance is one of concentrated excellence.
      

consenting adults
	(criss 1177)
	wasnât released until 2000, six years after it was made.
	in the liner notes the protagonists
	(larry grenadier, then and now, played bass;
	leon parker, the drummer in 1994, gives way to
	 bill stewart) were described as
	âelite young improvisers who will be among the movers and shakers of
	21st century jazz at the conclusion of their postgraduate education.â

        july 2024 new release
      

        on july 12, 2024 we are releasing
        painter of dreams (criss 1421)
        by misha tsiganov.
      

        âevery record is a bit different,â misha tsiganov noted at the
        end of the liner notes for mishaâs wishes, his fourth
        criss cross album (criss 1409),
       	on which, for the first time on criss cross,
        he played primarily his original compositions and plugged in on the fender rhodes.
      

        like its predecessor, painter of dreams features two
        highly reworked standards along with six recent melody-forward compositions,
        to which tsiganov applies his signature blend of radical reharmonization,
        mixed meters, shifting tempos, and changing keys.
        otherwise, this ambitious recital documents several âfirsts.â
        for one thing, tsiganov expands beyond the saxophone-trumpet-
        piano-bass-drums format, scoring five of the eight selections for
        either three or four horns. for another, he broadens his tonal palette
        beyond the almost entirely acoustic soundscape of his prior criss
        cross oeuvre, liberally weaving the rhodes and minimoog into the
        flow, as well as the preternaturally flexible voice of hiske oosterwijk,
        who also contributes two lyrics. also, for the first time as a leader,
        tsiganov augments the luminous trumpeter-flugelhornist (and 13-time
        criss cross leader) alex sipiagin on the front line with alto sax titan
        miguel zenón, who plays for the entirety of the proceedings, and â on
        three pieces â the transcendent chris potter on tenor and soprano
        saxophones.
      

        âthe earlier records had different songs and moods, but the
        same sound â trumpet-saxophone-piano-bass-drums,â tsiganov says.
        âi wanted a totally different color.â while working on the repertoire,
        he drew on information accrued in arranging courses with michael
        mossman at queens college, where he earned a masters in 2019.
        âthat opened the gate of big band music for me,â tsiganov says.

        june 2024 new release
      

        on june 14, 2024 we are releasing
        tributes (criss 1420)
        by antonio faraò.
      

	âiâm proud to be part of criss crossâ, antonio faraò
	says of his maiden voyage for the label. for the occasion, which
	transpired in meudon studios in paris in july 2023, the milan-based
	pianist, then 58, convened an equivalently virtuosic trio comprising
	bassist john patitucci and drummer jeff ballard,
	presented them with eight originals and two standards, and let them loose.
	each member operates at a creative peak on this lyric, kinetic, beautifully
	proportioned 65-minute recital.
      

	titled tributes,
	faraòâs criss cross debut is closer in feel and attitude
	to the albums black inside, thorn
	and next stories, recorded for enja between 1998 and 2001,
	where faraã² joined forces, respectively, with top-of-the-pyramid, new york-seasoned
	masters ira coleman and jeff watts, drew gress and jack dejohnette, and ed howard and gene jackson.
	functioning completely as a peer, he addresses the dialects of his pianistic
	heroes â universal âpostbopâ influences as herbie hancock, chick corea,
	mccoy tyner, keith jarrett, bill evans and kenny kirkland, as well as
	oscar peterson, erroll garner, lennie tristano, and martial solal â on their
	own terms of engagement, with the fluency of a native speaker.
	he assimilates their styles, refracts them into a personal argot,
	alchemizing challenging rhythms and highbrow harmony into graceful melodies.
	he eschews ironic deflection and gratuitous structural complication,
	sustaining an attitude of in-the-moment creation and a fierce will to swing.

        april 2024 new release
      

        on april 26, 2024 we are releasing
        lovabye (criss 1419)
        by gregory groover jr..
      

gregory grooverâs criss cross debut, recorded on
	the boston born-and-bred tenor saxophonistâs thirtieth birthday, is a tour de force.
	joined by a bespoke sextet of his favorite players, all new york-based,
	groover presents a recital of 11 original tone-parallels to family and friends,
	his intentions anticipated, illuminated and fulfilled by his gifted bandmates.
	lovabye follows grooverâs formidable first full-length album.
      

	during the lockdown, groover had generated a group of âlove songs and
	songs of people i love.â in spring 2023, he brought this music
	to walter smith iii, who groover had idolized as a teenager, and is now his
	friend and colleague at berklee school of music, their mutual alma mater,
	where groover serves as assistant chair of the ensemble department.

	luckily for me, everyone who i wanted to record with was available and
	happy to do it.â
      

	âgregâs composing supports how he plays,â smith says. âheâs a
	thematic musician, whose playing very much relates to the song. he plays
	with a lot of energy, and he leads with that. the heart is the most important
	thing â the direction and motion of what he plays is where he really feels.

        march 2024 new release
      

        on march 1, 2024 we are releasing
        the illusion of choice (criss 1418)
        by michael thomas.
      

	âthis was a dream band to write for and play with,â alto
	saxophonist michael thomas says of manuel valera,
	matt brewer and obed calvaire,
	his a-list rhythm section on illusion of choice,
	his criss cross debut, and fourth leader album.
	âthese musicians can play any style and sound like itâs the only thing they play.
	i wanted to explore these different areas and cohere them into an album,
	not sound like tunes stuck together for a cd.
	everything was on the table. i wasnât afraid to develop whatever ideas i came up with,
	and see where they went."
      

	although illusion of choice features an
	assembled-for-the-occasion ensemble rather than the working bands
	documented on his earlier albums, michael thomas, 36,
	considers it "the strongest thing iâve done so far.â
	during the four months preceding the september 2023 recording session,
	thomas generated eight originals tailored to the tonal personalities
	of his protean collaborators.
	they live up to the leaderâs ballyhoo, nailing the shifting meters and
	intervallic challenges of his high-degree-of-difficulty pieces with
	panache and creative spirit.
      

	âi try to give people enough to understand and absorb, but
	not so much as to make them wonder whatâs going on,â thomas says.
	âparticularly with respect to melodies, iâm trying to write tunes that donât
	just sound nice, but facilitate playing and improvising as i want.â
	he adds that, although he plays multiple reeds and woodwinds,
	the alto saxophone is his creative home.
	âalto is where i feel most comfortable, have the most control of my sound,
	and can express myself most easily.â

        november 2023 new release
      

        on november 3, 2023 we are releasing
        most peculiar (criss 1412)
        by the lage lund quartet.
      

        the back story for lage lundâs sixth criss cross
        recording dates to the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, in the spring of 2020.
       	lund â a native of skien, norway whoâd lived in the u.s. since 1995 â had just returned
       	to his homeland with his wife and two daughters, then 5 and 7 years old.
       	with school on hiatus, the family had to improvise an at-home curriculum.
      

        âmy wife and i â mainly my wife â made it up on the fly,â lund recalls three years later
       	via zoom. âone day the theme was learning about elephants, another day it was
       	âancient egyptâ or the âstone ageâ or âtreesâ or âhorsesâ â completely random.â
       	in conjunction with these lessons, lund established a daily ritual whereby he spent
       	an hour or so writing a tune based on the theme du jour, another hour to 90 minutes
       	recording it, and another two hours creating and editing a one-minute video â
       	the better to fit within instagram guidelines â from public domain gifs.
       	over the course of five or six weeks, lund created a playlist of 36 videos,
       	which he uploaded to youtube.
      

        âit was a mental health project,â lund says. âwith touring gone and no one to play with,
       	i wanted to give myself a task and feel at the end of the day iâd done something tangible -
       	i didnât have this song this morning, and now here it is. to pull it off, i dealt with
       	short forms, mostly aaba structure, between 8 and 16 bars. also, for the first time since
       	my early twenties, i had an abundance of time to practice, which allowed me to delve into
       	things â voice leading experiments, for example â that werenât necessarily oriented
       	towards getting ready for the next gig, the next tour, the next recording, but which
       	interest me for the long term. it was a bit like going to an artist retreat or residency.â
      

        fast forward to the fall of 2021: lund was back in the saddle, primarily working with
       	saxophonist melissa aldana, whose 2022 blue note release '12 stars' he co-wrote and produced.
       	soon thereafter, criss cross owner jerry teekens called to ascertain
       	his interest in making another album.
       	for lund, 45 when the most peculiar session transpired in june 2022,
       	the offer was an opportunity to reunite with a band he launched in 2014.
       	pianist sullivan fortner (35) and
       	drummer tyshawn sorey (41),
       	both among the most gifted practitioners ever to improvise on their respective instruments,
       	contributed their unique mojo to lundâs 2019 criss cross release,
       	terrible animals (criss 1402).
        virtuoso bassist matt brewer (39),
       	played on lundâs first leader date (romantic latino for ladies, on a japanese label)
       	in 2006, had lund play guitar on his own criss cross debut
       	mythology (criss 1373),
        and recently played on a lund trio covers recital (with sorey) for another label,
        including four songs by andrew hill.
      

	the album was recorded june 17, 2022 at the samurai hotel recording studio in astoria
	by recording engineer mike marciano. he also did the editing, mixing and mastering at
       	systems two.

        new vinyl release of criss cross jazz on october 13, 2023
      

        on october 13, 2023
        criss cross jazz partner
       	elemental music
        released a special gatefold audiophile vinyl version of the classic criss cross jazz album:
	blues for a reason (criss 1010)
       	by chet baker.
      

        it's strange to think that two of the greatest stars of "cool jazz",
        chet baker and warne marsh,
        would never record together, given that they were nearly the same age,
        and that they both rose to fame in los angeles around the same period.
        however, that would have been the case if gerry teekens, founder of the
        criss cross label, had never had the bright idea of
        bringing them together in 1984.
        surprisingly, they would end up cutting their only collaborative album
       	in monster, the netherlands!
      

        this is the seventh release by elemental music of a classic criss cross jazz
       	album on vinyl, under license from criss cross jazz.

        september 2023 new release
      

        on september 29, 2023 we are releasing
        over here (criss 1417)
        by the jim rotondi quintet.
      

	by titling his eighth criss cross album over here,
	trumpeter jim rotondi picks up on the sentiments he signified with
	the move (criss 1323),
	his seventh for the label.
	âit doesnât necessarily mean moving somewhere else, but rather returning home,
	playing tunes with a lot of straight-ahead swing and interesting chord sequences
	with guys iâm comfortable with,â rotondi stated in the liner notes i wrote for
	that kinetic 2009 recital.
      

	thatâs an effective description of what transpires on rotondiâs latest swinging affair.
	but although he wasnât misdirecting, he wasnât telling the whole story.
	as it turned out, the move indeed foreshadowed rotondiâs
	decision in 2010 to leave new york for austria for a position as professor of trumpet
	at the university of graz. as indicated by the current title (which references
	george m.  cohanâs 1917 flagwaver âover thereâ and rotondiâs fatherâs service in europe
	during world war 2), rotondi is ensconced on the continent thirteen years later,
	augmenting pedagogical responsibilities with several trips a year to new york
	and other u.s. waystations, and also touring the jazz clubs of central europe,
	italy, france, spain and the u.k.
      

	in fact, over here stems from a ten-day sojourn by a band of
	four new york-trained masters that opened with a jazz cellar gig in the viennese
	suburb bruck an der leitha, proceeded to neuberg, germany, doubled back to viennaâs
	prestigious porgy and bess club, continued with a drive to tenor saxophone maestro
	piero odoriciâs club in bologna, and then transitioned to udine for the recording session.
      

	the tour gestated from rotondiâs desire to create a european group with
	tenor saxophonist rick margitza, based in paris since 2003,
	as his front line counterpart, and pianist danny grissett,
	a five-time criss cross leader whoâs resided in vienna
	since january 2013. âiâve known rick virtually since i moved to new york in 1987,â
	the 60-year-old master recalls. âweâve played many sessions together, but never
	a gig, and i thought it was time for us to do something."
      

	the album was recorded may 10, 2023 at the artesuono recording studio in udine (italy).
       	recording engineer mike marciano did the editing, mixing and mastering at systems two.

        new vinyl release of criss cross jazz on september 15, 2023
      

        on september 15, 2023
        criss cross jazz partner
       	elemental music
        released a 2-lp gatefold audiophile vinyl version of the classic criss cross jazz album:
	live at nick's (criss 1027)
       	by chet baker.
      

chet bakerâs relationship with europe was longstanding, and filled
        with periods of mutual admiration and understanding, and others of mere tolerance.
        live at nickâs was recorded in november of 1978.
        however, it wouldnât see the light until 1987, a year before chetâs untimely death.
        it finds the trumpeter in the company of new york-born pianist phil markowitz,
        with whom he had started working in february of that same year.
        he toured europe with chet in 1978 and 1979 and recorded with him for the last time at
        new yorkâs fat tuesdayâs in 1981.
      

        this is the sixth release by elemental music of a classic criss cross jazz

        august 2023 vinyl release of mike moreno
      

	like a well â wrought character in a hollywood movie,
	standards from film, guitarist mike morenoâs
	fourth criss cross album, exists atop a solid, cogent back story.
	recorded in december 2021, when the world and new york city â houston-born morenoâs
	home for more than two decades â were no longer on covid lockdown, it documents the
	leaderâs exhaustive investigations into the provenance of ten iconic standards that,
	as he puts it, âare the summer jazz workshop tunesâ â they say you have to learn
	these songs if you want to be a jazz musician. you learn them very young or in the
	beginning days of your journey into this music.
      

	the standards from film album was released on cd
       	(criss 1410) in october 2022.
      

	from august 18, 2023 the album will also be available as a 2-lp set on 180 grams black vinyl with
	gatefold cover, as part of the criss cross jazz vinyl (re-)release plan.
      

	joined by a rhythm section of generational contemporaries,
	each at the top of the jazz pyramid,
	(sullivan fortner, piano;
	matt brewer, bass;
	obed calvaire, drums)
	moreno deploys a variety of attacks and tonalities to
	create dynamic tension in lyric declamations that he delivers with his
	signature plush, resonant tone, sublime articulation, and harmonic intelligence.

        july 2023 vinyl release of lage lund
      

terrible animals is perhaps the most compositionally ambitious and
	daringly performed of lage lund's five albums on criss cross jazz.
	the terrible animals album was released on cd
       	(criss 1402) in february 2019.
      

	from july 14, 2023 the album will also be available as a 2-lp set on 180 grams black vinyl with
       	gatefold cover, as part of the criss cross jazz vinyl (re-)release plan.
      

        joined by a never-before-convened, top-of-the-pyramid rhythm section
	(sullivan fortner, piano;
	larry grenadier, bass;
	tyshawn sorey, drums)
	the 39-year-old presents ten far-flung originals that elicit the
	full measure of their creativity over the 68-minute program,
	spurring lund -- who makes ingenious use of effects within his flow --
	to some of his most dynamic and varied playing on record.

        june 2023 new release
      

        on june 30, 2023 we are releasing
        vessel (criss 1416)
        by the manuel valera quintet.
      

manuel valera advises his students at new york university to
	write music every day.
	âi tell them that composition is essentially another instrument â
	the more you practice, the better you get at it,â
	says the 42-year-old piano master, who, by his count, has generated
	some 200 recorded pieces since he entered the fray in the early aughts.
      

vessel, valeraâs second album for criss cross,
	showcases eight recent works, each âhonoring a different person whoâs influenced my music.â
	valera made it in january 2023, nine years after presenting another eight originals on
	in motion (criss 1372)
	which featured a slamming iteration of his new cuban express ensemble,
	whose eponymous first cd had earned a 2013 grammy nomination for âbest latin jazz album.â
	the pieces on that straight-eighth oriented session mixed elements from various
	afro-cuban dialects with postbop, fusion jazz, funk and r&b, incorporating
	intricate beat modulation, odd meters, and intriguing ensemble color.
      

	on in motion, as on most of his 16 albums since 2004,
	valera established the compositions as âthe complete framework for the improvisations â
	although the solos, of course, are also important.â
	but here, as indicated by the title, valera diverges, constructing pieces that are
	âvessels for improvising, like they wrote them on the old blue note records.
	you play the tune, you blow over the tune, then you play the tune again â
	the improvisation is as important as the composition. a lot is going on, but
	thereâs still that connection to the older tunes â and a couple sound like
	they could have been from way back.â
      

	the album was recorded january 26, 2023 at the samurai hotel recording studio in ny.
	recording engineer mike marciano also did the editing, mixing and mastering at systems two.

        may 2023 new release
      

        on may 26, 2023 we are releasing
        blues for gerry (criss 1415)
        by the david hazeltine trio.
      

        pianist david hazeltine has a history with criss cross.
        to be specific, between 1995 and 2010, gerry teekens, the labelâs founder,
        presented eight albums on which hazeltine led trios, quartets and quintets
        featuring his impeccable, individualistic pianism, original compositions and arrangements;
        another five with the cooperative all-star sextet one for all
        (tenor saxophonist eric alexander, trombonist steve davis, trumpeter jim rotondi,
        bassists peter washington or john webber, and drummer joe farnsworth),
        whose grooving, harmonically acute charts bear his stamp;
        and another 17 as a sideman with the aforementioned luminaries,
        trumpeter brian lynch, alto saxophonist jim snidero, and other high-level jazzfolk
        who now hold pride of place in the hardcore jazz ecosystem.
      


        hazeltine returns to the fold with blues for gerry,
        his first criss cross leader date since
        inversions (2010, criss 1326),
        a lovely quintet date that included alexander and vibraphonist steve nelson.
        recorded in a single six-hour session on december 1, 2022,
        itâs his third state of the art trio recital for criss cross
        with modern masters peter washington and joe farnsworth,
        following the equally accomplished
        perambulation (2005, criss 1276) and
        close to you (2003, criss 1247).
      

        gerry senior liked those albums, and his son jerry teekens, jr.  asked me
       	if iâd put together that same trio,â hazeltine said in march, a day after
        returning from a 20-day tour of primarily one-nighters in europe with drummer
        bernd reiter and bassist aldo zunino.
        âi have fond memories of working for gerry. he was a pretty hands-off producer,
        and let me do what i wanted. his one request was always, âthereâs got to be a blues;
        itâs not swinging if thereâs no blues.â so i wrote blues for gerry.â
      
	the album was recorded december 22, 2022 at the samurai hotel recording studio in ny.
	recording engineer mike marciano also did the editing, mixing and mastering at systems two.

        two new vinyl releases of criss cross jazz on march 17, 2023
      

        on march 17, 2023 
        criss cross jazz partner
       	elemental music
        is releasing audiophile vinyl versions of two classic 1997/1998
       	criss cross jazz albums:
	all through the night (criss 1153)
       	by bill charlap, and
	intuition (criss 1160)
       	by kurt rosenwinkel.
      

all through the night is one of the most acclaimed trio albums
        by new york city-born pianist bill charlap.
        charlap is widely known for his work on the blue note and venus labels,
        and his 2016 album with tony bennett,
        the silver lining, the songs of jerome kern,
        won the award for best traditional pop vocal album in the 58th annual grammy awards.
        jazz critic scott yanow granted all through the night
        four out of five stars on allmusic, stating that,
        âthis trio outing by pianist bill charlap with peter and kenny washington
        is a superior modern mainstream set. an enjoyable outing.â
      

        this is the fourth release by elemental music of a classic criss cross jazz
       	album on vinyl, under license from criss cross jazz.

        philadelphia-born guitarist kurt rosenwinkel is best known
        for his multiple recordings on the verve label.
        his 1998 lp intuit marked his second album as a leader and
        the only one he recorded for the criss cross label.
        a quartet session devoted entirely to standards, it reveals the depth of
        the guitaristâs expertise in the bop idiom.
        he is backed by pianist michael kanan,
        bassist joe martin,
        and drummer tim pleasant.
        his interaction with them fore-shadows rosenwinkelâs later attempts
        to blur the boundary between standard and original repertoire.
      

        this is the fifth release by elemental music of a classic criss cross jazz
       	album on vinyl, under license from criss cross jazz.

        january 2023 new release #1
      

        on january 6, 2023 we are releasing
        blues variant (criss 1413)
        by michael feinberg.
      

        an intriguing element of michael feinbergâs superb
	criss cross debut is that the leader could easily
	have titled it âbassist in the backgroundâ (fans of duke ellingtonâs
	wonderful 1960 lp "pianist in the background" will know what i mean).
	throughout blues variant â which includes
	six tunefully percolating originals by feinberg,
	one by tenor saxophonist noah preminger,
	and one by pianist leo genovese â
	the 35-year-old bass maestro hews to the mantra,
	âif you want to hear me solo, come to a gig, where i often play a solo on every tuneâ.
      

	the album was recorded january 17, 2022 at the samurai hotel recording studio in ny.
	recording engineer mike marciano also did the editing, mixing and mastering at systems two in ny.

        january 2023 new release #2
      

        on january 27, 2023 we are releasing
        mel's vision (criss 1414)
        by the alex sipiagin quintet.
      

        since he emigrated to the united states from russia in 1991,
	alex sipiagin has earned an exalted international reputation
	as a no-technical-limits improvisor, sustaining a gorgeous sound throughout
	the trumpetâs registral range, navigating harmonic and rhythmic complexity
	with precision, passion, and abiding lyricism.
	most of sipiaginâs 12 previous albums for criss cross also
	showcase his contrapuntal, harmonically comprehensive compositions,
	full of interesting melodic twists and turns.
	on them, he projects the same voice that he improvises with
	but written out for more instruments.
      

	for his 13th criss cross date,
       	melâs vision, the 55-year-old master â
	joined by a-listers tenor saxophonist chris potter,
	pianist david kikoski,,
	bassist matt brewer
	and drummer johnathan blake â
	contributes two wonderful originials.
	but alex addresses the session primarily as an opportunity to focus on
	interpreting music by others â a song by potter, a ukrainian folk song
	and four rarely covered gems from the jazz canon.
      

	the album was recorded april 22, 2022 at the samurai hotel recording studio in ny.
	recording engineer mike marciano also did the editing, mixing and mastering at systems two in ny.
