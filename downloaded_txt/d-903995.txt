bible study
 buts of the bible: biblical characters and the crossroads of life  â  now available  â the study is designed to provide churches and individuals with an additional resource for in-depth, life-application study of godâs word.
the buts of the bible is an additional discipleship tool that is separate from the other bcf training levels. it focuses on biblical characters from both the old and new testaments, looking at their circumstances, struggles, temptations, spiritual defeats and victories.  as you study these characters, you will see that the word translated âbutâ (or word with similar meaning) often represents a turning point or decision point in their lives; and you will see how lessons from these characters are remarkably relevant to our lives here in the 21st century. a sample lesson is available as a free download, and a free downloadable leaderâs guide is available with the purchase of a study booklet.
