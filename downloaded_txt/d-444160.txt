manna homeowner spotlight












dear friends,

in 2023, shari moore went through a rigorous process of applying to several different housing programs (hpap, eahp, & heahp), including securing private closing cost assistance through manna. a long-process that culminated in ms. shari moore successfully becoming a first-time homeowner after living 52 years in the same apartment in d.c. “when i went to closing and got the keys to my new home, i can’t even express the feeling of joy, happiness, and satisfaction that i felt when those keys were put in my hands. it made me realize that i was finally a homeowner. the biggest change for me is the feeling of gratitude and my sense of accomplishment. now after 52 years of living in the same apartment i was raised in, i am able to come to my own home every day and enjoy the reward of my hard work.” — shari moorein 2023 manna has been able to assist 24 clients to become first-time homeowners-clients whose lives share some of the same struggles and challenges as ms. shari moore. click to learn more about our resources.

find support

“i wanted to purchase a home, but i needed to get my credit in order,” walls said. “i had tried other programs, but they didn’t provide as much support as manna did. manna provides you with the tools and education to get yourself ready. the other programs i tried would help you, but you had to have your stuff together already.”  at the time, sabrina and her son were living with her mother while trying to get all the knowledge, funding, and paperwork together necessary for her to get on track to become a homeowner.

creating pathways to equitable, safe, affordable, and sustainable housing for all.

“having the opportunity to build multigenerational family wealth feels wonderful. i’m talking to my kids ad grandkids abut homeownership now so they an become homebuyers when they’re older and be prepared to hold onto this house as an investment for years to come” - russian godwin, first-time manna homeowner.read all about manna’s work in manna’s latest ‘annual impact report’ that showcases all of the challenges we face in developing affordable housing and the impact we’re having in the communities we serve.

knowledge is opportunity is power

“there are so many things you have to do to get to go through the process,” sabrina said. “i didn’t know all that (was involved). i enjoyed learning about the whole homebuying process and having somebody there that, if you have questions, you could go back to the homebuyers club. they were there to walk through the whole process with me.”the process that sabrina describes is not an unfamiliar one to many low- to moderate- income residents in the nation’s capital, one of the united states highest cost of living cities. although sabrina walls has achieved her dream of becoming a homeowner in the dc, the city she grew up in, it was a dream that involved overcoming numerous obstacles, and challenges over 10 years to achieve.
