spiral on... homeworld 
                 was recorded when neptune went into aquarius in 1998 with some amazing austin musicians:
steve bernal 
                 (bass) & 
                 aaron morgan brown (drums) 
                   then in 9/9/09 it was planned to release it on 10/10/10.

for the 10/10/10 release party 
                       aliah spontaneously  gave a cocreative healing session with the form she's developed:
aromatone qi gong 
                         ("spiral touch" technique)
                         using  aromatherapy, 
                         sound healing,
                         & medical qi gong
                         (www.cocreative.us) 
                         the session was  done
                         to the new cd   in a
                         yogadance qi flow of healing.

            sacred jam with 
steve bernal
            (bass)
brad evilsizer
            (drums)

and the cd release was 11/11/11. 

so what does 11/11/11 
                    mean to you?
a great opening... some have said... it adds up to the number 33 (the
christ consciousness number) - the age when jesus reached enlightenment

                    many mystics say.

the arrow is pointing on the cd
              to the galactic center.
              this is approximately where we are now in the milky way galaxy.
at the same time pluto is closest to the sun (and us) in the eliptical
orbit it is moving. the 2 have not happened at the same time for a very
long time... (5125 years) and this is the
meaning of the mayan calendar. 

              mayan elder says: 
"12/22 - something will change 
with the sun... take time to meditate & pray with the sun now
and ask to be much better."
              at the shift: 
              12/21 have a prayerful 
              ceremony among friends. 

              humanity is about to enter the 
              temple of grace... where all is forgiven in the light of what we face together. it is time to come together in peace.
                it is not the end of the world... it is the end of the world as we know it. 
                (thanks rem)

                it is time for us to cocreate the alternative life affirming, wholistic, 
                joyful, sustainable,
                earth-friendly,
                wellness lifestyles to allow
                for a new way of life that is healthier for us  all and those who we are here to care for - on  our  homeworld - it's time to spiral on... (more) 

sitar was just added to the 
              we here now cd by 
alan sitar brown who also added a sitar track to
