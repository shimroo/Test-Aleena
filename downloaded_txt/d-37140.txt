intactivism
                pages



the struggle for genital autonomy
                  and against the involuntary genital modification 
                  of children of any sex:
male genital cutting
                  female genital cutting
                  involuntary sex reassignment
 genital autonomy for all!

 








this
                    site supports the beyond the bris
statement against antisemitism








this site differs from others opposed to genital mutilation: its
              focus is on intactness rather than on genital cutting. it is intended to
              counteract the mindset that the foreskin is an "extra" "flap of
              skin" -



 - and that male genital cutting is the norm, and the
              corresponding mindsets that lead to the cutting of girls and
              intersex people.

a gallery of intact men and their penises 
              a gallery of intact men and their penises in
                art.  countries that celebrate
                the (intact) penis. the "luscious
                beauty" of the intact male.
for intact (young us) men who worry about being "different," a
              gallery of intact celebrities (with
              their clothes on): a page each of intact historical
                personages, us film stars former
              and current, us tv stars former
              and current, us
                sporting heroes, us musicians,
              non-us celebrities (musicians, actors,
              sportsmen and others), and leaders.
            
a gallery of very-probably-intact men.



structure 
a glossary of words relating to
              intactivism and normal anatomy. some of the main ones are illustrated.

              structure.
not "just a flap of skin": a non-erotic animation of how
                  a foreskin works.  a more stylised animation to
              demonstrate its size. a
              remarkable illustration of its
                actual size.

human rights


 genital integrity is first and foremost a human
                  rights issue. 
ethics


 medical organisations
                have very little to say about the ethics
                  of genital cutting. there is more here.

 the british medical association has issued ethical
                  guidelines that rule out infant genital cutting based on
                parental preference alone.

 an important book, "the ethical canary", includes
                a chapter on the ethics of male genital
                  cutting.


 two ethicists defend male genital cutting and
              attack their critics using flawed arguments. here is a
                rebuttal. 
the chair of the aap bioethics
              committee shows that parental consent is inadequate for
            unnecessary surgery. 

law
              the legal case against infant male
                genital cutting is growing. this section also contrasts the
              protection afforded cats, dogs and a baby's head against similar
              procedures.

a shocking parallel. parental
              guidance recommended.

rebuttals

the case presented for circumcision is hydra-headed:
                        answer one argument and its supporters will produce
                        another, and another, indefinitely. (urinary
                          tract infections, until recently cited as the main
                        reason to circumcise, were only added to the list in 1982)
                        something else is going on--if the foreskin has so many
                        faults and varied, how could it ever have have survived?

                        it is a step backward from the 2010
                          policy, which disposes of the medical claims,
