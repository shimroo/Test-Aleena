tidewater history
in 2006 tidewater boats began with a dream. with decades of marine craftsmanship and knowledge, we set out to create the best boat value for the money. twelve years later tidewater has developed into one of the fastest growing, most popular saltwater boats in the industry. born in the midlands of south carolina where marine craftsmanship is a staple of the economy, tidewater has historically utilized the best materials and the skilled labor to produce a boat worthy of proud ownership.






why go-devil?
experience like no other
why go-devil? because with nearly 40 years of experience with the go-devil, we possess knowledge that no one else can duplicate. every nut, bolt and weld is in place as a result of years of testing and use in real situations. our engines are designed for and tested in the harshest shallow water environments that we can find. the benefit of 35 years of experience accompanies each product that leaves our shop. it is that experience that allows us to continue to produce the best products available to outdoorsmen, and that experience that gives us the ability to care for your with customer service that is second to none!
