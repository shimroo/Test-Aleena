a suitable size (e.g. if you wanted it life-size).i know you do pet portraits from photos but how many photos do you need to work from?for my pet portraits i work from one photo.  this photo of your dog, cat, horse or any other animal needs to be one that you love and say “this is typically her/him”.  other photos are helpful for colouring and for me to see character, but not necessary if you don’t have them.  see my pet portraits photo advice page to help you with taking your photos of your pet or pets.  if you are local to me, i can come and take your photos for you!i don’t live in the
