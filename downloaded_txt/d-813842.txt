this past winter i stored my catalina 42 sailboat on the hard at worton creek marina. this was my first winter there. i couldn’t have been more pleased with the service there. they were organized from day 1. they store your boat orderly and systematically in the order that you will go back in the water in the spring.

i have had all my service and repair work for both my 50 post and now 61 viking handled by the skilled crew at worton creek marina for over 9 years. i may easily be among their most picky customers and have to say they offer nothing but top-notch repairs and workmanship with old fashioned honesty and integrity. friendly people who are knowledgeable, care and are easy to work with.
