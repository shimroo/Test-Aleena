twirly skirt



the preschool peanut has been looking forward to wearing this skirt ever since i showed her the pattern and then let her help me pick out the colors. it's such a simple design, definitely easy for a beginner knitter to follow. as soon as she put it on today, she started shimmying and twirling like crazy. turned a very grumpy day into a happy and sweet one.barefoot knits twirly skirtcotton fleece: cottonball, pink-a-boo, begonia passion, and perry's primrosesize 4 with size 6 length for room to growraveled here

lisa's triumph



shedir by jenna wilson, knitty.comrowan calmer in #475 tinkerbell, one ballus3 needleraveled hereso an old friend of mine dropped a bomb on us all when she told us that she has breast cancer. this is a friend that i've known for years; she's the big sis of a friend i made in junior high school. this is a friend that would do anything for you and for whom we are all doing anything we can.when she asked me to accompany her on a wig fitting appointment, i was beyond honored that she would consider me for that important task! we had fun, trying out wigs of impossible colors and shapes (on purpose, of course) until we found the one! the color is just right and if you didn't know her, you'd think she had a really cute haircut.she tried on a few hats and scarves, too, but since she hadn't yet started chemo, she had a full head of hair and was having a hard time imagining what it will all look like when it's gone. but i knew i had to make something for her. you do what you know, and i know how to knit. this hat has eleventy billion cable crosses but with each row i checked off i envisioned taking steps toward her health and the end of her treatment. i gave my friend her hat last night when she invited me to another appointment she had. lots of laughs together, lots of love, and lots of strength within our network of friends and family. she started chemo about a week ago and has the most amazing outlook, savoring each day as a gift. i hope this hat will be like a hug on chilly days and give her strength to kick cancer's butt!

onion dill bread



recent tweets about bread machine baking reminded me of the one i have buried deep, deep in the pantry. an old boyfriend gave it to me about a century ago. i loved the smell of the fresh bread baking and i don't remember why i let it sit so long... possibly because it only makes little one pound cubes of bread that are gone before you can even bake another one? i pulled it out last night, along with my copy of the bread machine baker by elizabeth harbison (great book for me because all of these recipes yield 1 lb.), and threw together some onion dill bread. mmmm. mmmm. m. my girl loves helping in the kitchen and liked seeing the machine do all the stirring for us.onion dill bread"this is a delicious "eat it hot out of the bread machine" bread. it doesn't even need butter. i have had success substituting yogurt for the sour cream for a lower-calorie treat."2 t or 1/2 package of yeast2 c bread flour1/4 t baking soda1 t salt1 egg1/4 c water1/2 c cottage cheese1/2 c sour cream2 t sugar2 t minced dried onion1 t + 1 t dried dill seed (i suspect this is a typo for dill weed)1 t butterin a warm saucepan, combine water, cottage cheese, sour cream, sugar, onion, dill and butter, until melted.add all the ingredients to the machine in the order listed. choose either regular or light crust (depending on your preference) and push "start."

tap tap tap... this thing still on?



i was lucky to meet the beautiful, talented, and funny superstarra christie last week when she visited seattle and that reminded me that i have a blog! oh yeah! that's how christie and i started corresponding, lo these many years ago. i think i'll just look back in my projects and blog those things i've finished, in order to catch up a bit. if you're still reading, thank you! it seems that ravelry, facebook, twitter, and life all take time away from blogging and reading blogs. but someone reminded me that i was on that fateful list (whatever happened to the knit blog class of 2005?) and here i am!last year i made three dolores park cowls for my dear friends. this pattern is genius in its simplicity and that is why a gazillion people have made them... i renamed the cowls for parks in my friends' neighborhoods...clockwise from left, malabrigo chunky:- pagoda, became the friendly park cowl- saphire green, became the highland park cowl- velvet grapes, still sitting in my stash, waiting to become my cowl!- tortuga, became the steilacoom park cowlhere is kristina modeling her own cowl in saphire green:

happy new year!



highlights of 2008: the peanut turned two in june, and is now "two and a half old". she visited santa claus this year and it was one of the most precious moments of her little life so far. she is such a joy! ... and feisty... :)the day after her birthday party, i completed my first (half) marathon, the seafair marathon. here i am coming across the finish line with my dear friend tina. never thought i'd do that...i was featured on seattle's child magazine, worked toward and achieved (shut up!) national board certification. never thought i'd do that, either. :)visited nyc in november with the mr. it had been a long time. got to visit with my dear friend debbie; she was one of my travel friends when i was in india. went to a show at the village vanguard. ate the most incredible pastrami at katz's.and who will ever forget where they were on election night 08? what a year, what a year!i'm incredibly grateful for my friends and family, my home, my work... i wish you all a happy and healthy new year!
