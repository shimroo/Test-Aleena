hello, fellow steamer
			and welcome to jensen steam engine mfg. company's web site... our first venture
			into modern technology. throughout our rich 88 year history,  the "jensen
			steam team" and three generations of out family, 
                                                            have never wavered in our goal to make the finest,
			ready-to-run, stationary model steam engines, steam 
                                                            turbines  & miniature 
                                                            power generating plants
			in the world. our longevity and continued growth attest to meeting these
			challenges. not only are we the last remaining american manufacturer of it's
			kind, but we still use the original tooling, dies and hand craftsmanship
			for which we are known. this attention to quality and detail makes our legendary
			engines highly prized by the hobbyist, student, educator, power plant operator,
			engineer and collector. our solid brass and nickel plated steam engines are
			produced in limited quantities, with prices starting at only $159.95, (far
			less than the imports), yet our quality and power are vastly
			superior.

                                                made it even easier to shop
