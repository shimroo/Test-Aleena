our heritagesegelbåt & motorbåt(sailboat & motorboat)the sea has been a tradition in our family for as long as anyone can remember. whether skippering the old "m" class sloops or heading the rigging gang at luders shipyard,it was something our scandinavian heritage demanded.it's a tradition we still maintain and one we hope has made gunnar, hjalmar and knut proud.our serene setting at the head of protected calves island north on connecticut rivermay be what first attracts you to our yard, but our professional service, well kept facilities and friendly atmosphere will keep you coming back.tusen tack(thousand thanks)
