“joya approaches improvisation as an art form, while using it as a tool for personal growth and exploration.she helps her students work as an ensemble, while holding each of us with great care. she builds on our strengths, while stretching our growing edges. joya’s feedback is compassionate, yet honest, artistically oriented yet psychologically empowering. this is not therapy, but i found the work to be deeply therapeutic. i say, if you have even the tiniest impulse to give joya’s class a try, follow that impulse!” – rosy aronson, expressive arts therapist, artist    













“joya is simply one of the best improvisation instructors around. if you are stuck in your head when onstage and find yourself limited in your capacity to trust your instincts, joya can help you get past the inner critic that is getting in your way. in my years of studying the craft i have never worked with anyone who has had such a profound impact on me and who contributed as much to my success as a performer. i can not recommend her enough.” – dwayne mcdaniel, improvisor & producer with endgames, sfbarprov and other san francisco institutions.    “after twenty years in the darkness away from acting, joya cory coaxed me back into the light with these kind words, “just try it. what could it hurt?” joya’s genius is in her openness and love of exploration. she reintroduced me to the fun of being on stage and after that, pointed the light in the direction of a life in theater. i moved to new york and was eventually awarded a 2006 new york innovative theater award nomination for best actor. i have signed with a manager. i’m involved in projects i never thought possible. and i have never been happier. all of this opportunity would not have happened without joya’s belief, her trust, her encouragement. “just try it. “ – jess draper, actor, new york
