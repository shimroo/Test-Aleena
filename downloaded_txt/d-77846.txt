clinical and basic research studies --  we are actively recruiting participants for several research studies described on this site and we hope that you will consider participating.
          these studies are designed to advance our understanding of pituitary disorders and improve treatment for pituitary patients.

patients may qualify for research studies in the neuroendocrine and pituitary tumor clinical center.  we are currently accepting patients for screening to determine study eligibility.
depending on the study, subjects may receive free testing, medication and/or stipends.



→ research studies


patient education -- there is a wealth of information designed for patients about pituitary disease on this website, on the pituitary society website  and in the neuroendocrine and pituitary tumor clinical center bulletins.

for a video of our acromegaly patient day. check back here for announcements of future workshops.

physician education -- 

the mgh/harvard medical school postgraduate course clinical endocrinology is held annually in boston and includes a full day on pituitary topics.
the neuroendocrine and pituitary tumor clinical center bulletin provides updates on pituitary disease topics.

treatment of pituitary disorders






→ pituitary tumors
the pituitary gland secretes a number of hormones that control many of the endocrine functions of the body. it secretes prolactin, which stimulates mild production after pregnancy; acth (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) controls cortisol production by the adrenal glands; tsh (thyroid stimulating hormone) stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones; gh (growth hormone) is important for normal growth and bone development and for maintaining bone and muscle mass in adults. 
pituitary tumors can be either secretory (secreting excessive pituitary hormones) or non-functioning (non-secreting). large tumors, whether secretory or non-functioning, can cause visual loss from pressure on the optic nerves or chiasm, headaches and/or hormone deficiencies from damage to the normal pituitary gland.
                  there are a number of syndromes associated with excess hormone secretion, including:
                  
acromegaly
cushing's disease
prolactinoma
tsh adenomas


                  there are also a number of tumors, cysts and other disorders in the pituitary gland area that do not secrete hormones but may need to be treated. these include:
                  
non-functioning pituitary adenomas
pituitary cysts (rathke cleft cysts, arachnoid cysts)
craniopharyngiomas
inflammatory disorders (sarcoid, lymphocytic hypophysitis and others)


prolactinomas (excess prolactin secretion) can cause amenorrhea (loss of menstrual periods) and galactorrhea (breast milk production) in women, and low testosterone in men with loss of libido (sex drive) and erectile dysfunction. first line of treatment is usually medication.

minimally invasive surgery






→ pituitary surgery
when surgery is necessary, most pituitary tumors can be removed through a transsphenoidal approach. a small incision is made in the back of the nasal passage, into the patient's sphenoid sinus.  the pituitary gland sits in a bony cavity called the "sella turcica" in the back wall of the sphenoid sinus. this minimally invasive technique, called transsphenoidal surgery, typically helps patient recover from surgery faster.
our surgeons, specializing in minimally invasive transsphenoidal surgery, perform more than 150 transsphenoidal procedures per year.
