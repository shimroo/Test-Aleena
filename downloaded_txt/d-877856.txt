 custom wood carving
to encounter the work of dimitrios klitsas, the master wood carver, is to experience an ancient way of seeing the classical tradition come alive. it is to be surprised by the infinite perspectives generated from within his lifelike renderings of the natural world. these wood carvings retain their ability to delight and amaze even after years of familiarity. dimitrios is steeped in the true classical tradition, applying that art to all styles, producing wood sculpture, hand carved furniture and every type of architectural ornament. he works with patrons to bring to life their own vision for hand carved wood ornament. dimitrios also teaches wood sculpting in his own woodcarving school, thereby maintaining the living, classical tradition for the generations to come.
