the house that we built. after scouring 
            the county for a house suitable to our tastes and finances, we finally 
            settle on building our own.



 
 the detomaso pantera. probably 
            the most affordable, the most accessible, the most personalized and 
            the most fun italian sports car you could ever find.



 
 my 1971 mach i, featuring a 351cleveland 
            powerplant with 4-barrel conventional fuel aspiration, c6 transmission.



 
i've finished the engine rebuild 
            on the mach i. follow my progress as we built the next super engine 
            for this fabulous car. take a look at the parts going into it, see 
            what it all looks like, etc. not all pages are done yet.



 
my 1982 jeep wagoneer limited, with 
            a 1967 amc (kaiser) 327 engine. the engine is a family heirloom, and 
            the body i picked up for a song. see the cool things we did with this, 
            and still got it to pass emissions for a 1982 vehicle.



 
i've written some poetry and short stories. 
            i'm not saying i'm any good at it, but it's a way to express emotions, 
            and create tangible daydreams.



 
read the thoughts that leak out 
            of my head, a window into my soul, or a peephole into my brain, 
            your choice.



 
use my public pgp key, for secure communications 
            and other encryption. includes links to get pgp.
