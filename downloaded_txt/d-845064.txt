                                  trademark teak                              
the art of woodworking
from the beginning, the founder of chris-craft, christopher columbus smith, had a love affair with wood. he instinctively understood how to select and work with it to build the most magnificent boats that graced the seas. his woodworking skills were so well respected that, at that time, lumber yards referred to the highest grades of wood as “chris-craft quality.”

more details




why teak?
there’s nothing like stepping barefoot onto a teak swim platform that’s been soaking in the sun. or looking down a long, teak-covered bow from the captain’s seat, onto an endless sea of water.
part of the appeal and iconic beauty of a chris-craft is our extensive use of hand-selected, solid genuine teak. chosen for its beauty and consistent grain, teak is not just durable under harsh sea and weather conditions, but it’s also forgiving on bare feet, naturally resists slipping, and easy to care for.
all of our inlaid teak is handcrafted and caulked by skilled craftsmen. while other manufacturers use fasteners to apply decking materials, our expert boat builders use epoxy, thereby eliminating fittings that might slowly raise up over time and create an eyesore or tripping hazard. caulking is a time-consuming art, but worth the results. all done by hand, then chiseled off and sanded smooth, it is a labor of love.
how to care for teak.
teak adds a beautiful sensation and naturally resists salt water better than other woods. as such, it requires limited care. teak contains natural oils that prevent it from rotting, even when left unfinished and exposed to the weather. these natural oils and regular cleanings will preserve your decks far into the future.
to clean, rinse your teak decks regularly with fresh water or mild cleansers to remove stains and pollutants. wipe up spills from suntan lotions, motor oils or oily foods as much as possible with a clean rag or paper towel.
when cleaning teak decks, scrub across the grain with a soft plastic-bristle brush. scrubbing with the grain, particularly with a stiff-bristle brush, will take the softwood out of the teak plants and make them ridged, shortening the life of the deck.
there is no need to add coats of teak sealers or oils, other than for the cosmetic appearance. but if you wish to maintain this appearance, use a teak sealer rather than oil. oils darken the wood, making it hotter and more slippery, negating teak's natural non-slip surface.
