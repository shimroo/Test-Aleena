            dying to serve: dozens of recruits have died nationwide while training to become police officers


15 mins ago


at least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade. that's according to an ap investigation based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports. the investigation shows most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise. many deaths occurred on the first day of physical training. others came weeks in, sometimes after drills or timed runs on hot days. experts were surprised by ap’s findings and said many deaths were preventable. no federal agency or outside organization tracks recruit deaths, unlike those of officers. black men comprised nearly 60% of the deaths, while just 12% of local police forces.
