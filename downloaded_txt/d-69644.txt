kellogg community college’s popular soul food luncheon returns to campus wednesday, feb. 19.
this year’s luncheon will run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the binda performing arts center lobby, on campus at 450 north ave. in battle creek. tickets can be purchased in the adjacent kellogg room the day of the event and are $5 for students and $10 for the general public.
note: food for this event does go fast; tickets will be sold until the food is gone, but arriving early is encouraged as the event generally does sell out.
the soul food luncheon is a popular annual black history month event at kcc featuring a lunch of traditional african american dishes. this year’s menu includes traditional fried chicken, ribs and mac and cheese prepared by kcc staff and faculty, with sweet potatoes and collard greens provided by taste-a-licious catering. dessert choices include banana pudding, pound cake and peach cobbler.
the soul food luncheon event started at kcc as a way for then vice president of student services l. marshall washington to share his family’s recipes with the college and the public. the event grew to involve other kcc employees and their family recipes.
the soul food luncheon overlaps with kcc’s black-owned business showcase event, held at the same time in the binda lobby, kellogg room and student center. the showcase event will welcome black-owned businesses, entrepreneurs, startups and supporters to kcc to collaborate, network and strengthen relationships in the local community.
for more information about black history month events at kcc, visit kellogg.edu/bhm or contact kcc’s student life office at 269-565-2634 or studentlife@kellogg.edu.
