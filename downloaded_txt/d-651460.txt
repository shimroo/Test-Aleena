						"we couldn't be happier with our decision to send our son to gan yisroel. as parents, the sense of chassidishe values instilled in him during his time at camp are truly invaluable. the stories he brings home about new friendships, exciting activities, and the warmth of the staff make us feel like we made the right choice. gan yisroel has not just provided a summer experience; it's been a growthful journey for our son."

mordy sstaff member 






						"this summer at gan yisroel was the best one yet! from the awesome sports activities to the cool arts and crafts, and of course the learning classes i had a blast every day. the counselors are so much fun, and i made friends from all over the states. i learned a lot about being a chassidishe bochur, my personal highlight of the summer was color war. can't wait to go back next year!"

						"choosing gan yisroel parksville for our son was one of the best decisions we've made as parents. the emphasis on both fun and learning is impressive. the dedicated staff, engaging activities, and the strong focus on learning classes create a holistic experience that goes beyond just a typical lubavitch summer camp. our son comes home with a smile on his face that lasts a full year until he goes back again. gan yisroel has become an integral part of our son's life."

swimming 









									daily swimming in our outdoor or indoor pools. all aquatic activities are under careful supervision of experienced and certified red cross lifeguards. safety is our primary concern. campers are required to take a swimming ability test in order to enter the deep water.
								















water activities 









									in order to keep cool on the hot summer days we offer a variety of water fun! we have boating on our lake with canoes, kayaks and paddle boats. outdoor water play is always a highlight for the campers!
								















arts and crafts
 









									arts and crafts is a popular activity for children of all ages! we utilize this time as a way of blending judaism into the camp day by having arts and crafts with a jewish theme. the beautiful projects not only remind the children of their exciting summer, but can function in the home as a mezuzah, charity box and so much more!
								















wood working 









									woodwork is a powerful medium for building self-esteem. children feel empowered and valued by being trusted to work with real tools. they show satisfaction in their mastery of new skills and take immense pride in their creations.
								















sports & athletics
 









									at gan israel campers participate in various sports activities, including soccer, basketball, baseball, football and much more. we have indoor/outdoor hockey. there are sports leagues for each division. our focus on good sportsmanship and self-confidence makes everyone a winner!
								















field trips 









									we will be going on fun, exciting and safe trips throughout camp. amusement parks, water parks, bowling, ice skating, bounce/trampoline. just to name a few.  we strive to give the campers a summer of fun and good times! 
								















challah baking 









									we have challah baking for our different divisions.  								















in-house entertainment 









									we bring the fun to camp with exciting shows. this includes, magic shows, mentalist, ventriloquist, acrobatics, concerts and stunt shows.								















nature 









									introducing the  natural environment to children can help them think beyond their immediate surroundings and build well-rounded perspectives. nature-based learning and education improves a child’s academic performance and critical thinking. we have a special survival activity where campers are taught about plants and building a shelter while in the wilderness. 
								















daily learning classes 









									classes are tailored to accommodate every camper to their level and capability. the children learn chumash, mishnayos, halacha, gemara, tanya and sichos. children are encouraged to learn tanya and mishnayos by heart. our famous optional cacao club where the boys get to come for extra learning in the morning is b”h very well attended. 
								















special events 









									late nights, runaways, acrobatic shows, concerts, fireworks display, grand outdoor staff play.
								















canteen 









									fully stocked with packaged food and drinks as well as hot food.
