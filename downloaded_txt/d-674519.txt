this conversation on “mindfulness in bitesized practices” was recorded for collington, a kendal lifecare community in maryland. my conversation partner is sandy short.







dear friends,i’d like to welcome you into an exploration about how to weather uncertainty and change, which was a conversation with residents and others who are part of the frasier life care community in boulder colorado. the term “permanent whitewater” fits the tumult of pandemic and political aggression which we are experiencing. and the ideas shared are meant as a handhold for those who are looking for ways to steady up in the midst of all that is coming at them.

polarities: judy brown 

dear friends,i wanted to share with you a relaxed chat about leadership i did recently. here at home, in a rocking chair, near the fireplace. the program was hosted by the eden alternative, a leader in the non-profit world of service to elders. as many of you know that’s a world in which i offer leadership development programs—in partnership with leading age and the kendal corporation. as the conversation evolved, it turned to how to take care of ourselves as leaders, in these times of “permanent whitewater”. i wanted to share it with you. next best thing to having you here in the living room with me!

 

while this exploration of personal resilience in times of change was written with covid in mind, i hope it might also help people steady themselves so they can be a force for change in the wake of the murder of george floyd as we wrestle with our history of violence and racism.  my presentation on resilience was at the request of kendal corporation, a nonprofit organization of life care communities and in-home support of elders.  it includes my video presentation (welcome to my living room), links to helpful ted talks and two poems.  please feel free to pass the links along where they might be helpful.

keepers of the flame



may 23, 2021




i’ve happened onto a new process with poetry and i want to share what i’m learning from it. when someone finds a use for a poem of mine, i take that as a signal that the universe wants me to pay attention to the poem myself, and to learn something new from it. always there is something new. i may have had something in mind when i first wrote the poem, but other people see different things in it. and so might i in this moment. things i’d not seen before. here’s my most recent example of that practice.

turning towards life:  a podcast



dec 8, 2019




out of the blue, i got an e-mail from a stranger named justin wise in the uk with a link to a half-hour podcast that he and colleague lizzie had done, about my poem fire and what it suggests to them. justin was reflecting on his habit of piling on more work. and lizzie who is three weeks into motherhood, sees the poem as guidance and encouragement. i'm delighted (it's always a gift to know that our work in the world has been of use, near or faraway). the words of the poem are my own. but i'm curious about their take on it. so i listen.

being baffled



feb 23, 2019




yesterday, a friend was searching for a poem to share with people who are training to be coaches—life coaches not football coaches. (although come to think of it poetry for football coaches might be a good thing.) as i thought about it, i realized that when i need coaching, myself, (which is fairly often) it is usually because i am feeling stuck, confused, mired in.and what came to mind for me were these words by the farmer poet wendell berry:

kaleidoscope: see what you see



jan 12, 2019




often, i find myself stuck in an old way of seeing things.  or fearful of the way things are unfolding around me.  seeking a path forward. not seeing one.   the poem below (prompted by the kaleidoscope which i keep on my bookshelf) emerged in a gathering in my living room as friends and colleagues explored their own role in leadership development.  it reminds me of the need for breathing space, a chance to “turn” the kaleidoscope of images, to seek and practice new ways of seeing, of being wholly ourselves.

the lion tamer



oct 6, 2017




time magazine recently ran a piece on all the factors that contributed to the closing of ringling brothers circus.  not the least of which has been the rise of a different kind of circus:cirque de soleil. while i've been fascinated with the ascent of cirque, i amhaunted by a photo that accompanied the time magazine story--a photo of the empty ringling bros circus circle with the lion tamer and lion together in what could only be described as an embrace. a last embrace.
