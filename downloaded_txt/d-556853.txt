the humboldt grassfed beef promise
we sincerely appreciate the trust our customers have put in us to provide them with a safe, wholesome, great tasting product. this is a responsibility we take seriously, and will always err on the side of safely and health of the animal over profit. 
our commitment to our customers:

provide the healthiest natural beef possible

as long time cattle producers, the care and treatment of our animals is our highest priority. those of us who work with livestock know that animal care is more than simply good practice. it’s the right thing to do. we maintained the strictest of quality assurance standards, enabling us to provide our customers with safe, high quality beef they can be proud to serve to their families.


gain and maintain your confidence in the integrity of our beef

as a family owned business, the people who own the cattle are providing the day to day care and treatment of the animals. it is important to us that our cattle are handled humanely. each of us have participated in industry quality assurance programs, and we continue to educate ourselves about new handling practices.
we strictly follow all usda requirements for processing. all of our cattle are sent to a usda inspected facility. this allows us to ensure that our cattle are handled both humanely and safely.


provide beef with the best flavor and tenderness possible

all of our cattle are raised free range and are never confined. they are never fed antibiotics or synthetic hormones.


be sensitive and respectful of our natural resources

raising market ready grassfed beef requires a higher plain of nutrition and necessitates a reduction in herd size. by decreasing herd size we are able to better manage health and increase the natural performance of our cattle while protecting the surrounding watershed and other natural resources.
