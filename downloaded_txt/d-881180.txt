oriental bird club

the oriental bird club is for birders and ornithologists around the world who are interested in birds of the oriental region and their conservation

 

over 300 oriental bird species are considered by birdlife international as threatened by forest destruction, wetland drainage, hunting and trade. conservation of these species is often hampered by a lack of knowledge. oriental bird club supports conservation work in the oriental region by encouraging studies of birds and their habitats.through the generous support of members and corporate sponsors, the obc conservation fund has supported hundreds of projects throughout asia, primarily run by local people. more than £250,000 has been invested in conservation in the region since 1984. more information, including how to apply for a grant, can be found here.

missed the webinar on nordmann’s greenshank? don’t worry…here’s a recording















on 11th february 2023 the obc  hosted an online webinar entitled knowing the nordmann's greenshank.the speakers were philipp maleko of the wildlife conservation society and khwankhao sinhaseni of the bird conservation society of thailand. if you missed their presentations, you can watch them on youtube by clicking the image above. with a population of just over a thousand individuals, the nordmann’s greenshank is among the rarest of the world’s migratory birds. little is known about its ecology although recent field studies are beginning to shed light into its unusual breeding habits—it is one of very few shorebirds that nests high in trees in the dense forests of the russian far east.
