northwest artists lighting up the holidays 















christmas in the northwest artists have been lighting up the holidays, and raising money for northwest children’s hospitals through the sale of christmas in the northwest cd compilations since 1985.  these artists generously donate their songs so that all children can have access to medical care, regardless of their family’s ability to pay.
we are honored that dave matthews band, heart, kenny g, steve miller band and so many other talented northwest artists have generously given their support to christmas in the northwest.
please purchase and share these wonderful gifts of christmas music with your family and friends. they’ll love the music, and you’ll feel the warmth of the lives you’ve touched.
it’s now easier than ever to purchase cds, downloadable cds, or individual songs from the christmas in the northwest collection. to get started just visit our listen and buy page, visit the itunes store, or purchase from our facebook music store. 










 

 

 


















saving up christmas - loni rose 







 







									saving up christmas was recorded by loni rose in 2004 and included on christmas in the northwest volume 7. it resonates even more today as we celebrate the return of our troops from iraq just in time for christmas. if this video touches you, we ask you to please share it with your friends, so together we can recognize the great sacrifices made on our behalf by our brave soldiers, and the families they miss and who miss them so dearly everyday; but especially on the holidays.								



thanks to sue ennis and hummie mann for writing this amazing song, to loni rose for singing it and to steven ray allen for his amazing arrangement and production! saving up christmas can be found on christmas in the northwest volume 7, at www.christmasinthenorthwest.com. net proceeds from the sale of christmas in the northwest benefits seattle children’s hospital
