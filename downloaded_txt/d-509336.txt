our plastic surgery practice
our indianapolis plastic surgery practice consists of three closely affiliated entities: meridian plastic surgeons, the meridian plastic surgery center and spa 170 west. our coordinated mission is to provide superior evaluation and treatment of plastic surgery patients in an environment that is safe and technologically advanced but also honest, warm and caring.

we strive for distinction by pursuing quality care that balances technical precision and clinical expertise with artistry, creativity and innovation. we intend to provide this care within the context of a professional, caring and supportive relationship. we are committed to observing the highest safety and ethical standards in our industry. we maintain quality and safety through regular physician and staff education and ongoing practice assessments. we are dedicated to continual advancement in all aspects of our field: technique, quality, safety and confidentiality.
our goal is to provide an excellent patient experience using the safest proven techniques. while desired outcomes can never be guaranteed in our specialty, patient satisfaction is our ultimate priority. we are intent on providing the best possible outcome and most natural-looking results for any identified concern.
because of our success with these efforts, we are recognized as teachers and thought leaders in our field. our physicians actively influence the conversation in plastic surgery through their research, publications and lectures. we also enthusiastically support the training of next generation plastic surgeons through our relationships with fellowship and residency programs.
