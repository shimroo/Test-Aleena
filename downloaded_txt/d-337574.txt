how to body wrap to lose fat & inches





want to lose inches fast?  body wrap treatments are a quick way to lose inches in the belly, abdominal, or stomach area. body wraps also detoxify, exfoliate and soften skin. spas offer expensive body wrap treatments. a cheaper alternative is to do it yourself at home. body wrap kits can be purchased or you can create your own wrap with a simple body wrap recipe.

whichever route you choose, here are some helpful tips to get the most out of your body wrap experience. warm your room so that you can lie down comfortably and quietly. use plastic drop sheets to minimize the mess, one to set your bucket on and another to lie on. light candles, burn essential oils and play soft relaxation music. take a warm shower before applying the wrap to open your pores. drink lots of water before, during, and after the treatment to help flush out toxins. have a hot bath a couple of days following the treatment to release accumulated toxins. avoid caffeine, sugar, fried fatty foods, soda and alcohol for the next 48 hours.

going to the spa and getting a body wrap is simple, just relax. performing a body wrap at home is relatively simple. if you are using a premixed wrap kit, follow the accompanying instructions. you can also create your own mixture following a body wrap recipe. 

if you are using a do-it-yourself recipe, first assemble the necessary ingredients. these vary by wrap, but a common recipe uses green clay, olive oil, sea salt, water and herbs.  measure out 1 cup green clay, 2 tablespoons olive oil, ¼ cup sea salt and 2 cups water. select desired herbs from herbs and essential oils, such as sage, lemongrass, rosemary, lavender, grapefruit, ground basil, rose petal powder, ginger root powder, neem powder, rosehip powder, alfalfa leaf powder. 

to begin, boil the water and stir in the sea salt until it dissolves. add the olive oil, green clay and selected herbs and oils. stir until a paste forms and set the mixture aside to cool. once the paste is cool enough to handle, apply to the skin using a paintbrush or your hands. begin application at your ankles and work upwards.
to cover the mixture, you can use either plain towels (keep in mind that the mixture may not completely wash out afterwards) or cut an old sheet into three-inch wide strips. cover the mixture with slight tension. leave the wraps for one hour before removing. take a cool or lukewarm bath to remove the paste.

tips on losing weight to avoid injury





it should be no mystery, that the more weight an individual carries, the more likelihood they are to suffer from orthopedic injuries, and conditions of wear and tear. this can be more time on the doctors table, and debilitating joint degeneration issues as these individuals  age. if you enter any hospital physical therapy department you will often see a physical therapy assistant  working with individuals whom are in need of weight loss. in fact almost every major orthopedic surgery procedure from knee replacement to hip replacement requires that a patient loses a significant amount of weight. 

the entire physical therapy industry is seeing a boom currently, from licensed physical therapists, do an increased amount of physical therapy assistant schools across the nation. the profession is in a growth period of over 30% in the next 7 years, and much of this is due to the increasing levels of over-weight individuals. those who are over-weight are far more likely to be injured or need an assistive therapy.

the weight loss industry is a massive business at this point, with well over 40% of the american population suffering from obesity it is no surprise. every magic pill under the sun has become available on the market to assist or give the illusion to those battling weight that this will be their answer. the answer for weight loss is often less exciting, it is generally fine tuning a diet, and having a disciplined exercise routine that helps the individual reverse many of the effects of raised insulin levels in the body. your best bet is to see a qualified nutrition practitioner, and hire the assistance of a personal trainer. if you are on a tight budget then see each practitioner once and have them develop a plan that is adaptable that you can follow.

finding motivation is the next step to being more active, for diet this can be learning and trying new recipes that are more healthy with less sugars and simple carbohydrates than what the typical american diet serves up. find a workout buddy and keep each other motivated to stick to the work out plans, and hold each other accountable.

the bottom line with weight loss it is your health, and your health is worth even a small investment to kickstart your way to better health, and a more slim and trim body.if weight loss cannot be achieved, as one ages the fear of spending their time in physical therapy clinics can easily become a reality.  no matter your current condition or age, improving ones diet and having a moderate amount of exercise to coincide with a more active lifestyle can easily be achieved. the bottom line for avoiding injury for the average individual is to keep your weight down. some things in life are accidents and cannot be avoided, but carrying excess weight is essentially increasing your risks for debilitating injury that will have an impact on your life. if you are carrying some extra pounds,  there is no better day than today to begin your weight loss journey

the harmful effects of crash dieting





the purpose of crash dieting is to lose weight and fast. by definition a crash diet is a diet that is under 1, 200 calories eaten daily. there are many effects of crash dieting including short-term weight loss, short-term dehydration, short-term nutritional deprivation (which can lead to long-term problems), risk of fainting or heart attack and long-term health complications.

the first effect will be short-term weight loss. there are two major reasons that your diet will only achieve short-term weight loss. primarily, crash diets slow down your body’s metabolic rate. your body wants to maximize each calorie it receives because it is afraid of starvation so continued weight loss after the crash diet is extremely difficult. further, in the short period of time that the individual is on the diet the weight that they lose is not made up predominantly of fat. the quick results are due to dehydration; it is just water weight that has been lost. as soon as you begin to consume food again your body will retain moisture and you will bloat. all of the weight will be gained back.

the next effects, short-term dehydration and nutritional deprivation, can go hand in hand. even if you consume a lot of water throughout your diet it is hard for your body to retain water if you are not eating balanced meals. severely reducing your caloric intake deprives your body of vitamins, carbohydrates, proteins and nutrients that it needs to sustain itself. having a diet low in fat is good but having a diet free from fat is not acceptable, your body needs 30% of its daily calories to come from fats. in addition, a lot of crash diets suggest the use of laxatives or salt water flushes which increase risk of dehydration and don’t allow the body to absorb nutrients and fats which in turn leads to nutritional deprivation.

the risk of fainting, especially during exertion and exercise is a real one when you are on a crash diet. this effect comes from too few calories, a drastic change in routine and excessive exercise/demand on your body. feeling light-headed is a sign that you need to workout less and eat more. not only is fainting a warning sign but you can also hurt yourself when you fall, causing long-term damage. this excessive strain also applies to your heart, putting you at an increased risk of heart attack and long-term cardiac damage. 

let’s take a look at some of the long-term health complications that can arise from excessive crash dieting, or yo-yo dieting. they weaken your immune system, 
cause heart palpitations and cardiac stress. if you do one crash diet you may not hurt your heart but if you crash diet repeatedly you can increase your risk of heart attacks. crash diets also lead to heart muscle loss in the long run. you damage your blood vessels when the muscle shrinks and grows and the micro tears create an environment perfect for atherosclerosis or other types of heart disease. 

experts are not entirely sure of the exact dangers of crash diets that lead to heart problems but it is thought that shortages of potassium, magnesium and copper could be causing the arhythmias in crash dieters. an arrhythmia is a disorder of the heart rate or heart rhythm, such as beating too fast, too slow or irregularly. it is also thought that a drop in blood pressure and sodium depletion contribute. 

if you were considering a crash diet, you should reconsider. not only will it be unsuccessful in helping you achieve weight loss but also you will undoubtedly expose yourself to health risks in the long run. if you need to lose weight, try decreasing your calorie intake slightly, making healthy choices and participating in a sensible exercise routine.
