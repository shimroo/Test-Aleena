alpheus 25 years
as of this month, april ’24, this web site alpheus has seen the light of day for 25 years! it all started with hosting the paper krishnamurti and the world teacher project in 1999 and its accompanying pamphlets. the site was initially hosted by prodigy, but in 2001 it upgraded to its own url with a new design (still here with all its content). the most important posting since then was  the jaynesian paradigm and beyond in 2014, which still provides the leading framework for my current studies on krishnamurti. at the same time the site transferred to a wordpress platform with an upgraded design. what the future will bring is uncertain, but there are some smaller papers about krishnamurti in the make.
india
since may 2022 i am residing in india and live on the campus of north-eastern hills university, in the capital shillong of the state of meghalaya. i’m pursuing a degree in philosophy and will focus on a phenomenological assessment of the teachings of krishnamurti.
i did have time to finish older articles like one on ‘gradiance‘ and one on historical periodization, especially the span of ‘modernity‘. i also ventured into economic theory: one blog on the post-keynesian concept of money creation and an article challenging some conclusions developed in the context of modern monetary theory (mmt).
krishnamurti
except for the article on jaynes (2014) and later ones, all these articles on krishnamurti were from the critical theosophical perspective that krishnamurti was found, trained and meant to be the next world teacher, but that he failed. in other words, the world teacher project with krishnamurti was genuine but not successful. this position i held from ca. 1987 till ca. 2013. before that i was committed to his teachings based on a few interconnected factors, like the inspirational nature and rational soundness of his teachings, the personal experience of the ‘energetic vastness’ krishnamurti wrote about in his 1961 notebook (1976), and my  sense of the feasibility of his revolution based on vimala thakar’s autobiography on an eternal voyage (1966).  after 2010 the theosophical framework started falling apart and therefore also the krishnamurti critique based on it. after 2013 a more secular, philosophical re-assessment took place in which the ideas of jaynes (1976) were prominent.

monetary reform
for four conferences i have been involved with the american monetary institute. a team is working on a new governance template and and we just set up a new web site. please sample, and if you like to volunteer, let us know. the next conference will be from friday september 27 till sunday september 29, 2024. check here for latest updates.
the alliance for just money is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with its own active web site and presence on facebook and twitter. if you like to keep informed about the alliance’s activities, please sign up for their news letter. and most of its activities like coffee house gatherings, newsletters and special announcements, are curated on the afjm archive page.
the first serious campaign the alliance is involved in is the how we pay for a better world campaign. see here the introductory video.  and here you can purchase the accompanying book.
the second serious campaign is centered around “afjm resolution #1” adopted by the alliance for just money calling for a national commission, which should investigate the current dysfunctional monetary system and explore the benefits of implementing a fully publicly owned and operated national monetary system, per the constitution, originating all money to exchange goods and services for the general welfare of the people of the nation. if you agree that such a national commission should be established you are invited to sign the afjm petition to that end. to keep track of all relevant documents and articles regarding the resolution and petition, check here.
the alliance also has stepped into the publishing business by releasing a spanish anthology of a dozen translations of high quality articles on the latest findings in monetary theory and on ongoing improved reasons for real monetary reform.
the title is democratizar el dinero. una introducción a la reforma del dinero soberano (democratizing money: an introduction to sovereign monetary reform) and is available in print, as a downloadable pdf, and as an audiobook (forthcoming).

politics
under the questionable leadership of president donald trump the us administration had become increasingly dysfunctional and in the case of the epa, literally toxic. fortunately the framework of ponerology, i.e. the scholarly investigation of psychopathology at a societal scale, can bring some necessary insights into current political developments. a few posts were dedicated to the subject:
