welcome to manchester!
manchester is a city born of hope and optimism, and filled with promise. my great great grandparents certainly felt that way when they made the long trek from montreal to manchester in 1896 in search of a better life working in our city’s millyard.
today, we are writing the opening lines to an exciting new chapter in our tale. from the revolution in our millyard, to our theater scene, sports and concert venues to name just a few, our possibilities are endless and limited only by how far our dreams can take us. 
i want to hear from you, as i firmly believe our city’s strength is in you, our residents. it is an honor to serve you as mayor, and i look forward to working with you to take our beloved queen city to its full potential.
 
sincerely,
mayor jay ruais
