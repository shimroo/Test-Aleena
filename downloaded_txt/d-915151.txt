we only want to work on transactions
that we can add value to.

we put our clients ahead of the firm
and the firm ahead of ourselves.

our goal is to always do more
than is expected of us.

we like each other. we feel lucky to be working with each other. we help each other, and we don't let each other down.

we know whom we are recommending to our clients and we want to keep it that way.

our sandbox skills are well-developed:
we play well with others.

we do our best with clients who want to team up with a real estate company.

we're confident. we don't have to make anybody else look bad to make ourselves look good.

we like to work hard and we like hard work. our clients don't hire us to do what's easy.

we've always had a commitment to things larger than our own pocketbooks... which enriches us and our approach.
