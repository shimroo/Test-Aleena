welcome to marketing society!
hello there and welcome to our site! if you are here, the assumption is that you have an interest in marketing. if we are wrong about this, forgive our presumption but donât leave yet as there is a lot that you can gain from scrolling through our various articles.




























what is our focus?
marketing! if there is a term that people have tried to break down and simplify over the years, with some successes and many fails, this is it. what do you understand by the term marketing? if you go through most dictionaries, you will find that they refer to it as an action taken to promote and sell products and services, with the inclusion of market research and advertising. does that explanation help you or does it further confuse you?
the truth is that even people in the marketing field will feel a bit confused after reading such a definition. why is this? well, marketing is much broader than this and defining it in one sentence feels unjust to this field to which so many businesses owe their success.
take an example of the definition above. the emphasis seems to lie in selling which paints a picture of salespeople grappling to get you to buy things. it also gets into advertising and what does this have you picturing? for most people, it is the idea of a couple of people huddled around a desk trying to think of a way to sell their products to their target populace. but it is much more than that, and this is what we try to show you on this site.







simplicity
we simplify the definitions in marketing such that we can show you other ways in which you can regard this field. suppose someone told you that marketing involves putting yourself in the customerâs shoes and thinking of what can satisfy them and using this information to attract them to a product. with this perspective, you donât get to look at marketing as a way to get money from your target market, but rather as a means of developing what you have to offer such that it meets the needs in the market. in this way, you will create a demand for your products, and you will thus have an easier time selling them. how does that sound?












thoroughness
the truth is that, once you start a business, you realize that marketing is an important aspect from the inception to the end if you wish to run a successful enterprise. all of our partners understand this - no matter if they do business online like the independent online casino review website topratedcasinosites.co.uk or have both online and off line presence like our folks from bgdf.
we take a look at what the other definitions have in common and what about these ideas appeals to those who follow them. take the example of the first marketing definition which seems to focus on sales and advertising. if you think about it on a deep level, you begin to see that there is a lot about these two sectors that feature in marketing. the truth is that, once you start a business, you realize that marketing is an important aspect from the inception to the end if you wish to run a successful enterprise.











you may wonder why this is the case, but a closer look will help you view the situation in a different light. remember where we stated that marketing is about regarding the product as if you were the customer? well, this plays a significant role during the development of the product. you can think of ways in which you can craft the product such that it appeals to the target audience and this will save you lots of changes in the future. an analysis of your customers through the making of focus groups, the use of surveys and reading several studies only helps you in making products that are acceptable in the market, which is all about marketing.
itâs all about what the consumers want and when they want it and how they want it. and how do you score points in all these aspects? you guessed it right: marketing!















what do we do?
we take you through the definition of marketing, the different types there are and strategies in place, the importance of marketing and how you can grow your business using the same. through helping you think outside the box and uncover new ways to get your name out there, we push your business to the next level. whether you are thinking of starting a business or are already in the game, we have lots of informative articles that will give you that extra push to excel in the field of your choice.














the goal
we want to help you get people interested in your business by taking advantage of analyses, researches and the interests of your consumers as you seek ways in which you can exploit marketing techniques.  through the application of marketing tactics, you will enjoy more efficiency and success in your business and can, therefore, enjoy more profits in the end.
be sure to check the site frequently as we add tons of articles on current marketing trends as they come. thank you!
