insights & benefits of procyon systems










the system is saving us hundreds of staff hours per year


senior manager








before we were organising contacts on a month by month basis, now we can plan contact sessions for 6 months in advance and can better predict our resource needs.


contact co-ordinator








now i can see schedule changes and cancellations, and feedback contact reports in real time.


contact supervisor








moving from our previous spreadsheet solution has significantly reduced errors and failed contact meetings.
