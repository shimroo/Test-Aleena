garbage 
            pail kids — 
            a parody sticker phenomenon released by the topps chewing gum company, 
            starting in 1985, that were developed by art spiegelman and mark newgarden; 
            both art directors, editors, writers and conceptual artists for the 
            gpk franchise and its entire original series run. both provided nomenclature 
            for the characters with a naming panel that also included len brown 
            and stan hart with suggestions by the artists, writers and even last 
            minute name changes by arthur shorin, the then president of topps. 
            

            artists john pound (who worked with acrylics and airbrushing), the 
            gpk grandfather and tom bunk (who worked with gouache and airbrushing) 
            together completed around 90% of the finished artwork for the card 
            fronts, later joined by james warhola (who worked with oils; sketch 
            to final, no color rough), david burke, james bennett, mae jeon and 
            bill wray (one final piece). card backs were completed by tom bunk, 
            jay lynch, howard cruse and richard mcguire who animated the 'flick 
            it' section of the later series. the writers included newgarden, spiegelman, 
            lynch, and john mariano. other individuals who assisted by penciling, 
            inking, coloring or lettering were carole sobocinski, bob fingerman, 
            grass green and javi soler. others contributed ideas and sketches 
            such as len brown, frank santopadre (writer), stephen kroninger, bob 
            sikoryak and paul karasik. these collaborators made garbage pail kids 
            the most hyped and talked about craze in non-sport card history.

            in 2003, the topps company, inc. took advantage of the increasingly 
            nostalgic craze for 80's games and toys and released seven all-new 
            series gpk sets over a period of several years through 2007, three 
            flashback sets that contained orginal gpk artwork, along with 'lost' 
            material and all-new content in 2010 and 2011. three rejuvinated brand-new 
            series gpk sets were released in 2012 and 2013, including a 'mini' 
            set, with a more nostaglic gpk feel, and six chrome technoloy sets 
            in 2013, 2014, 2020, 2022, & 2023 plus additional releases, including 
            sapphire. the recent, yearly gpk sets, containing mostly thematic 
            subsets, have been released from 2014 through 2023. weekly and monthly 
            online releases have also been released from 2016 through 2025. the 
            sets have been art directed and edited by john williams (ans), followed 
            by jeff zapata (ans/fb), colin walton (fb/ans/yearly), by jessica 
            kanzer (yearly), and later by others. 

            the continued gpk craze is comprised of veteran artists john pound, 
            tom bunk, james warhola, frank santopadre, and jay lynch—who 
            supplied concept and card back artwork along with scott shaw, as well 
            as a long very long list of next-generation artists, including but 
            not limited to, luis diaz, brent engstrom, dave gross, fred harper, 
            layron dejarnette, mark pingitore, junghwa im, fred wheaton, joe simko, 
            neil camera, joe mcwilliams, etcetera. ira friedman, vice president 
            of global licensing at topps, has worked extensively and exhaustively 
            in expanding the gpk brand through product licensing, starting heavily 
            in 2018—and retiring from in 2023.




   

  



  

 



february 
            2023 — a twenty-five year 
            look-back after publishing the website in 1998. i wanted the pages 
            to reflect and report on material beyond the scope of just a series 
            checklist and regular card information, but to also investigate the 
            minutiae of development and production. but most importantly, to put 
            an artist name to every image; to give credit where credit was sorely 
            missing and due. beginning in the early 2000s, i began to research 
            in earnest and to compile the all-inclusive, but no longer exclusive, 
            comprehensive checklists, with my starting point being a 1989 blab! 
            anthology publication, and then proceeding to pester the artists 
            directly. mark newgarden and jay lynch were instrumental in assisting 
            me with information & names on some of the lessor known artists 
            & contributors and with helping me to reach the goal in sharing 
            these extensive, work-in-progress checklists in 2003. prior to james 
            warhola having a website, i went through a relative of his to establish 
            contact, but it wasn't always an easy task filling in the gaps; this 
            included work by mae jeon, the mysterious james burke, james bennett, 
            etcetera. i would eventually go visit mark and bunk in new york during 
            the autumn of 2005, to check out their art studios and dig through 
            stacks of amazing history, while graciously being served coffee and 
            tea, respectively, throughout the day. i would apply this same type 
            of investigation for the trash can trolls & bathroom buddies checklists 
            in 2008, and be the sole reason all of the gross bears & bathroom 
            buddies cards would later be printed for the gpk yearly thematic bonus 
            box releases—sorry, but not sorry. the extremely non-flashy site 
            has taken on many changes over the years—and i'm still slowly 
            plugging away. so many thanks for taking the journey with me and reading 
            these journal-entry-like hobby pages for all these years.

            like your gpk site very much. nice and very

            email excerpts:
"i 
            just do roughs and others do the finished art. i did the final art 
            for the comic backs of the gpk cards--but i did roughs of them first. 
            send 
            me your address, and i will start sending you xeroxes." —

            "hi. regarding the interview, you must clear it with monte beauchamp 
            of blab, there were some edits & exclusions in the interview i 
            wasn't so happy with at the time so if he says yes send me a copy 
            so i can clarify any points. (i was one of a team of talented people 
            who brought you gpks as you know.) mn" — newgarden. 
            january 05, 2001
            "the intro info about me sounds mostly correct. i also did concept 
            sketches for several hundred gpks, as did art and mark. i 
            didn't know bill wray had done any gpk fronts. do you know which ones? 
            i thought tom bunk did the art for the early backs, not mark newgarden? 
            here's tom bunks email..." — pound. 
            january 09, 2003
            "thanks for your friendly email and for your interest in the 
            gpks. i've checked your website and there is a lot of information 
            and i will gladly supply you with more, especially information concerning 
            my role. during that time i was in brooklyn at topps every week, hanging 
            around art and mark, lenny and stan, etc. it was hectic, exciting, 
            quite stressful, but a lot of fun. i also took part in many other 
            topps projects... anyway, i'll write to you more in the next few days, 
            right now it's already past midnight..." — bunk.

            "i did one for art... i believe it was a kid in a football uniform. 
            maybe he was kicking a football that made his leg shatter? ps, i'd 
            love the card if you can find an extra!" — wray. 
            january 12, 2003
            "i worked on gpk with mark and art for about a year. in that 
            time i did about 90. i have no list to send you but i certainly
            would recognize the art if there are any that you have a question 
            about. send those anyway that is convenient, it's very easy for me 
            to say yea or nay" — warhola. february 
            03, 2003
            "in the past year, i've made less than a grand from topps for 
            doing topps stuff. i haven't had any work from them since last summer. 
            i haven't heard anything about a new gpk series coming out. somehow, 
            i don't think they could put such a thing together now. do any of 
            the old gpk guys know anything about this? howard cruse 
            did many gpk backs too." 
            — lynch. march 02, 2003
            "thanks for thinking of me and dropping in on my site. i enjoyed 
            visiting your site, too. it brings back lots of memories. my 
            contribution to the garbage pail kids saga was doing the drawings 
            for the backs of [the] "giant" cards." 
            — cruse. march 03, 2003
            "i have all the official flow charts we kept that recorded who 
            was doing what on what, when it was due etc. that would help put the 
            big puzzle together... if you are ever in nyc you're welcome to comb 
            thru it with me for clues but honestly it's too big a job to take 
            on without a gun pointed straight at my head or an enthusiastic researcher 
            knocking at the door..."  — newgarden.

              "the topps company, with a stable of legendary underground 
              cartoonists created garbage pail kids in 1985. the gross-out humor 
              and subversive attitude appealed to the kids of the time and quickly 
              became a massive success. as the garbage pail kids’ notoriety 
              grew, so too did their popularity on the playground. school 
              administrators banning garbage pail kids from school grounds further 
              fueled their demand for more than a dozen additional card series.




this pop-culture phenomenon 
              inspired plenty of tie-in items as toy and novelty stores experienced 
              a wave of merchandise that included t-shirts, school folders, sticker 
              albums, jewelry, key chains, and yes actual garbage pails. today, 
              that list of gpk merchandise has expanded to partnerships with funko, 
              fye, santa cruz, chalk line, geeki tikis, wwe, netflix, and more! 
              with over three decades of gross fun, garbage pail kids is celebrating 
              its 35th anniversary in 2020. look for more outrageous fun with 
              card sets in hobby and retail stores, exclusive topps.com sticker 
              card sets, new video content, and even more fun collaborations!"
