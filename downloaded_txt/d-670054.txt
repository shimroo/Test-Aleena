welcome to the official website of skip dyrda!
based in the vibrant arts community of sarasota, florida, i am a visual artist with a passion for creativity and storytelling. my journey has led me to maintain two studios where i bring my artistic visions to life. known for my trompe l’oeil murals, i strive to create works with deep historical significance that captivate and inspire.
beyond my murals, i excel in graphic design, offering branding services, designing books, magazines, and advertisements. my artistry extends to photography, where i take pride in mastering the post-production phase to create stunning images. i have also ventured into sculpture, creating pieces that add a new dimension to my portfolio.
recently, i’ve embarked on a new adventure: writing fantasy stories. this website is your gateway to explore my diverse body of work and join me on my creative journey. thank you for visiting, and i hope you enjoy exploring my world as much as i enjoy creating it.
