acclaim



“vocally luminous.”— new york times“there’s a challenge in trying to describe her voice. it’s the richness and the warmth and the depth just in the sound itself that’s so mesmerizing. but it’s not just the quality of the voice, it’s also her sensitivity and intention. it’s her use of text, the way she connects with language. and her very refined sophisticated understanding of how things are unfolding musically, so it’s this marvelous combination of heart, mind and vocal cords that’s just incomparable. there’s something special about what she does that only she can do.”— conductor robert spano“jessica rivera created an intimacy unparalleled by anything else on the program. with great placement of each note, her beautiful tone resonated without being too powerful. she presented a maternal quality of reassurance in both sound and gentle gestures.”— kcmetropolis“hers was a voice of ravishing fullness.”— cleveland plain dealer
