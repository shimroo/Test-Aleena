ultrafast molecular photoswitch





an international collaboration led by researchers from the kansas state university physics department and the 
oxford university chemistry department has studied ultrafast processes in the molecular photoswitch quadricyclane, published recently in 
nature chemistry.



quadricyclane and 
norbornadiene are two isomers, that is molecules with the same chemical formula but different geometry, which interconvert upon absorption of ultraviolet light. quadricyclane is the higher-energy isomer and can be used to store solar energy, which is then released by a catalytic process as heat. so-called molecular solar thermal 
(most) 
devices exploit such isomer pairs to, for instance, warm houses by absorbing energy from the sun during the day and then releasing it at night.


the experiment, led by kansas state physics professor 
daniel rolles and his graduate student 
kurtis borne, used ultrashort light pulses produced by the 
fermi free-electron laser facility in trieste, italy, to track the conversion between the two isomers on a timescale of femtoseconds. the experimental results were interpreted with the help of state-of-the-art computer simulations done in oxford. the combined study discovered faster than previously identified pathways leading to the conversion, which may help designing new ways of controlling the outcome and efficiency of this important class of photoreactions.

what's new?





daniel rolles, professor in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, has been selected as a 2024 
fellow of the american physical society 
for 

pioneering experiments on imaging ultrafast molecular reactions with xuv and x-ray free-electron lasers, and for advancing our understanding of the interaction of ultra-intense x-ray pulses with atoms and molecules.
