  hassle free fun
we take the hassle out of river trips and double shuttling. our hq in scottsville is a stone's throw from the james river. you and your group can park at our private riverside parking lot. from there you will be briefed on your trip and shuttled to your destination with equipment reading by our staff. then it's just you and mother nature! don't forget the cooler for your group as they float back to your car, parked at riverside. make your reservation today!
