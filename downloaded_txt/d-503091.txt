 welcome


the knoxville rowing association is a private, not-for-profit organization that exists to advance the sport of rowing in knoxville tn, and the tennessee river valley. through instruction and the promotion of the health, welfare, and long-term development of its members, the knoxville rowing association seeks to bring athletes of all backgrounds and levels of experience to the sport of rowing.
membership is open to men and women ages 21 and up for both recreational and competitive rowing. we welcome all levels of fitness and you don’t need rowing experience – we just require that you know how to swim. also, we are eager to welcome back people who may have rowed in the past, and want to give it a try again!
