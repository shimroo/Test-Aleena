“the creativity workshop in new york went beyond my expectations both times i took it. it really helped me to listen to my instincts and emotions again and to trust them implicitly. this program is so refreshing and universal. for people who work professionally in creative fields, it brings us back to our source and reminds us to trust our instincts and let them live on the blank page. it would be an excellent addition to any writing or arts program worldwide. i hope to take the workshop again soon. this short 4 day course gave me wonderful ideas and material for new poems and plays.”

"the creativity workshop is a dynamic six-day workshop that combines travel, interactive experiences, and collaboration with other professionals to develop the creative process and encourage innovation. i learned strategies that would spark my students’ innate curiosity. i discovered methods that would inspire them to explore the creative process so they could confidently design engineering projects and engage in experimental design as well as  investigate history using artifacts, maps, and other primary sources. i also explored the rich catalan culture and learned about artists and architects who used creativity and innovation to influence society.
i was inspired to write my fft grant to attend the creativity workshop because i found that my students were afraid to take an active role in how they learned and to think outside the box. an even bigger obstacle was that i was losing my own creativity as a teacher as education becomes focused on high-stakes testing.this workshop helped me get my pedagogical groove back!"
