cigmat stands for center for innovative grouting materials and technology and it is affiliated to the department of civil and environmental engineering at the university of houston.
the center's goals are to foster improved understanding of grouting materials and their applications. also of interest are other competing and complementing materials and technologies to grouting used in construction and rehabilitation of civil infrastructure. it is an integrated inter disciplinary framework, drawing expertise in engineering, science and technology at the university of houston.
recent research innovations include the development of highly sensing chemo-thermo-piezoresistive smart cement, smart grouts and smart drilling fluids with the real-time monitoring system. also a new nondestructive electrical method has been developed to detect and quantify the surface, interface and bulk corrosion in metals and non-metallic construction and insulation materials in-situ real-time based on the changes in the electrical properties.
