            business!

new sales are no longer available!

            this web-site will be up for a limited amount of time for past 
            customers to obtain support, but the web-sites will be fully shut 
            down in the near future.
we thank all customers for

tourney tracker takes 
            the drudgery out of running your office pool for college basketball 
            and other tournaments.  collect entries for your pool 
            quickly and easily using our paper-based and/or web-based entry 
            systems.  let tourney tracker do the math for you with the most 
            advanced scoring system available.  create up to 10 different 
            pool reports with a few clicks of the mouse and distribute them 
            either by paper, by e-mail, or by posting them to our web-site.  
tourney tracker 
            runs on your own computer and requires you to run and publish 
            reports using the program on your pc.  the power of your pc 
            allows for sophisticated bonus scoring and "possibility" reports, 
            computing as many as 32,000 scenarios and reporting accurate 
            statistics regarding who still is in the running to collect 
            tournament prizes.   our entry-net feature allows you to 
            publish your pool's reports directly to our web site for all of your 
            pool participants to see with only a few clicks. 

(note that entry-net supports 
            only one pool per type of tournament at a time per software 
            license and requires yearly renewal.)
buy tourney tracker
            and use year after year as a standalone pool manager on your pc.  
            you only need to renew next year if you wish to use our web-based 
            entry-net features.
