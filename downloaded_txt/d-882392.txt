"a stroll through history"
located in the heart of virginia’s horse country just minutes away from historic civil war sites, you’ll find bull run golf club. our championship golf course is one of the washington, d.c. area’s most outstanding public golf courses. we have lots of awards to our credit: golf magazine named bull run golf club as "the best new public course in 1999; the washington times called us "the best public course in the d.c. area” in 2000; and washington golf monthly named bull run one of "the mid-atlantic’s 100 must-play courses”. the expansive course layout is very secluded, meandering through acres and acres of undeveloped scenic meadows, ponds, and woodlands. this is truly a must-play gem along the "raspberry golf trail".
