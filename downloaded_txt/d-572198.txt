sunset catamaran cruise! oh. my. goodness. this was my absolute favourite thing about my firsttrip to adelaide! my partner and i loved the views of the sunset, the crew was amazing, providing a barand music for all to enjoy. blankets were provided as it got a little chilly. could not recommend enough üôÇthank you, thank you! 








 










 







charmaine russell 







this experience was the best ! a perfect start or end to your day. we chose the sunset cruise and what amagnificent time we had, the afternoon was fuss free easy going, the bar was well stocked and the staffwere great, there was also plenty of room to shelter from the sun if needed. but take a hat slap on somesunscreen and enjoy the view. thinking about it ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶do it ! 








 










 







kate harris 







incredible natural experience with temptation, loved the knowledge they shared about the dolphins. thecrew went out of their way to give us the best interaction with the dolphins and answered any questionswe had about them and their environment! seeing the dolphins was amazing, they swam right underneathus!

laika mudd 







we had a fantastic trip this morning! we saw dolphins and calves and were able to swim up close.fantastic experience and such a privilege to see such phenomenal creatures in their natural habitat. ourguides were very knowledgeable and friendly and able to answer our questions. best activity to do in adelaide hands down! (i‚Äôve done the swimming with dolphins on kangaroo island which was lovely, however would recommend doing this one as when your in the cargo net it allows you to focus on the dolphins) ‚Äì if you haven‚Äôt been ‚Äì go! 








 










 







kim ward 







a must do in adelaide! the crew is incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and focussed on the passenger and the protection of the dolphins in the wild. we swam with 2 species of dolphins from the front and back of the beautiful boat. it was a genuine observation of nature. will definitely do this again when back in adelaide.
