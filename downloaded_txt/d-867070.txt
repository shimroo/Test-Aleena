conservation













the cutthroat chapter of trout unlimited (cctu) regularly undertakes important conservation and habitat improvement projects intended to conserve, protect and restore our fisheries and watersheds. common examples of our members rolling up their sleeves and getting to work include removing trash from local rivers and creeks, clearing out invasive weeds, replanting willows and native plants and grasses, repairing trails and closing improper access routes, and reclaiming abandoned mines or restoring habitat impacted by illegal mining activities. cctu also consistently donates money in support of other cold-water fisheries and habitat improvement programs. join us!
