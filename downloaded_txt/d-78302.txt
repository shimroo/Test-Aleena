                âhe was quite simply the  greatest stand up comedian there ever wasâ

anyone can repeat a rodney dangerfield joke, but no one can tell one quite like the man himself.  in his autobiography, itâs not easy beinâ me, we get a rare glimpse into the events that shaped rodneyâs perspective and propelled his career. if itâs history you want, thatâs a good place to start. 
rodney.com continues on as a tribute to the living philosophy of perhaps the ultimate comedic genius. we had an artistic mastermind, a comedy god, walking among us. the following pages offer a journey into his virtuous mind.
people remember rodney as a regular on variety programs like the tonight show and from a host of sidesplitting movies that incited cult followings. but if you never witnessed rodney perform his opus, his las vegas act, then you missed the definitive comedic event—a contemplative glimpse into the otherwise billowing eyes of this soulful philosopher.
the following reviews of his live shows were those rodney cherished. he could immediately see the writers understood he what he was trying to do on stage, making their accounts essential to the true rodney fan.
later, tom shales of the washington post wrote in rodney’s obituary that “if steinbeck’s tom joad or kafka’s joseph k had been stand-up comics, they might have been something like rodney dangerfield.” he then recanted, “no, waitânot at all. there was only one rodney.”

                    rodney running scaredâ

                how a comic  made a comeback  from nowhere

when he was a child and lost his parents at the beach, he asked a policeman, âdo you think weâll ever find them?â âi donât know,â came the reply. âthereâs so many places they could hide.â
no breaks, no how, no way. his father worked in a bank and got caught stealing pens. research reveals that rodney dangerfield is the sap in his own family tree. the line has never been broken. elevator operators eye him and always say the same thing: âbasement?â on a night out in a chinese restaurant, he opens his fortune cookie and gets the check from the next table. the trauma reaches into the intimate parts of his life. he has become such a maladroit lover that he caught a peeping tom booing him. his wife âcut me down to once a month. iâm lucky. two guys i know she cut out completely.â
the weeks of his life are run-on reminders of his inferiority. no luck. no chance. and of courseâas a connoisseur of the hairsbreadth art of stand-up comedy will tell youâno respect. these components of rodney dangerfieldâs fractured comic mask form one of the unlikeliest success stories around. dangerfield was a has-been even before he was anyone at all.
âi dropped out of show business once,â he often confesses in his act.
                âbut nobody noticed.â
he went into business selling paint, and scribbled jokes between appointments. by the time most businessmen are playing chicken with their first heart attack, rodney was planning his comeback from nowhere. at 45, he made his first appearance on the ed sullivan show. he was 47 when he went on carson for the first of 63 appearances. now, at 58, dangerfield has a rambunctious new comedy album out and his first starring role in a hollywood movie.
in caddyshack, rodney shows up as a real estate developer who dresses in color combinations out of a sherwin-williams sample book and outrages the gentry at the local country club with such reflections as, âyou look at that kid, you know why tigers eat their young.â rodney must compete for attention in the film with alumni of saturday night live and one mechanical gopher. he draws more laughs than the tv kids and chews up at least as much of the screen as the rodent.
dangerfield, who keeps his traveling to a minimum and works as much as possible out of his own club on manhattanâs east side, has put together one of the best comedy acts in the trade by dealing shamelessly in things other comics struggle to hideâlike fear, anger and humiliation. in performance, dangerfield is the enemy of poise.
a minute after he hits the lights, his brow throws off sweat like a lawn sprinkler. his eyes bulge. his hands claw at his throat. he may be trying to loosen his tie, but it looks as if he is trying to strangle himself.
the whole performance is a screwball incarnation of the comedianâs deepest nightmare: flop sweat, the purgatorial feeling of bombing out, when every joke falls like a barbell and the only laughs come when you introduce the band. other guys fight their way past flop sweat, or cool it out. for rodney dangerfield, cool is a dial on a fedders. he sets fear on parade, and all its consequences are his best punch lines.
jack benny once told dangerfield that his signature lineââi donât get no respectââcuts right to everyoneâs soul. indeed, dangerfieldâs best comedy is based on a futile lashing out against misery, often sexual and always social.
âcomedy is essentially mood, not a series of one-liners,â dangerfield says. âevery joke is a complete story.â
the way he tells one, the audience can often see a whole life in a setup, and a fate in a punch line. âduring sex my wife wants to talk to me,â he confesses, then adds: âthe other night she called me from a hotel.â
even dangerfieldâs silliest gags have the sting of truth. how accurate they may be about his own life is another matter. he talks about âcomedic license,â but whether he is doing a shotgun discourse on marriage or about growing up jewish and poor in a subsection of new york city that is well-off and waspy, he seems to be drawing from deep roots. rodney was jacob cohen when the neighborhood kids had names âlike marianne and biff.â when they were on the tennis courts, he was delivering groceries. he started writing gags when he was 15. at 19 he was playing the catskills for $12 a week.
jobs outside the catskills were even harder to come by. he got a spot as a singing waiter at a brooklyn joint called the polish falcon, where the emcee was a woman named sally marr. rodney hung around with her i son, who was in the navy then. he called himself lenny bruce.
if the catskills were the training ground for that time, a broadway drugstore called hansonâs was the laboratory. rodney, lenny and a lot of other young guys hung out in the back booths, nursing coffee, nailing each other with wild ideas, gags, nutty notions for routines. a few made it out of the drugstore. some, like joe ancis, were brilliant in the booth and on the street; bruce once admitted that he owed maybe a third of his act to joe. but ancis trembled before the prospect of flop sweat. he never went onstage. others, like rodney, fought the flops, but never got out quite far enough. when he married singer joyce indig, he was close to 30 and still far from the big time. he worried that long weeks working joints on the road would hurt the marriage. so he packed it in and started selling paint.
during that period, he watched lenny become a storm center, a genius and a martyr. he saw joe ancis go into the construction business. rodney had two children, brian and melanie, but his marriage was rocky and finally fell apart. rodney raised the kids. he also put together a new act and got a taste for a new life. says dangerfield:
âi asked the club owner not to put my name in the paper, to make up another name. when he came up with rodney dangerfield i thought he was crazy, but i was depressed enough to go along with it. i figured, if youâre gonna change your name you
                might as well change it.â
by 1967, he crashed the sullivan show, and by 1969 he had enough mileage behind him to settle down and open a club, from which he has been sallying forth ever since, pretty much at his own pleasure.
rodney says a lot of offers come in now: movies, âdozensâ of tv pilots. his attitude toward them is âi donât want to spend my time poring over scripts and memorizing. when you do standup, you are the guy on. live entertainment is the only real medium.â it is a medium filled with ghosts. you can hear lenny bruce beneath the skin of some of rodneyâs cracks, though dangerfield disclaims any specific influence. both of them share the same manic irreverence, the same compulsive wise-mouthing and fearless telling of truth.
they also shared the same pal, joe ancis, who has been boarding with rodney and his children ever since joe separated from his wife a couple of years back. although rodney occasionally pays $50 for a gag, he cooks up most of his own material, saying what he feels, working the jokes out in front of small audiences until they flow just right. âi play with a joke a long time,â dangerfield admits. âi came up with this one sitting in the sauna at the health club yesterday: âwhen i got married all the property was put in two names. and her motherâs.â â
the hands reach for his throat.
                the eyes bulb out of his face like two christmas ornaments dropped into
                a holiday pudding. âdo you think thatâs funny?â he asks.

                    stage:

                at the hellinger, rodney  dangerfield
                
            



                    by stephen holden, new york times, february 1988
                




at age 66, rodney dangerfield is the youngest older comedian - or might he be the oldest younger comedian? - on the block. whichever, mr. dangerfield, who opened a two-week engagement at the mark hellinger theater on tuesday, is the rare comic whose popularity transcends generations.
in contrast to the mature crowds that flocked to jackie masonâs ââworld according to me!,ââ mr. dangerfieldâs raucous opening-night audience seemed less than half his age.
having discovered the feisty saucer-eyed complainer with his hang-dog expression and pugnacious jaw in such movies as ââcaddyshackââ and ââback to school,ââ this audience greeted him with the sort of enthusiasm normally reserved for respected aging rock stars.
the phenomenon of this veteran comicâs popularity among the young brings up an interesting paradox. to his own generation, his savage, bellowing self-deprecation and wife-bashing have made him something like the male equivalent of phyllis diller or a jackie gleason stripped of innocence and faith. but to those half his age, mr. dangerfieldâs resentful roars mark him as the godfather of the cutting edge of comedy. to them, he is the prototype for hostile rock-influenced ââscreamersââ like sam kinison, to whose career mr. dangerfield has given crucial support.
onstage, mr. dangerfield is a verbal boxer who dances lightly around a theme, then closes in for the kill, delivering a barrage of one- and
                two-line punches in an accelerated rapid-fire delivery that becomes a orgiastic flurry of jabs.
the pleasure in watching mr. dangerfield perform comes more from his delivery than from his material. he never loses his timing as he lands his often smutty punches in a virile drill-instructorâs growl that deepens and expands as the action speeds up.
mr. dangerfieldâs endless jokes about his failing sexual powers, his putdowns of marriage, his reflections on ugliness, obesity and stupidity, may be only slightly more sophisticated than the ââtake my wife, pleaseââ school of stand-up humor out of which he emerged. by injecting it with freewheeling obscenity, he has modernized this school and given the jokes a contemporary immediacy.
mr. dangerfieldâs present pinnacle of popularity makes his patented ââno respectââ shtick, which is no longer the center of his act, ring with a certain irony. if in leaner times he represented a working-class everyman railing against his own ordinariness, today he canât help but look like a winner who commands loads of respect and whose style of combativeness is offered as successful strategy for survival.
in his broadway engagement, mr. dangerfield is sticking to his customarily narrow range of subjects: sex, physical ugliness, more sex, old age, still more sex, drugs and alcohol and yet again more sex.
mr. dangerfieldâs sexual humor can be funny, though it does begin to wear thin after the umpteenth joke about impotence and meager anatomical endowment. it must be said, however, that in the age of the sex therapist, these jokes tap into primal anxieties that are only fed by todayâs sexualized climate. there is finally something liberating about the free-floating hostility in which mr. dangerfield invites his audiences to wallow. in one pithy bit, mr. dangerfield pretends to be flicking a television remote control switch. as an imaginary parade of talking heads rolls by, he lambasts it with contemptuous profanity. âthatâs how i get my hate out,ââ he says. who among us hasnât felt the same disgust while wandering through the video wasteland?â

                    rodney dangerfield,

                beating
                troubles to the
                punch line




                    by tom shales, washington post, october 2004
                





                many labels were hung on rodney dangerfield during
                his long, frenetic heyday as the funniest joke teller in
                america. his was âthe comedy of angst,â or âthe comedy
                of anxiety,â or âthe comedy of the loser.â what it really was
                was the comedy of funny. it was the comedy of laughter.
                his act wasnât conceptual or observational or stream-of-consciousness;
                it was a bunch of jokes.
            

                the jokes tended to be self-deprecating and selfpitying
                and what they said at heart was âweâre all in this
                together.â but weâre not all in it together anymore. rodney
                dangerfield died at 82 tuesday in new york after a long
                series of illnesses and operations.
            

                âi donât get no respectâ was, of course,
                his signature line, but to the end
                he had the respect, and the gratitude,
                of everybody who ever laughed
                so hard they cried.
            

                in the â70s and â80s, dangerfieldâs appearances on âthe
                tonight show with johnny carsonâ were major television
                events, whether in college dorms or, who knows,
                retirement villages. carson loved comedians and found
                rodney so relentless in his pursuit of the ever-elusive
                next laugh that just the idea of dangerfield amused him.
            

                dangerfield would come out from behind the curtain and
                do five or six minutes of prepared material, then sit on
                the couch and do several more minutes of jokes thinly
                disguised as conversation, carson barely getting a word
                in except to set up more jokes. heâd ask dangerfield,
                âhowâs your health?â and dangerfield would do a few
                minutes of health jokes, always involving his physician,
                the mythical âdr. vinnie boom botz,â being referred to of
                late by david letterman on his own show.
            

                he didnât like it when he visited his doctor one time and
                was told he was crazy, dangerfield recalled. âi said, âoh
                yeah? well i want another opinion.â the doctor says,
                âokay â youâre ugly, too.â â
            

                even at the dentistâs he was plagued. âi told my dentist,
                what can i do about having such yellow teeth? he said,
                âwear a brown tie.â â
            

                one night dangerfield tore through his sit-down routine
                so fast that he ended early and so, mopping his brow
                with a handkerchief, no more jokes available, he turned
                to carson and simply asked, âso whatâs new with you?â
                carson laughed so hard at this that he literally fell off his
                chair. they were gorgeous together.
            

                though he had two careers as a
                comedian â the first, as jack roy,
                began at the age of 15 â it was the
                second one, started late in life,
                that made dangerfield a star and,
                in his rumpled black suit,
                solid red tie and unmade bed of
                a face, an american icon.
            

                the success in other peopleâs clubs and on tv enabled
                him to open dangerfieldâs, a homey comedy club on
                manhattanâs east side. dangerfield would roam through
                the crowd in his trademark silk bathrobe, greeting
                guests and watching the new comics. he was infallibly
                generous about giving young talent exposure at his club,
                and on his memorable hbo specials, where roseanne
                barr made her first big splash. he supported one of the
                most audacious and irreverent comics ever, the great
                sam kinison.
            

                dangerfield was thoroughly hip; he âgotâ all the jokes,
                including the ones he didnât tell. he got all the jokes,
                he was all the jokes. never did he break up at his own
                material, though. he was too worried about it. he slaved
                over it â sometimes with co-writers â into the wee hours,
                scribbling jokes on the lined pages of big notebooks.
            

                his huge popularity may have been a reaction to all the
                pseudo-intellectual comics who stood before brick walls
                and talked about their neuroses. dangerfield didnât talk
                about his neuroses; he talked about how little success he
                was having in bed. âi asked one girl if she was going to
                hate herself in the morning. she said, âi hate myself now.â â
            

                or: âi remember one date i had, we ran into some guy
                she knew and she introduced us. she said, âsteve, this is
                rodney. rodney, this is goodbye.â â
            

                eventually he was able to star in such movies as âeasy
                moneyâ and âback to school,â respectably funny if not
                artful comedies, and in âcaddyshack,â now a cult hit so
                beloved that some of its fans know the whole script by
                heart. dangerfield plays a boor, a vulgarian, the ugly
                american. it was a stretch, but he brought it off.
            

                even in his movie roles, the jokes
                were on him â ridiculing the way
                he looked or talked or barged
                through life. he was a study in manic
                misery, hilarious homeliness,
                emmett kelly with a voice.
            

                perhaps if steinbeckâs tom joad or kafkaâs joseph k had
                been stand-up comics, they might have been something
                like rodney dangerfield.
            

                no, wait â not at all. forget that stuff. there was only
                one rodney â one put-upon, perpetually pained, always
                discouraged rodney. if he looked for that famous silver
                living, it would fall out of a cloud and hit him on the head.
                his was a humor that, like so many of the great comics
                of his generation (though his popularity spanned several
                generations), grew out of pain. born jacob cohen, he
                remembered all his life how teachers â not just students,
                but teachers â made anti-semitic remarks about him in
                front of classmates at new yorkâs p.s. 99.
            

                and so he told jokes about being a miserable kid. but not
                about that aspect of being a miserable kid. the anger
                never came out in the comedy â not directly. he was a
                professional joke teller, not a guy looking for psychoanalysis
                from an audience in a nightclub, so you got jokes and gags,
                not anecdotes about the way it really was.
            

                âmy mother had morning
                sickness after i was born,â
                heâd say of his earliest days.
            

                âmy old man didnât help, either. one time i was kidnapped.
                they sent back a piece of my finger. he said he wanted
                more proof!â
            

                âi was lost at the beach once and a cop helped me look
                for my parents. i said to him, âyou think weâll find them?â
                he said, âi donât know, kid. thereâs so many places they
                could hide.â â
            

                thus, according to his act â the way chaplinâs or keatonâs
                or harold lloydâs characters were established â the
                patterns of this rodneyâs ramshackle life were immutably
                established.
            

                âthe other day they asked me to leave a bar i was drinking
                in. they said they wanted to start the happy hour.â
            

                âonce the cops arrested me for jaywalking. the crowd
                shouted, âdonât take him alive!â â
            

                the litany of abuse would be
                punctuated with the occasional âi tell
                ya, i donât get no respect. no respect
                at all.â the crowd would cheer.
            

                and then back to the jokes.
            

                the no-respect theme was encouraged by one of the
                most artful and adored of all stand-ups, jack benny. âhe
                was an ace. he was a doll,â dangerfield recalled in a 1979
                interview. âand he says to me, ârodney, iâm cheap and
                iâm 39, thatâs my image, but your âno respectâ thing, thatâs
                into the soul of everybody. everybody can identify with
                that. everyone gets cut off in traffic, everyone gets stood
                up by a girl, kids are rude to them, whatever.â he says to
                me, âevery day something happens where people feel
                they didnât get respect.â â
            

                no matter how dangerfield complained onstage about
                how life treated him, the comic never exploited it for
                pathos or poignancy. still, there was just a trace of it in a
                soliloquy in which he talked about the fact that nobody
                ever gave him âone of these,â and made the âokayâ
                sign, the little circle, with his thumb and finger. so if you
                saw him in the street after the show or in a club later or
                anywhere, he would tell an audience, it would be doing
                him a great service just to flash him âone of these.â
            

                he figured it wasnât much to ask. âyou know what the
                trouble with me is? i appeal to everyone who can do me
                absolutely no good,â heâd mockingly lament. âat my age,
                if i donât drink, donât smoke, and eat only certain foods,
                what can i look forward to? from this point on, if i take
                excellent care of myself â iâll get very sick and die.â
            

                and so he did.
            

                but he left behind infinite echoes
                of laughter, laughter that survives
                somehow even if it appears to have
                evaporated. and who knows but
                that right now, at this very moment,
                someone, somewhere is giving
                rodney âone of these.â

10 things to know


01
born jacob cohen on november 22, 1921 in babylon, long island to hungarian jewish immigrant parents.


02
offstage, rodney was nothing like his hapless comedic persona. he was a loving husband, father and mentor.


03
his first distinctive joke set-up was ânothing goes right.â


04
some chatty mob guys were the unintended inspiration for his signature catchphrase, âi donât get no respect.â rodney overheard them talking about respectâduring one of his showsâand it was a eureka moment for him.


05
rodney gave many comedians early breaks, including jim carrey, tim allen, roseanne barr, jerry seinfeld, and sam kinison.


06
a black suit with a red tie was rodneyâs signature getup. one of his outfits is part of the permanent collection at the smithsonian museum in washington, d.c.


07
he was nicknamed rodney dangerfield by a club owner who, on rodneyâs request, introduced him as someone other than jack roy.


08
in 1995, the academy of motion picture arts and sciences denied rodney entry. after an exceptionally loud outcry by fans, the academy reversed their decision and offered membership to him, which he then declined.


09
his first las vegas appearance was at the sands hotel, opening for dionne warwick.


10
rodney held many odd jobs as a teenager, including selling ice cream on the beach, delivering groceries, taking care of a newsstand, working at a soda fountain, barking for the theater, and driving a fish truck.

115my wife has a temper. the other night she was yelling, âyouâre an animal, youâre an animalâ. so i took a leak in the living room and i told her, from now on, thatâs my territory.
            







116my doctor told me heâll have me on my feet in two weeks. he was right. i got his bill; i had to sell my car.
            







117i saw one place that had a sign âpop was bottomlessâ. i went inside, there was no one there.
            







118i told my wife, how come when we kiss, your eyes are always open? she told me she was on the lookout for her boyfriend.
            







119i bought a waterbed. i went to grab my wife; she had drifted away.
            







120i asked my wife last night, âwere you faking it?â she said, âno, i was really sleeping.â
            







121iâm not a sexy guy. my wedding night, my wife said, âthis is it!â i told her, âhoney, that was it.â
            







122my wife canât cook at all. i got the only dog who begs for alka-seltzer.
            







123last night i had a dream. i took a walk down memory lane. and my wife was working it.
            







124my wife and i, are you kidding? our relationship is on and off. every time i get on, she tells me to get off.
            







125i went back to my hometown, to visit all my ex-schoolteachers. all i had to make was one stop â the cemetery.
            







126when i go to a nude beach, i always take a ruler with me. in case i have to prove something.
            







127i never had any luck with a nude beach. i went to a nude beach; they kicked me out. they said itâs impolite to point.
            







128well that was a wild beach. the day i was there they had a wedding. a wedding on a nude beach; everyone knew who the best man was, you know?
            







129i said to a girl, come on honey, iâll show you where itâs at. she said, you better. last one couldnât find it.
            







130i was making love to a girl. i told her, youâre so flat chested. she said, get off my back.
            







131when i was a kid, everyone thought i got plenty of girls. iâd go to a drive in movie and do push-ups in the backseat of my car.
            







132my wife told me to go to hell. i told her, youâre too late, iâm there already.
            







133my wife and i, we donât think alike. i mean, she donates money to the homeless and i donate money to the topless.
            







134my wife, she keeps me in line. no matter how many guys are ahead of me.
            







135when i was a kid, my parents went shopping. they always took me with them, ya know. that way they could park in the handicap section.
            







136what a childhood i had. when i took my first step, my old man tripped me.
            







137one time my whole family played hide and seek. yeah, they found my mother in pittsburg.
            







138my doctor told me to watch my drinking. now i drink in front of a mirror.
            







139i drink too much, way too much. my doctor drew blood. he started to run a tab.
            







140iâm getting old. iâve got no sex life. i get tired just holding up the magazine.
            







141at my age, i want to get sex over quickly. then i can take my nap.
            







142i tell you, iâm not a sexy guy. i was a centerfold for playboy magazine; the staples covered everything.
            







143a lot of girls turn me down, you know? one girl turned me down. she told me she had to go to work in the morning. i told her iâd be finished by then.
            







144i tell you, this girl was fat. when she walks backward, she starts beeping. i mean fat; i hit her with my car. she told me why donât you go around me. i told her i didnât have enough gas.
            







145i know the best way to get girls. i hang out at womenâsâ prisons and wait for the parolees.
            







146last week i noticed my gums were shrinking. i was brushing my teeth with preparation h.
            







147my wife, she loves vacations. last night she told me, âi wanna go someplace iâve never been before.â i took her to a menâs room.
            







148i know how to satisfy my wife in bed; i leave.
            







149when we got married, my wife told me i was one in a million. i found out she was right.
            







150last night i came home, i picked up the extension. my wife was talking to some guy on the phone. i told the guy, âdonât let her fool you. sheâll fake it!â
            







151when i was a kid, we were poor. we were so poor when my father died, they asked my mother, âplastic or paper?â
            







152i was poor. i used to go to orgies to eat the grapes.
            







153people say fish is good for a diet. but fish should never be cooked in water. fish should be cooked in its natural oils: texaco, mobil...
            







154hey, iâm trying a new diet.  the diet is viagra and prune juice.  now i donât know if iâm coming or going.
            







155girls, they donât think right. i had a date with a girl; she had mirrors all over her bedroom. she told me to come over and bring a bottle; i got windex.
            







156my wife was never nice. on our first date, i asked her if i could give her a goodnight kiss on her cheek. she bent over.
            







157hey, you wanna have laughs? do what i do. when i go through a tollbooth, i tell the guy, the car behind meâs paying for two.
            







158i had a good time last week. the end of the show, the whole audience was midgets. i tell ya, i got a standing ovation and i didnât even know it.
            







159just remember, a crowded elevator smells different to a midget.

rodney's collected papers

the comedic genius that transpired onstage was due in no small part to careful planning behind the scenes.
before nearly every appearance, rodney would sit down with pen and paper to outline the material he planned to cover. sometimes he took days to organize his thoughts, creating pages and pages of jokes, much of which is seen here.
rodney saved all of his notes, opening a rare window into the workings of his mind. his creative process is on display here for the first time and is shown with other notable ephemera from rodneyâs collection. please enjoy and come back again as we'll unveil new material from time to time.












jack roy, page 1 of 3
            perhaps rarest of all are the typed pages of rodneyâs first attempt at his act as jack roy. the evolution of not just rodneyâs performance style but his approach to preparation is evident here.
        








jack roy, page 2 of 3








jack roy, page 3 of 3









the catskills
            before rodney was rodney, he was jack roy, a struggling comedian trying to make it in the business. he put in long hours preparing and even longer hours traveling to any club that would have him on stage. this bit of material was for a gig he was trying in the catskills, before he had developed his âact.â
        









sullivan try
            rodney tested his jokes at local clubs before including them in his stand up show. check marks indicate jokes he tried that were working, while asterisks indicated the new ones. he would record the jokes to judge the laughter, deciding later which to keep, which to retry, and which to toss out.
        









the steve allen show, march 7, 1968
            when it came to planning his shows, rodney wasnât all jokes. he sometimes wrote himself fashion advice (âwear long dark socksâ) or directional cues (âwalk to your markâ). these types of comments are frequent in his earlier years and less so later on, perhaps owing to experience and familiarity with his routine.
        









the joey bishop show, august 1968
            rodney was such a beloved guest on the joey bishop show, that they booked him every night for a week in august of 1968. this is the first of his prep notes for a weekâs worth of material.
        









the merv griffin show, june 1968, page 1 of 3
            rodney graced the stage of the merv griffin show more than 40 times in his career. on this evening, his 28th appearance on the show, he performed a stand-up routine and spent some time conversing with merv from the couchâa segment rodney referred to as âthe panel.â

            rodney made multiple appearances on the dick cavett show during its run from 1968-74. the notes seen here are from an october episode thought to have aired early in his career. he begins with the opening question, âhow do you do?â later, he would change his opener to, âwhat a crowd, what a crowd. iâm all right now but last week i was in rough shape,â a line his loyal fans adored.
        









the david frost show, october 29 1969, page 1 of 4
            for his third appearance on the david frost show, rodney penned three pages of notes. in 1969, he was still using the âhow do you do?â opener. he used the same format at the microphone as he did on the couch, often cracking up his hosts when they were supposed to be asking him questions.

the mike douglas show, june 30, 1972, page 1 of 3
            for the mike douglas show, rodney performed stand up and chatted from the couch, just as on mervâs show. by the 1970s, he was getting quite comfortable with the variety show format, yet never complacent with his material and planning.

blue note
            you could often tell when rodney was in a big hurry to get his ideas on paper. his handwriting appeared near illegible to anyone but him and he strayed from the usual template when planning a televised show.
        









the tonight show with jay leno, march 24, 1995
            rodney used the same note-taking system for more than 40 years. he would switch pens and use a heavier mark for the punch lines and key words, to stay focused.
        









the tonight show with jay leno, august 30, 1997
            rodneyâs career spanned multiple hosts of the tonight show. his final appearances on the late-night staple were with jay leno, whom he remained friends with until his death. in 2009, jay credited rodney as the inspiration for the style of jokes he frequently told on his show.
        









the tonight show, november 21, 2000, page 1 of 2
            this note, marked âpanel nov 21 40th spotâ is from one of his later appearances on the tonight show. even as new forms of comedy were gaining popularity among youthful viewers, rodney still amused as a one-liner comic of the old school, doing his best work in front of live audiences.

stains on a note
            comedy is an art form without a weekend. and as such, rodney was always âon.â on any given day, you might find handwritten notes strewn about his home with raw material for his next act. here, he noted he liked the expression âthe cool side of the pillow,â and thought he might use it in a joke. he never did.
        









hotels
            being in the âbusiness,â rodney spent a fair amount of time in hotel rooms and casinos. in this particular note he laments, âi can always tell how well iâm doing by the hotel iâm staying at.â though he wrote numerous rough lines about his travels, his act never strayed too far from what workedâhis wife, his dog, and his lack of respect.
        









unknown internet magazine
            rodney gave many interviews over his lifetime. some in person, and others via the question-and-answer method seen in this interview for an online magazine. though undated is likely from the early 1990s. clearly, his signature irreverent style still shone brightly in his later years.
        









rodney knows best
            in 2002, rodney received this letter regarding the use of medical marijuana. and though it needs no explanation, itâs worth noting that it came shortly after he was lectured for smoking pot while in an l.a. hospital. it would seem that after all the fuss, rodney finally got the respect he deservedâat least from his doctor.
