 baezfred posted a comment on an event: mt hayes via centennial trail


			                        if anyone is staying overnight with bob on saturday night, would you be interested in doing a small hike on sunday before heading home? i can post indian head and lunch in lincoln. normally you might not travel this far north for such a small hike, but if you're already here, why not do the hike (which won't take long), have a quick lunch then head home? call it a 2 for 1 deal!
