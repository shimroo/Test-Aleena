private dining room
the second floor private dining room is our most intimate and secluded private event space, located in the back of our second floor. the room has capacity for 40 guests for a seated lunch or dinner, or 50 guests for a standing reception. the room has a ceiling height of 12 feet, highlighted by three large skylights that bring in plentiful natural light during the day. ambient noise level is low to moderate, as the private dining room also contains its own bar and music controls. it is our recommended space for smaller meetings, seated dinners, business lunches, presentations or lectures, and the perfect room for controlled-access fundraisers and media events. the room can be set in many different arrangements; ask our event manager if you have specific set up needs and we will do our best to honor them.
