i had a brand new perfectly working key. i can't believe my good fortune with this (previous repairs via ebay have been lacklustre at best). i will be buying another one for sure. cheers and merry christmas 🙂paul harward1731878118remote key has provided me with a new 10as alarm module for my land rover defender.i can only say that the experience was nothing but positive from start to finish.my initial enquiry was dealt with swiftly and after sending my unit to ian via registered mail he phoned me to provide a detailed analysis of the state of my unit prior to repair and the same day in its arrival at his address.after a friendly chat with lots of advice from ian a decision was made to replace my unit with a new one.ian confirmed that he would start building the unit straight away and it arrived at my door before 1pm the next day!!what a brilliant service!!all fitted as per ian’s advice and my land rover is back working with new key fobs and it’s like a new car again. it even seems to starts better!an excellent service provided which meant a stress free repair.a five star service with a product which far exceeds the original manufacturers standards and a guarantee that my land rover will at least have an alarm, remote locking and central locking for at least 20 more years of motoring.thankyou!!phil woodhouse1731324055i purchased a key and programmer, followed enclosed instructions which were easy to follow, worked first time.. great service.patrick hughes1731070903thank you worked as said easypatrick moynihan1729510483i have no idea how it works but work it most

bednarz1725565693grant gibson1725207023joel challis1724277719it's not often i leave reviews but if a company does an outstanding job then i will.i ordered a replacement keyfob one afternoon for an old 2003 mg zr with a programmer that comes with a self addressed postage paid envelope to return it. it arrived the next morning, so i followed the simple instructions and plugged it into the obd port. 20 seconds later the light went out and i tried the fob - it worked. immobiliser, everything. the old fob still works too. all done for a very reasonably price in my opinion.overall, spot on company and will definitely use again.henry l1723615989ian provided an exceptional customer experience, even all the way out here to me in australia - i had some trouble pairing the fob to my defender after i bought the wrong frequency fob, but ian talked me through it and even refunded my incorrect purchase too. can't recommend ian enough - the diy programmer and cut-by-photo service is flawless!david sanders1723444550thoroughly recommended, excellent customer service, fast turnaround repair services.5*jochem wubs1723264835my renault master had problems with the immobilzer, unfortunately precisely when we wanted to go on a holiday. remote key helped us get the van moving again and saved our holiday.frank mcpartland1723216927new fob for my defender 90 - i was very impressed in how easy it was to

clean1716571154as far as product goes, great. unfortunately, in my experience, the customer service was simply poor, not a single reply at all. for that reason i can not give 5 stars. if you have an immobiliser issue it’s likely these guys can sort it. however not receiving any reply or acknowledgement is not 5 start service. solid 4 stars.stephan1714394660the immobilizer broke on my renault master. replacement keys are no longer available because the car is too old. i found the 'remote key' service online. i provided the supplementary key number and received the immobiliser bypass (pin
