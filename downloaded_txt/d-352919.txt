dental amalgam compliance and regulations



amalgam separators and cartridges


drna's amalgam separators and its line of generic cartridges satisfy all local, state, and federal regulations for amalgam disposal and recycling. furthermore, the drna generic 1 cartridge was successfully tested using the solmetex® hg5® (legacy) amalgam separator unit and met the iso 11143:2008 standard.



drna generic cartridge 1 is compatible with the solmetex® hg5® (legacy) amalgam separator unit.
epa regulation requires cartridge replacement every year or once sediment reaches the fill line, whichever occurs sooner.
drna makes replacement easy and hassle-free with on demand pick-up, recycling, and documentation included!





scrap amalgam handling, collection and recycling


drna’s all-inclusive amalgam recycling service ensures that your office is able to effectively manage all materials that fall under the category of “scrap amalgam.”
