the wall usa is no longer allowing comments to be added on individual pages. we have been running this website for close to 20 years and we are unable to keep up the work any more. the wall usa will still be here and running as always and none of the information will be lost.thanks for your understanding.






     "if you are able, save for them a place inside of you and save one backward glance when you are leaving for the places they can no longer go.
              be not ashamed to say you loved them, though you may or may not have always. take what they have taught you with their dying and keep it with your own.
             and in that time when men decide and feel safe to call the war insane, take one moment to embrace those gentle heroes you left behind.
