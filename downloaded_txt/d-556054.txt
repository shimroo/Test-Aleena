tampa computer repair and computer service





computer repair and service is a necessity in almost every business. but it doesn't have to be a costly necessity. we offer service plans that make computer service a controlled expense, using a mixture of remote support (saves travel time and hourly expense) and software tools (spyware, hardware monitoring and antivirus software). when a business is under a service contract with us, you will just need to make a call or email request and we can fix most problems without coming to your location. the only time remote support doesn't work is if the computer in question has a virus, no internet connection or cannot boot up.our technicians are certified to work on dell, toshiba, gateway, ibm, compaq, hp (hewlett packard), sony and many other popular brands. we specialize in laptop / notebook repair for dell, hp and toshiba, as well as other popular manufacturers. our tech's can repair hardware, replace hardware, upgrade pc and laptop components, remove spyware or viruses, setup data backup, reset lost password and much more.the following operating systems are supported by all of our technicians microsoft windows 98, windows 2000, windows xp, windows vista and windows 7.0, as well as all office versions and other popular windows software. we cover all of tampa bay including brandon, clearwater, st. petersburg, largo, palm harbor, carrollwood, citrus park and surrounding cities.
