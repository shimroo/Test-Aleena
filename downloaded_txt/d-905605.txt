dr. hussain saved my life. i am here today because of him. i have been under his care for over 4 years since my heart attack. dr. hussain and staff at florida cardiology are very friendly and caring. wait times are very short. i think the longest i have ever waited is about 15 minutes and that i think is rare. dr hussain has a never quit attitude. he shared a story about saving a patent that i think most would have given up on. he is the best of the best. thank you dr. hussain.– michael lisefski 







dr torres was a god send to us when my husband needed cardiac care while were on vacation from ohio, he made us feel comfortable from the minute we met him. he listened to our concerns and even did the procedure at the facility we preferred. i wish we could take him back to ohio with us!!– sarah and jerry koenig​ 







most proactive cardiologist i have ever met! the entire office team is outstanding. i will never regret leaving my former cardiologist for dr. bajaj. his ideas and procedures have changed my life physically for the better 200%.– vitals review​
