what a year!



    just under 400 days ago, on behalf of the entire gmt and worldtempus teams, i had the pleasure of wishing you a wonderful new year. in the grand scheme of things, 400 days is both a blink of an eye and a significant passage of time – especially when compared to the 400-year history of watchmaking.
