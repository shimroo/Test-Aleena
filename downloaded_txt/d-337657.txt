 protean logic's tickit62 - this
was a major focus by
undergraduate student locksley haynes during the fall, '97 semester.
locksley was funded and the materials he used were made possible by a
grant from the xerox corporation.


the tiny tiger - this appears
to be an extremely powerful processor.  this effort was undertaken by
undergraduate student krystal donald during the fall, '97 semester.

use of a pc printer port for control and data acquisition - volume 2
volume 2 is a follow on effort by undergraduate electrical engineering
students towanda malone, christine samuels and paul roach and myself.
this became known as the rochanda project, where rochanda is a
concatenation of roach, christine and towanda.  as you might guess, the
name rochanda was towanda's idea!
