stabilize temperature, gain precision.air temperature control to 0.008 p-v (± 0.004) °c.




    start here: for turnkey climate-control system.
  

praecis environment:ultra-precision, total climate control.


when it comes to the requirements for environmental control, no two applications are the same. we design custom solutions to match our client's unique needs.a praecis system can maintain a critical point anywhere within the enclosure to the following:air temperature to ± 0.004 °c.humidity to ± 0.1% rh.iso cleanroom standard 14644-1 down to class 1.pressure to ± 1 pa.praecis delivers complete turnkey systems. our systems do not require user interaction and will operate indefinitely without adjustment. if there is a significant change in the operating conditions or ambient variables, praecis can monitor and adjust the system control software from our headquarters.




    start here: for air temperature control only.
  

praecis atcu:ultra-precision air temperature control.


thermal expansion is the single largest source of error in precision manufacturing. precision requires good thermal management.the core of the praecis environment system is the praecis air temperature control unit (atcu). the praecis atcu maintains air temperature stability up to ± 0.004 °c at the critical point over a range of ambient conditions.













præcis uses a laminar-flow air shower to hold the temperature at the critical point.










in the above example, the praecis system maintained a temperature ratio of 150:1 (room temperature and critical point). the blow up shows a period of ten hours with no disturbances—the praecis atcu maintained the critical point temperature to within 0.002 °c.
