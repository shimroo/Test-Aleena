artist: scherer/battencategories: melodicrock classics labelmelodicrock classics dives back into the original melodicrock records catalogue for the fourth time to reissue an album long out of print, but still in high demand.

11. all roads 04:47
 
cd2:
01. sound of your voice (rough mix)
02. dreaming with my eyes wide open (demo)
03. rough diamond (rough mix)
04. what do you really think (demo)
05. space and time (rough mix)

09. in my lifetime (writing demo)
10. change everything (writing demo)(from mrcd9)
11. blue letter (‘the blue letter breakdown’)(from mrr100)
 
 
‘battlezone’ features material exclusively from the jim peterik (ex-survivor, pride of lions, the ides of march) songbook. featuring 8 rare musical gems from jim’s songwriting vault, the album also features 3 brand new tracks, written for this project.
 
that’s 11 new classic songs, produced by jim peterik and featuring the impressive lineup of:
 
all lead vocals: marc scherer
all lead guitars: jennifer batten
backing vocals: marc scherer, bill champlin, bryan cole, brian hemstock, danette pahl
alternate lead and rhythm guitars: jennifer batten, mike aquino, dave carl, jim peterik
bass guitars: bill syniar, klem hayes
keyboards: jim peterik, christian cullen, chris neville, barb unger
drums: dave kelly, ed breckenfeld
sax: mindi abair
 
additional credits include:
executive producer: danette pahl
engineered by: larry millas
mastered by: larry millas at world stage studios and jk northrup at alien productions
mixed by: jim peterik and larry millas
keyboard programming: larry millas and christian cullen
art direction and cover art: nello dell'omo
 
jim peterik comments: “as a long-time enthusiast of marc scherer's vocal chops and the expertise of rock guitar goddess jennifer batten, you can imagine how excited i am at the release of scherer/ batten ‘battlezone’ album. as a song writer and producer, it was a dream come true mining some lost gems from my many years in rock, producing them to a new lustre and even writing three brand new cuts with marc and jennifer - cuts deep, the harder i try and the title track battlezone.
andrew mcneice and danette pahl of melodic rock records gave me the artistic leeway and financial support to create the album of a lifetime.
working with one of the best engineers in the business, larry millas, and musicians like multiple grammy award winner bill champlin of chicago, bassist bill syniar (formerly of survivor), mike aquino (guitarist and singer from world stage), and two-time grammy nominated saxophonist, mindi abair, along with dave kelly and bryan cole, brought depth and texture to the tracks that is palpable.
you can hear our excitement in every song. i guess you can see i'm pumped.
i dare you to crank up battlezone or tender fire or crazy love and not rediscover why you fell in love with melodic rock in the first place. i double dare ya!!”
 
jennifer batten: “it was such a pleasure to jump into such a high-level inspiring project!  marc’s vocals are out of this world, the grooves are kickin’, and working with jim peterik is so joyous and creative. i can’t wait to take this to the stage!”
 
and finally, the vocalist fronting this extraordinary project, marc scherer: “even something as innocuous as lunch with jim peterik can inspire great things…
it was during one such meeting that jim and i conceived of an album showcasing his lost musical treasures. thanks to the contributions of long-time peterik enthusiast and personal friend danette pahl, we now have lift-off!
while the brain trust of talent surrounding jim enhances any idea, this album is extra special because it features a collaboration with one of the world’s greatest guitarists, jennifer batten – who played three world tours with michael jackson and two with jeff beck. they say you know when it’s right in the first 30 seconds, but in this case, you can sense the magic in the first few notes. battlezone blends the songwriting craftsmanship and storytelling genius of jim peterik with the artistry of some of the most amazing musicians in the business. as jennifer observed, the battle can be internal: the fight to be better, to raise the bar and challenge yourself while stirring the musical cauldron. i truly believe that we have captured lightning in a bottle and i’m so eager for everyone to share in this experience.”
 
scherer/batten ‘battlezone deluxe edition’ will be released via melodicrock classics on cd & digital july 26.

van stephenson 'same pen, different voices' arrives july 26 on mrc


artist: van stephensonthe arrival of any new van stepheson music is met with huge anticipation. this release is just a little different from the norm, but no less exciting or musically brilliant.
 
this is van stephenson, but with a little help from his friends.
 
as most will be aware, over the course of the last couple of years, i have been archiving van’s vast collection of unreleased songs and demos. there are more than 500, covering all styles from 70s singer/songwriter, 80s aor and pop to 90s country…and then some.
 
the ultimate goal is to pay tribute to van with some form of all-inclusive box set/s. during the course of sorting the archives into categories, a certain number of tracks were found to feature vocalists other than van. i decided that the box sets should be dedicated to just van with his songs, so the idea came to put together a separate release that featured these songs - van’s own or co-written demos and the various vocalists used on those original sessions.
 
hence the title – ‘same pen, different voices’.
 
and while van’s voice may be absent from this release – his spirit and his style are all over it, with some absolute melodic classics about to be launched. this is a double disc of lost van stephenson tunes written with many of his regular writing partners such as dave innis, sam lorber, robert white johnson, bob farrell and dave robbins.
 
but that isn’t all. lost among the hundreds of songs were a set of session tracks written with dann huff for the classic giant ‘time to burn’ album. one of those songs has already been featured on the ‘van’s versions’ release (‘get over it’), but i’m excited to announce the others will all make their debut on this release and they all feature the voice of dann huff himself.
 
three of these tracks have never been released before and i must thank dann for his co-operation in this release and allowing the tracks to finally see the light of day.
 
they may have been lost for 30 years, but they are magnificent!
 
it doesn’t stop there – there is a trilogy of songs co-written with jaime kyle (previously released), two featuring vocalist robert white johnson and another featuring tj seals, son of dan seals.
 
sadly, we couldn’t ask van himself about the details behind these songs, so many are still missing credits and even the vocalists themselves are unknown in many cases. i have managed to fill in the details behind some of them thanks to the co-writers, but to all those that are featured on the songs – thank you for adding your talents to van’s legacy and please know that the performances delivered some 20-30 years ago now live on today and sound as good as ever.
 
disc 1 is all male lead vocals; disc 2 is mostly female lead vocals.
 
van stephenson – same pen, different voices 2cd set will be released by melodicrock classics july 26.
 
the debut of the rocking giant demo ‘holding on for dear life’ will happen this saturday on steve price’s rock show on arfm – tune in via www.arfm.co.uk
the song will be launched online here next week.
 
the awesome cover art is the brainchild of arnaud leger.

rio 'dangerzone' out june 30 - the bands second album repackaged & remastered


artist: riocategories: melodicrock classics labelpre-order now: https://melodicrockclassics.com/rio-dangerzone.html
 
melodicrock classics continues their partnership with acclaimed british melodic rock band rio for the release of their second album – now presented with a new title and brand-new artwork – both driven by the band’s vision for what the second album should have looked like when originally released.
the band’s steve rodford sets the record straight: “we are finally be able to address the dreadful original album cover and name.  titled ‘sex crimes’, this was our 2nd and last album for music for nations and the fact that elektra records in the states (who had licenced the first album from mfn) hadn’t taken up the option of a 2nd album, meant the budget for this album was nowhere near what we had for ‘borderland’.  when it came to the cover art, the label had gone ahead and designed it without consulting us, and it was quite a shock to see they’d gone with a topless woman with angel wings and a whip!  it all felt so seedy and we both hated it. then they told us there was no budget left to re-design it!  so it feels so good to be able to finally re-package the whole thing in a much cooler way, and also with a new name, both of us feeling that ‘dangerzone’ is a better and more representative lead track for the record.  finally, to have the whole thing re-mastered is a real joy, getting it in a better place sonically rounds things off perfectly.”
 
so with that said, rio ‘dangerzone’ will be released by mrc june 30, with new artwork from the band completed off by resident designer nello dell’omo and remastered by jk northrup.
 
track listing:
01. pay for love
02. under pressure
03. atlantic radio
04. highschool rock
05. guilty
06. when the walls come down
07. danger zone
08. sex crimes
09. dirty movies
10. bad blood
 
bonus tracks:
11. atlantic radio (original demo)
12. guilty (original demo)
13. pay for love (original demo)

‘most wanted’ was a 1986 covers album the band recorded for fun. it was released on lp but isn’t part of the cd re-issue series.

about the muggs:
the muggs aka "the mugleston family band", the muglestons, the muggs...
a family that started out as a small musical trio in 1963 ages 6 to 9 years old. bob (the oldest) playing an accordion, desiree (the only sister) on the piano, and blaine on the drums. the younger siblings troy and lance joined the band as they got a little older 5 and 3 years, adding the charm of this group of kids on the stage. their journey took them on a 24-year fun ride playing shows across the us, canada, saudi arabia, caribbean as a show band, opening for numerous headliners in the casino showrooms and at state fairgrounds across the land.
 
their love for harmonies and writing songs came from the many hours spent at the piano with "uncle jim hickman", the barbershop chorus director who came to the house every monday night in the young years of the muggs. the recording career started in 1972-73 with their first album "little red school house", followed by the 1977 album "the muglestons".
 
working on their song writing skills and making music became one of their favorite things to do when not on the road. in 1983 "subject of assault" was filled with originals, 1985 "rockin in the midnight light" led to their last two albums as a group. a home studio recorded album of songs performed on stage for their fans wanting to capture the performance 1986 "the muggs live" and an all original album in 1988 "touche". we are looking forward to sharing the three original albums again with our fans and some new listeners.
 
lance mugleston, the guitar man, continued to write and record albums after the muggs came to an end in 1992. "carousel" and "while the giant sleeps" are both albums that are timeless and great albums.
 
enjoy the music.
 
subject of assault, rockin the midnight light and touche are all released may 31 on melodicrock classics.

about big game:
 
big game is the recording project launched by mid-west guitarist, singer/songwriter john mcafee in the summer of 1995 after leaving his former band “the affair” (mind dust records) of 11 years where he paid his dues playing as many as 300 dates a year recording and touring extensively in the u.s.a., canada, and abroad (richard josef soviet glastnost tour 1989) receiving mtv and radio airplay. john was also an endorsing artist for ghs strings, washburn guitars, evans guitar products, and laney amplification.
on drums and backing vocals, john’s long-time friend, former band mate and future brother–in-law sid sidall (the affair, shyster, classic iv). sid’s showmanship and technical finesse was the heart of this red-blooded american rock & roll band. sid was also known for his work in radio as program director for toledo’s rock station wiot fm 104.
bass guitar duties are provided by nep sindel (vxn a.k.a. edwin dare, d.e.z., wolfgang, gunnar ross). nep’s reputation as an accomplished bassist and songwriter is well known in the detroit area, and not only confirms his maturity as a pocket groove player, but also in his contributions as a performer and songwriting team player.
last but certainly not least on guitars and vocals is dan strickland (d.e.z., wolfgang). dan’s extensive musical background and classical training often fuels his creative fire as a soloist and songwriter.  a multi-instrumentalist, dan’s use of musical textures adds to the identifiable edge and energy of the band, which is undeniable on tracks like “the assassin” and instrumental “goin off”.
this lineup produced an original 5 song ep released in 1996. with 12 other songs that never made it past the demo stage and live performance, the band went on to headline regional shows and provide support for acts like the spin doctors, vince neil, .38 special and more until the turn of the decade.
 
big game is released via melodicrock classics may 31.

chris antblad – collected works vol. one, 6cd set due march 29 on mrc


artist: chris antbladcategories: melodicrock classics labelpre-order now: https://melodicrockclassics.com/chrisantblad.html
 
melodicrock classics is thrilled to reunite with an old friend – swedish singer/songwriter chris antblad – for a 6cd box set ‘collected works, volume 1’, a limited edition (500 units) set, which takes in 6 of chris’ studio albums from recent years, all previously only available via streaming and digital outlets.
this is chris antblad’s first physical cd release since ‘a new dawn’ in 2012.
chris first worked with mrc’s andrew mcneice for the release of his debut solo album ‘century’, back in 2011.
 
this limited box set captures 6 acclaimed albums, plus several bonus tracks, exclusive for this release.
 
available for pre-order now, ‘collected works volume 1’ will be released march 29 on melodicrock classics.
 
about chris antblad:
chris antblad was a big part of the songwriting and vocal talent behind the spin galley release ‘standing tall’, which came out on atenzia records in 2004.
that's just the start - chris antblad has spent the better part of his adult life as a musician and primarily as a songwriter. a mix of versatility and exceptional lyricism, has led to many interesting collaborations over the years. primarily, the songwriting has been concentrated on adult oriented rock music and country. two styles of music that both are reliant on advanced vocal-parts and arrangements.
after a few years of songwriting, the necessity for good demos fostered a vocal ability that in later years led to more and more vocal work. growing up outside the swedish music scene, there was little to choose from, in terms of vocalists, and necessity once again turned out to be the mother of invention. he was forced to learn the art of singing, and after a couple of uncomfortable years, he found himself a decent singer. combined with the experience as a session keyboard player, with a lot of jazz under the belt, and decent abilities on guitar and bass, the quality of the work started to reach a professional level.
the songwriting led to nashville and collaborations with some of his heroes like john bettis, gary baker, eric martin, paul carrack, michael jay, joe lynn turner, john capek, randy goodrum, jay graydon, brett james and wayne kirkpatrick. his interest for aor always lingered as a result of growing up in the 80-ies and has led to a long-time collaboration with joe lynn turner and a few noted appearances, one of which was the noted one-off spin gallery project.

avion finally gets official cd release via mrc february 23


artist: avioncategories: melodicrock classics labelmelodicrock classics kicks off their 2024 release schedule with some long-awaited gems, starting with four new titles on february 23.
 
to start, mrc is thrilled to partner with randall waller to bring fans the first ever official cd releases from the classic aussie melodic rock band avion.
 
avion’s two acclaimed studio albums: ‘avion’ (1983) and ‘white noise’ (1986) have both been the subject of bootlegs but have never had an official cd release.
in addition to the two studio albums, avion released an independent live album on cassette only in 1987 and that too is now going to find its way to cd a part of this reissue series.
 
all 3 cds are remastered by jk northrup from the best available master sources and will feature non-album singles and b-sides as bonus tracks.
 
check out randall’s brand-new solo album ‘more’ at: https://randallwaller.bandcamp.com/album/more
 
about avion:
avion's lead guitarist and lead singer, randall waller had previously released two albums as a solo artist, oasis (1978) and midnight fire (1980). in 1981 waller formed pop rock group lionheart in sydney with evan murray on keyboards, martyn toole on guitar, and his two brothers: john waller on drums and kendall waller on bass guitar - the group was soon renamed as avion.
avion signed with rca records and, in september 1983, released their debut self-titled album, mixed by bob clearmountain at the power station recording studio in nyc. the album spawned three singles, "i need you" (march 1983), "diamond eyes" (september) and "never let me go" (october).
in august 1984 the group issued a non-album single, "still the night". paul gannell replaced toole on guitar and, in september 1985, released "we've got secrets" on rca. in 1986, the band signed a deal with emi records and "celebration" appeared in september. in 1987 the band's second album, “white noise”, followed.
in september 1987 evan murray died in a car accident while the group were on tour and the band essentially disbanded.
randall waller remaining in the industry, working as a producer, engineer, and then guitarist in shania twain’s band.
