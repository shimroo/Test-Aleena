michigan beer cans (mbc)


 



 
 




             picking up where "beer cans of michigan (bcom)" left off,
             the electronic reference "michigan beer cans (mbc)"
             provides the michigan beer can specialist a full color, high
             quality, digital reference of all known beer cans (including
             minor variations) produced by the state of michigan. with
             757 variations now documented, this is a must have
             for the serious michigan collector! five years of effort, major
             time, travel and $$$ went into producing this content, with
             mbc production version 1.11 released august, 2012, and version 2.2
             full content review, updated january 2025.

california straight steel tabs (css)





 




             with the number of undocumented michigan variations becoming few
             and far between, and myself now having lived over half my life in
             sunny california, it was only natural to branch into something
             from my new home state. continuing in the mbc format, my web site
             now shows as many california self-opening steel tabs as i have been able to
             document, now 491 variations and counting! this is still a
             work in progress but a very solid start...
