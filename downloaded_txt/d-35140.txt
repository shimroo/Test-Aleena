join the adventure



scoutingâ€™s programs and outdoor adventures give young people equal opportunities to try new things, provide service to others, build self-confidence, and develop leadership skills. these experiences not only help scouts while they are young, but help them grow into exceptional men and women that respect their family, community, religion, country, and themselves.
the scouting america, laurel highlands council serves youth members and volunteer adult leaders throughout southwestern pennsylvania and portions of the potomac region in maryland and west virginia. we aim to beneficially involve every eligible child and their family in the fun and adventure of our programs. we provide extraordinary youth development programs that develop and strengthen the values of the scout oath and law.
