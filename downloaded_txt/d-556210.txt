welcome to our chapter
whether you fly, build, restore or simply enjoy airplanes and aviation, you are welcome to attend our events and join our chapter.
our meetings are held the last thursday of each month from september straight through may. 
you do not need to own or be building your own aircraft. all that is required is an interest in all things aviation.
