one in christ 



diocesan annual appeal 

















the diocese of lexington’s annual appeal is a visible expression of our unity as the body of christ.  each donation to the fund is a sign that we believe in the gospel message to “love one another as i have loved you” [john 15:12]. it is an affirmation of our belief that “faith without works is useless” [james 2:20].  it demonstrates that we believe that whatever you do to others, you do to jesus. 



















providing for our future 



campaign for the diocese of lexington 

















the diocese of lexington struggles to provide meaningful financial support to multiple ministries due to our current debt level. we are embarking upon a debt campaign to address our needs and to provide for a future that enables us to be financially nimble and responsive to our region’s needs. please click on the image above to learn more about this important diocesan effort.
