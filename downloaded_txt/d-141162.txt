“for scientific discovery give me scott; for efficiency give me amundsen; but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, give me shackleton every time"





in the preface to his 1922 book the worst journey in the world, apsley cherry-garrard, one of scott's team on the terra nova expedition, wrote: "for a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me scott; for a winter journey, wilson; for a dash to the pole and nothing else, amundsen: and if i am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me shackleton every time".

from national geographic creative: "sir ernest shackleton and his crew took bitter defeat and turned it into heroic survival. early last century, members of the imperial trans-antarctic expedition watched as their ship, the endurance was crushed by the frozen sea. they were left with no radio and no hope of rescue. for more than a year, they drifted on packed ice, surviving on seal, penguin, and eventually dog meat, while battling freezing temperatures and mind-numbing boredom. when shackleton, along with all 28 members of the expedition, emerged at stromness whaling station in may, 1916, almost two years after their departure, the world was shocked."

video:



sir ernest henry shackleton died of hear attack at age 47 during his last expedition. robert falcon scott died at age 43 from hypothermia during his last expedition. roald engelbregt gravning amundsen died at age 55, he disappeared while on a plane taking part in a rescue mission.
