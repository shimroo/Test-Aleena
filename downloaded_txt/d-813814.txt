welcome to our new look! 
we are completing our twentieth year at csdirectory and are now working on a completely new site design and navigation which will be easier to use on your smart phone as well as tablet, laptop and desktop computer. as you enter the site you will quite likely be taken to pages still in the old design, but we are working to convert to this new design section by section as funds allow. 
scroll down and and check us out...
please consider making a tax-deductible (in the usa) donation to help this project along. thank you.
