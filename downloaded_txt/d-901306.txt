all our guests ask about our famous wild iris cookies. we would like to share our receipe so you can take a little piece of la conner home!

ingredients:
1 cup butter (melted)
1 cup brown sugar 
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs   
1 tsp vanilla
1.5 tbsp water
2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder 
1 tsp salt   
1 tsp baking soda
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1.5 cups dried coconut
1.5 cups dried cranberries
1 cup walnuts (chopped) 
1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
1.5 cups granola







method: 
in a small mixing bowl, blend the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until creamy.  add the eggs, vanilla and water. mix until well blended.

in another larger bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda, then add the white chocolate chips, chocolate chips, coconut, cranberries, walnuts, rolled oats and granola. add the wet ingredients to the dry and blend well.

shape into golf ball sized balls and place on an ungreased parchment paper lined cookie sheet. bake at 325 for 10 minutes or until just
                  turning brown. take a spatula and gently round out the cookies. after a few minutes, remove them and place them on a cooling rack.  give 
                  them another “rounding” with the spatula, which will add some height.
