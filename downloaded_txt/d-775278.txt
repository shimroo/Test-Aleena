stoning by numbers: a, b, c

mew para!
every so often champions manage to bring a good chuckle to a hunt (or at the very least, they get a little giggle from me).  i scribbled down some notes from a recent foray, to share with your audience.  thinking about submitting it to the theater so someone can punch it up into a full-blown play.  enjoy!
act i: a problem, a proposed solution
2/9/25 10:36:35p jo ma'ril says, "couldn't stone in time"
2/9/25 10:36:52p seaforth says, "lets stone in alphabetical order :-d"
2/9/25 10:37:14p seaforth says, "giben, you're up"
2/9/25 10:37:48p giben turns to stone.
act ii: complexities within the process
2/9/25 10:38:45p seaforth says, "i guess abox comes before g, now that i think of it..."
2/9/25 10:38:58p dae fenris exclaims, "the system is off to a great start!"
2/9/25 10:39:11p (abox can't spell)
2/9/25 10:39:27p (seaforth counts letters)
2/9/25 10:39:36p seaforth exclaims, "henryk, youre next!"
2/9/25 10:39:51p henryk says, "not enough spirit sorry"
2/9/25 10:40:04p seaforth yells, "jo you are next"
act iii: rules are meant to be broken
2/9/25 10:43:08p seaforth turns to stone.
2/9/25 10:44:28p seaforth says, "back to you for next stone, abox."
2/9/25 10:44:33p (seaforth skips jo)
2/9/25 10:47:10p seaforth turns to stone.
2/9/25 10:47:29p (seaforth pretends to be abox)
p.s. nothing but love to our champions!
