the institute for the study of learning and expertise (isle) is a
nonprofit organization dedicated to research and education in machine
learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. isle is
supported by grants from the national
science foundation, the defense 
advanced research projects agency, and 
nasa ames research center. these grants support research on transfer of
learned knowledge, computational aides for scientific discovery in 
biology and earth science, and learning from traces of expert behavior. 

isle has ongoing collaborations with researchers 
at stanford university, 
the center 
for computational astrobiology at nasa ames research center, 
and bbn technologies. 
isle has especially close ties with stanford's 

center for the study of language and information, 
where isle researchers also serve as members of the 
computational learning
laboratory.
