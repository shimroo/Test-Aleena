 cognitive technologies on 
            the cutting edge




a trimodal theory of decision making. researchers in many areas of decision making have concentrated on narrow slices of the decision making domain, e.g., choice in classical decision theory or recognition in naturalistic research. we attempt to distill a more accurate and comprehensive conception of decision making from recent empirical research and theory, to elucidate some of its normative and descriptive features, and to draw conclusions for the cognitive engineering of decision aids.

time and uncertainty in naturalistic decision making. this chapter focuses on a critical issue in ndm research: experts management of the time they take to gather information and verify assessments and decisions. we critique ndm theories that equate expertise entirely with substantive knowledge, trivilizing the issue of time management. satisfactory management of time for deliberation requires not only substantive domain knowledge but also the acquisition of strategic thinking skill. we cite both conceptual arguments and experimental evidence with commercial airline pilots for this hypothesis, and we present a model of a relatively automatic process for allocating time baseed on animal foraging. the foraging for surprise model predicts that thinking strategies will improve as decision makers spend varying amounts of time deliberating about tasks that vary in known uncertainty, novelty, and cost of delay. we contrast this model with a "stopping rule" proposal that imples fixed, pre-existing knowledge structures (klein, et al.'s data-frame theory). we sketch some implications for training and decision aiding from an ndm perspective.

dialogue 
                and critical thinking. critical 
                thinking is a purposive dialogue with oneself or others, 
                about alternative possibilities. critical thinking 
                usually takes place in a practical context, where its purpose 
                is to improve situation understanding or decisionmaking -- by 
                proposing, critiquing, evaluating, and improving alternative hypotheses, 
                interpretations of evidence, predicted outcomes, goals, and courses 
                of action. dialogue theory enables us to identify dialogue roles 
                and phases, and moves and constraints associated with each, that 
                characterize successful critical thinking dialogue, and which 
                enable participants to achieve their purposes within the time 
                available.

dialogue 
                and leadership. leadership skills  are displayed in the way individuals 
                communicate with one another in the context of a collaborative 
                practical activity. an integration of cognitive and communicative 
                concepts leads to a conceptualization of leadership as the 
                orchestration and improvisation of appropriate dialogues to achieve 
                group objectives. leaders must learn to recognize the 
                types of dialogue that are appropriate to different situations 
                and understand how to recognize and implement the associated expectations 
                and roles. they must also acquire skills for overcoming obstacles 
                to successful dialogue and for managing the flow of conversation 
                without violating trust.

naturalistic decision 
                making and critical thinking. we have learned from 
                studies of proficient real-world decision makers that they are 
                distinguished by (1) their recognitional skills -- the ability 
                to recognize familiar patterns and to rapidly retrieve appropriate 
                expectations, goals, and responses -- and (2) by their ability 
                to apply their experience in unfamiliar, novel, or anomalous situations, 
                which do not match previous patterns. under the latter conditions, 
                recognition needs to be supplemented by metacognitive processes 
                that monitor the products of recognition and, when problems are 
                found, adopt strategies to resolve them. cti's recognition 
                / metacognition model provides a systematic 
                and precise account of processes that decision makers use to understand 
                and plan in such novel and uncertain situations. 
                here are some basic readings about this model and its applications:

                    the model: cohen,

mental 
                models and critical thinking.
according to the recognition / metacognition model, effective 
                decision makers monitor their own evolving mental models. when 
                they find different types of uncertainty (e.g., gaps, conflicts, 
                or unreliable assumptions), they draw from a repertoire of strategies 
                for addressing that type of uncertainty. refinement, modification, 
                or replacement of mental models is therefore problem-driven, subject 
                to regulation by the stakes of the problem and the time available. 
                (cti received recognition for its mental models work by being 
                named of the five best small business innovative research projects 
                in 1999.)

                  m., thompson, b.b., adelman, l., bresnick, t.a., tolcott, m.a.,

                  mental models. arlington, va: cognitive technologies, inc..



simulating 
                critical thinking. a computer-based implementation 
                of the recognition / metacognition model has been developed . 
                this work represents a synthesis of our model with work on rapid 
                parallel inference by dr. 
                lokendra shastri of the international computer science institute, 
                affiliated with the university of california at berkeley. the 
                tool, called shruti, 
                has two levels: (1) it performs rapid recognitional inferences 
                and planning within a large expert belief network, utilizing temporal 
                synchrony to maintain dynamic object binding and support complex 
                relational reasoning.(2) it executes a metacognitive control process 
                that monitors recognitional results for different types of uncertainty 
                and shifts attention within active memory to activate new long-term 
                knowledge and adjust assumptions. a simulation of a tactical army 
                battlefield scenario, as well as a navy tactical scenario, has 
                been implemented in this system, and are suitable for use in training 
                systems and decision aids.

                  m. s., thompson, b. b., adelman, l., bresnick, t. a., shastri,

                  inc.



decision aids, 
                mental models, and critical thinking. cti has developed 
                several decision aid prototypes based on the recognition / metacognition 
                model. all these aids enable users both to (1) view and manipulate 
                graphical representations of mental models, and (2) annotate or 
                revise the models to highlight problems and solutions discovered 
                in critical thinking. in addition, some of the systems also support 
                 collaborative critiquing and improving of mental 
                models, as well as real-time retrieval of information that is 
                relevant to improving or correcting the model under construction..              

a decision aid for time-stressed decision making 
                  based on cognitive theory: cohen 
                  m.s., freeman, j.t., & thompson, b.t. (1997). integrated critical 
                  thinking training and decision support for tactical anti-air 
                  warfare. in 3d international command and control research 
                  and technology symposium proceedings.



cti has studied the way users interact with advanced decision 
                aiding systems and has developed methods for adapting decision 
                aid displays and reasoning strategies to human cognitive strengths 
                and weaknesses. 



a cognitive framework for the design of adaptive decision 
                  aids, applied to automated target recognition: cohen, 
                  m., & tolcott, m.a. (1992). a cognitive basis for automated 
                  target recognition interface design. arlington, va: cognitive 
                  technologies, inc. experiments on atr design conducted within 
                  the framework: cohen, 
                  m., thompson, b.b., freeman, j. t. (1997). cognitive aspects 
                  of automated target recognition interface design: an experimental 
                  analysis. arlington, va: cognitive technologies, inc..



cti developed a decision analytic theory of trust in 
                decision aids that conceptualizes it as a situation-specific
expectation of system performance, over different 
                time periods and conditional on different phases and circumstances 
                of use. the model makes predictions about the dynamic evolution 
                of trust  and the appropriateness of different user interaction 
                strategies (e.g., when monitoring is or is not appropriate). we 
                have developed training for critical thinking 
                by decision aid users based on the model.
