the alagnak lodge is where the pristine alagnak river cold water watershed flows into bristol bay.  


















where the fish come to you.
here on the tidal waters of the alagnak river, we've built a truely unique alaskan fishing lodge.  enjoy the luxury of experiencing a true wilderness experience while having our staff do all the work for you, leaving you free to enjoy the experience.  
all salmon returning to their alagnak river home waters for spawning pass by our lodge.  usually the best fishing is close to the lodge, so you can spend more time with your line in the water rather than traveling to the fish.










































pristine wilderness watershed!
greet the salmon as they transition from the saltwater of bristol bay to the freshwater of the alagnak river.  our entire watershed remains an undeveloped wilderness.  it has not yet been degraded by global warming or damaged by catastrophic events as have so many cold-water watersheds.  it has remained highly resilient as have our fish populations and wildlife.  


















it is all about you!
our entire lodge program, from the time you make your reservations to your departure from the lodge, is designed to meet the needs and desires of our clients.  we offer a lot of flexibility to ensure you are receiving and enjoying exactly what you want.  we try to anticipate your desires,  and we listen to you and respond to your suggestions. this is your trip and we want to maximize your enjoyment.

location
here is where the fish ride in on the tides to spawn upstream. they all pass by our lodge. spend your time with your line in the water rather than traveling to the fish.








a true wilderness
the entire alagnak river watershed is protected as an unspoiled wilderness.  it has never been degredated and is truely pristine for its entire length.










wild fish
our salmon are genetically pure. there are no farmed or hatchery fish in the watershed.  only the best make it back to their native river to spawn.








wildlife

limited access
the alagnak river is realistically accessible only by float plane. there are relatively few fishermen.  this feels like the wilderness it is.  fish our evening session and feel alone on  the river.

flexible schedule
we offer a flexible daily schedule, including evening fishing.  schedule your fishing and relaxation times as you desire. meals are scheduled for an hour and fishing sessions are 4.5 hours each.  
 








guides
our guides work as a team to share information and satisfy all clients. they are consistently highly rated by our clients.  with only two clients per guide, you get personalized attention and all the support you desire.
