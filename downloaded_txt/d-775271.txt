the foundation of our work

policies
the praesidium safety equation® is a framework of eight organizational operations that allows your organization to identify where abuse could occur. using current research and root cause analyses of thousands of cases of abuse across a diverse range of organizations, we have identified best practices in each operation and developed solutions to help you implement these best practices. 


screening and selection
comprehensive screening and selection requires organizations to discover and consider everything they can about applicants and to use what is known about how offenders operate to make thoughtful hiring decisions. while background checks are necessary, very few offenders have criminal records. therefore, other aspects of the screening and selection process must be considered to avoid giving someone who should not be in a position of trust access to those you serve.


training
effective abuse prevention training gives employees and volunteers the information and skills they need to keep those in their care safe. training must be frequent, specific, and immediately useful on the job. it must teach stakeholders how offenders operate, how to recognize inappropriate/suspicious interactions, and how to respond effectively.


monitoring and supervision
effective monitoring and supervision practices are essential for managing abuse risk. organizations must have procedures in place to supervise employees and volunteers, supervise youth, monitor high-risk activities, and monitor architectural or facility risks.
 


internal feedback systems
information about program operations, such as incident reports, client complaints, or external licensing violations, can identify high-risk programs or individuals. this internal feedback allows an organization to identify risk and use information to make informed program and safety improvements and minimize barriers to reporting.


consumer participation
if consumers — vulnerable adults and youth alike — know how to recognize suspicious or inappropriate interactions or policy violations, they can be a valuable part of the risk management team. organizations should educate and empower both clients and community members on how to share their concerns and provide feedback to the organization.


responding
how an organization responds to reports of suspicious or inappropriate interactions, policy violations, or suspected abuse can dramatically affect the harm to the individual and to the organization. swift and determined action is required as soon as a concern or allegation is presented.
 


administrative practices
in most organizations, a governing body is ultimately responsible for approving policies and safety protocols. therefore, the governing body or board of directors must be well informed of the risks the organization embraces and the operational practices in place to ensure the safety of those in care. organizational leadership must ensure that drift from standards of safety and care is quickly identified and remedied.
