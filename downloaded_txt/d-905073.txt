        hodgkin’s lymphoma & breast cancer survivor    


in 2002, cory was diagnosed with hodgkin’s lymphoma blood cancer. her unwavering spirit and extraordinary strength at such a young age would unknowingly be vital to her decades later, and translate into motivation, hope and positivity for future generations.
