   don mckinney's family
history home page



i have dedicated this web site to my parents, donald & eda faye (thomasson) mckinney, who are buried at the fort riley military cemetery, kansas.  the main emphasis of this site will be to honor them and their ancestors, maintaining their legacies with stories & narratives, thus keeping their memories alive in our hearts.  i am especially grateful to all my relatives, close & distant, who have, through the years, contributed to my knowledge of our family heritage.
our parents met & married while both were stationed with the military at fort riley,
kansas during world war ii.  dad was a cowboy from wyoming who had joined the u.s.
horse cavalry & mother was a small town arkansas girl who joined the waacs. 


i have been interested in genealogy & the research of my own personal family history for many years. i also enjoy locating & visiting ancestral home sites & cemeteries throughout various areas of our country.

  sometimes, i feel compelled to write and/or publish articles concerning our ancestors who endured the hardships and turmoil of many years ago. i don't pretend to be a creative writer who garnishes his material with flowery fiction. i am not a poet, philosopher or an intellectual who creates inspirational material promoting spiritual growth to help find one's "inner self".  i will leave that to the many talented individuals who are so gifted.  i am also not a spinner of mythical "tall tales" or mystical fantasy land "fairy tales"--i merely chronicle the lives of my ancestors based on legitimate facts & traditions relating to them.  

  i think everyone should try to "get to know" their ancestors.  even though they have long since passed away,  they can still be very inspirational. most of our ancestors were good, decent people but perhaps far from perfect. hopefully we can learn from them & try to appreciate their sacrifices & struggles which can help us all gain a better understanding of our own virtues & shortcomings as we do our part to help improve society for the future.  not caring about our heritage is like not caring about ourselves.

wyoming & arkansas ancestors.














 below are some
of our ancestral families:

 pedigree chart for our father:  donald earl mckinney sr

 pedigree chart for our mother: eda faye thomasson




********************************************************************************
 most of our ancestors came to america before the revolutionary war from the  british isles:
england, 

wales, 

ireland, 

scotland

 (click on links above for a brief generalized overview of ancient ancestral roots.   after the withdrawal of the roman empire   during the 5th century a.d., the british isles gradually, through the next few centuries, became another "melting pot" of various celtic, teutonic, scandanavian & norman warrior tribes who invaded/settled the area during those medieval times.)

********************************************************************************

 our father,
 

donald earl mckinney sr, was born & raised in  
 lander, fremont county, wyoming, the son of  
earl & amelia grace "dottie" (farthing) mckinney, area cattle ranchers.


donald sr's ancestral familes include:

mckinney: donald mckinney sr's paternal grandfather, 


edward coffin mckinney, settled in  
fremont county, wyoming abt 1885 from kaneohe, oahu, hawaii, where he was born. sometime, during the 1890's, after his marriage to 



lenora sarah "nora" gaylor, he changed the family name from mckenney to mckinney, probably to be consistent with the spelling used by local record keepers after his arrival in wyoming. (see gaylor family below)
ed & wife nora operated various horse & cattle ranches in fremont county, wyoming.  ed's brother & descendants, who settled in neighboring utah, retained the mckenney spelling. 
edward mckinney's father, 

andrew jackson mckenney, sr, was born in stetson, maine, however, shortly before the civil war, while still a teenager, boarded a ship which sailed to the opposite ocean, ending up in oahu, hawaii.  while on oahu, andrew married widow  louisa grace (richards) rowan, originally of cornwall, england. 
 2001 trip to kaneohe, oahu, hawaii



previous generations of
our 
mckinney/mckenney family were settlers of scarborough, cumberland county, maine. 

our earliest known ancestor was 
 john mackenny, an immigrant from scotland who was transported to boston, massachusetts in 1652 after he & other scots were captured by oliver cromwell's english forces during the civil wars of that era. after serving his 7 year indenture in the boston & surrounding area, he moved to scarborough, maine which was then a province of massachusetts colony.  

there is some speculation from several researchers & descendants that our ancestor, john mackenny of scarborough, maine was associated with or his surname evolved from certain clans of scotland.  mackenzie, mackinnon (of skye), mackean/macian (of clan donald/macdonald) etc.  i no longer lean toward mackenzie (pronounced with silent z during 1600's).  i have seen no conclusive evidence to support any theories of his association with a particular clan or any specific area in scotland where he resided.  any "legitimate" information will be greatly appreciated.

george & catharine (hutton) thomason, of london, england, who were close friends of poet john milton.  the father george was a book publisher in london, well known in literary circles as the collector of the civil war tracts.  george is also believed to have been born about 1602 in sudlow, cheshire, england & was the son of george thomason sr, a farmer from that area of northwest england. the cheshire area of england is just northeast of wales, not far from southern scotland.


there is some speculation from some researchers & descendants that the ancient ancestors of our thomason family of cheshire, england (later london) originated in  scotland & were associated with clan macfarlane.  some thomason's originated from scotland & were associated with that clan, however,  i have seen no real evidence to support the theory that the thomason families of 16th century cheshire were connected to those scottish groups.  any "legitimate" information will be greatly appreciated.
