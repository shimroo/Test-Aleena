was 
              at dexter today with brian, and i caught this pike minnow with a 
              large wound on its belly. i'm thinking it's a lamprey bite since 
              it's perfectly circular. also, the belly area seems like an obvious 
              spot as a lamprey makes the attack from underneath as it swims up 
              towards the fish. i never thought as lamprey being in dexter, which 
              makes me wonder about all those recreational swimmers.

thank you to everyone for the kind words. 
              i am doing much better, not back to 100% but better. i began getting 
              out a few days ago. will have some videos soon. for now, i'm still 
              uploading videos from summer. i'm a little behind with videos but 
              hope to catch up soon. 
well, summer is over and that's a bummer 
              because calm seas are over with. which means, no more depoe bay 
              rock fishing in my kayak. of course, there are chances that the 
              swell will lay down in the winter, it's just a lot more rare. 
i posted the 5th 
              championship for next summer here. be sure to check it out. 
              now, when the time comes and you registered and pay your fee, i 
              will put your name on the roster, so be sure to check this roster 
              after you paid for the tournament. roster page will be posted when 
              the payment page goes online in april 2024.
i'm also thinking of doing a end-of-year 
              biggest surf perch contest, where contestants can submit photos 
              of their biggest surf perch. so stay tuned for that. 

 
clamming trip over the summer. clam chowder was the best!

i'm still going to be out for a little while. 
              this is tough, but i'm going to pull through it. in the meantime, 
              i will continue to upload some videos i took over the summer. i 
              have about 8 videos from the summer that i plan to upload. so stay 
              tuned for those.
