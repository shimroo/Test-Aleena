robert christgau's big-hearted theory of pop







book reports features reviews of not only the pop-music
tomes you'd predict but also literary fiction, marxist-adjacent
cultural commentary, feminist debates over pornography, and even books
about the past decade's financial crisis. it follows a collection that
christgau published last year, is it still good to ya? fifty years
of rock criticism, 1967-2017, which includes christgau's takes on,
among many other things, classic rock, kanye west, the music of desert
storm, lollapalooza, ladysmith black mambazo, and so-called guilty
pleasures--a category that christgau rejects, since, for rock critics,
as he puts it, "pleasure is where meaning begins." together, these
collections make the sneaky case that christgau is not just the dean
of american rock critics, his self-awarded and perhaps slightly
off-putting nickname, but one of america's
sharper public intellectuals of the past half century, and certainly
one of its most influential--not to mention one of the better stylists
in that cohort. fun is a big part of why.
--david cantwell, the new yorker
