											how can i make sure all my students are grasping my lessons in class.
									 	

diversifying lesson plans- fair, not equal
one of the increasingly popular mantras in education is "fair is not equal. fair is getting what you need". we in education are starting to realize that each class does not have all learners of one nature. you have students who are struggling, either with the topic or with english language, your middle of the road students, and your high achievers.  most teachers only teach to the middle, because it seems easiest and most likely to serve the entire class. however, when you only teach to the middle of the spectrum, you are actually alienating two out of the three groups in your classroom. your struggling students are not working on the middle level, and thus will get lost and exasperated or depressed. at the same time, high achievers are getting bored and feeling anxious to move on.  you can't just teach the struggling students- it bores both the middle and upper level students. you can't just teach the high achievers- then almost no one knows what is going on. so what do you do?  tiering your lessons is a fantastic way to get all the students in your class on task. it's also incredibly simple.  first, create your middle lesson plan as usual. this is the work your average students will get during class. next, create a challenge lesson- an extension of the lesson that is a little harder and more involved. the higher achievers, who will finish the average lesson, can move on to this. finally, create a way to scaffold the average lesson so you can assist the struggling students in the initial task in a group.

											how can i teach students who are not necessarily "book smart"?
									 	

gardner's multiple intelligences- not all kids learn equally
all students are not the same. we assume "smart" means a very specific type of learner when, in fact, the opposite is true. educational psychologists back the concept put forth by howard gardner in the early 1980s that students have various modalities and intelligences that define how they learn and understand the world. teachers looking to reach some of the more academically challenged students, as well as parents of struggling children, would do well to consider applying alternative intelligence activities to their daily curriculum. here are the 9 types of intelligences gardner defines.  logical-mathematical- these are your typical book smart learners. they do well with abstractions, logic, reasoning, numbers, and critical thinking. these students are considered to have fluid intelligence that can apply in several areas, and do well with problem solving and pattern recognition activities.  spatial- these kids can visualized things within space and time. architects and artists, they have a keen mind's eye and can apply it to puzzles and other visual activities.  linguistic- these are your talkers, readers, and writers. they revel in language and can enjoy word play and more challenging texts in the classroom.  bodily-kinesthetic- these are the hands-on learners, who understand the world most clearly in terms of physical space. they require high energy, high impact activities to stay focused and understand tasks.  musical- the sound group. musical students have some ability in pattern recognition and math, but more in simple auditory actions. they enjoy the sound of words and can create rhythms easily.  interpersonal- the social butterflies. these students have a high understanding and empathy for how other people feel and connect to each other. they are people persons and can deal well in a group or one on one.  intrapersonal- these students have a keen awareness of self. self reflective and contemplative, these students are the deep thinkers who need activities to be related to their life.  naturalistic- these students love nature and can relate all things to the environment around them.  existential- highly spiritual, these students are concerned with the supernatural, religious, and beyond.

											how do i acquire early screening for speech and language for my 4 year old.
									 	

early childhood screenings: what you should know
getting speech and language screenings for your preschool age child has become much easier over the past ten years. 
if you have a head start preschool facility in your area, it's highly recommended that you enroll your child if possible. not only will your child benefit from screenings for speech and language, but they will also receive hearing, vision and dental screenings at no cost to you. 
if this facility is not in your area, you can contact your local health department for information and referrals for speech and language screenings. they can assist you in finding the right professional to suit your needs and help with getting appointments for your child.

											how can i teach my children at home?
									 	

pattern building
patterning and pattern-building is on of the most useful and most fun concepts to learn.patterns are used in math as well as reading and invite children to explore symmetry and multiplcation.
*using yarn and pasta, string necklaces in a pattern (two penne, one wagon wheel, two penne...)
*using colored "o" shaped cereal, make a necklace using color patterns, alternating colors. you can then eat the necklace!
*place paper over an object with a raised pattern and rub a crayon over it to see the pattern on paper.

											how do i teach my child simple math concepts?
									 	

sorting & classifying
teaching children how to sort and classify things encourages them to think analytically and geometrically.
play these classifying games:*give your child a "group title" (ie: foods, vehicles, or things to read") and have her come up with items that fall into that category ("things to read" might include books, magazines, newspapers)
*give your child a list of items and have her tell you what they all have in common (ie:apple, banana, cherry are all "fruits")
*randomly collect a bunch of small objects (marbles, buttons, sponges, feathers, paperclips). work with your child to sort them as many ways as you can (you can sort by shape, color, size, weight, useful vs non-useful items, household vs outdoor items)use your imagination.

comparisons
bigger, smaller, heavier, lighter, longer, shorter: these are all comparisons. we use them to describe objects and they help children develop measurement skills.
try these comparison games/activities:
*make parachutes using a square handkerchiefs and paper cups. place different items in the cups and drop from a high place (ie: top of staircase). have your child predict which parachute will land first.
*put different objects into a paper bag (an apple, stuffed animal, keys, toy car, etc). have your child close his eyes and choose two items from the bag. compare the items, which is softer, heavier, smaller?
