welcome to
eagle creek golf course








eagle creek golf course is a beautiful public 18 hole golf course, owned by the city of lagrange and managed on-site by guy breeds. only 22 miles from downtown louisville, we are conveniently located just 1.5 miles south of i-71 on highway 53.
eagle creek is open to the public 7 days a week and can provide a challenge to golfers of all skill levels. the course is well maintained and features bermuda fairways, bent grass greens, and has woods surrounding a number of holes. the serene setting makes it a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of life to get out and enjoy a good time with family or friends.
for those looking for a little bit of friendly competition, eagle creek offers both a 9-hole ladies league and a 9-hole men’s league over the summer months.
come out and play golf at eagle creek golf course and see why our course is the #1 municipal golf course in kentucky – golf digest, august 2009.
