				however, if you have a disability we are here to help you. please call our disability services phone line at (508) 548-8179 during regular business hours and one of our kind and friendly personal shoppers will help you navigate through our website, help conduct advanced searches, help you choose the item you are looking for with the specifications you are seeking, read you the specifications of any item and consult with you about the products themselves. there is no charge for the help of this personal shopper for anyone with a disability. finally, your personal shopper will explain our privacy policy and terms of service, and help you place an order if you so desire.
