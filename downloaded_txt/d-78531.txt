seaside is for fun
 
some places are just for relaxation. you can do that perfectly well in seaside but we also promise you'll have tons of fun. we are the kite flying, sand castle making, boogie boarding, ancient forest hiking, grand promenade strolling, skee-balling, kayaking, tandem biking, swan boating, sunset picnicking and bumper car-bumping capital of the oregon coast! which is to say, seaside is for remembering what an amazing vacation feels like.
