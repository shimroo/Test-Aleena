samos. an island with unique natural beauties. it is situated in east aegean

              sea, right across the shores of minor asia. an  channel of 1200m

              (7 stadia in the ancient greek measure of length) separates the

              two of them. north of samos is the peninsula of erythrea, northwest

              of

              it "myrovolos" chios, while west and southwest of the island we meet ikaria and the island

              complex of fourni. south of samos are located dodecanese islands,

              agathonisi, arki and patmos are the closest to it.


              it is an island with green mountains, endless vineyards, which

              produce the famous samiotiko wine, and lacy shores. samos is a

              relatively big island. it is a hilly island of 475 sq. km extend.

              it has two mountains, the wild and rocky kerki of 1443m height

              and the verdant ambelos or karvouni of 1160m height. 


              samo's ground is rather fertile and in combination to the temperate

              climate - cool summer and warm winter - creates the ideal conditions

              for the cultivation of olive

              groves. it is not accidental that

              samos' wine is renowned from ancient times for its fine taste.

              even today, wine remains the main product of samos. sun is shining

              all over the island for more than a semester, during summer season,

              when clouds are rare in the sky.

              


              samos is an island with age-long history. according

              to mythology, in this aegean island, in the banks of river imvrassos,

              goddess hera was born. today, in this location visitors can see

              the remains of a temple dedicated to her. it is an imposing building,

              one of the biggest and most important of its era. 


              one of the most famous philosophers and mathematicians

              of ancient times, pythagoras, lived in samos. the astronomer aristarchos

              and

            philosopher epikouros also came from this aegean island.        

              


              during ancient times, samos was an important cultural

               center. as

                it seems from the findings, in the island flourished an important

                civilization during the tyranny of polykrates, around 550 bc.

                it was the time when samos was the first naval aegean force and

                the center of ionic civilization. it was then that the famous

                temple

                of hera and efpalinio orygma, the ancient aqueduct, were

            built. 


              samos' tourist infrastructures satisfy all demands. wonderful beaches.

              modern hotel units, luxurious rooms- to-let complexes in vathi,

              karlovasi,

                kokkari, pythagorio, as and all around the island, create the

                best conditions in order to have an unforgettable holiday. as

                for entertainment, options vary and, in combination to the culture

                of the island, leave visitors with a sweet taste.

              system improves transportation and exploratory attitude...		    

























 

 heraion
  
  the temple was built near the mouth of the river imvrasos because the area was connected with the worship of the goddess even though the ground isn't so stable.
