“i picked up a few bars of your ocean mist soap while on vacation some time ago, and i love it. i especially like the fact that it seems to be very gentle on my skin and doesn’t seem to dry it out, even on those rare occasions when i use it on my face. ”

“ i first discovered your soap at whole foods when i lived in austin tx many years ago. i have bought no soap other than yours since then. i love the aroma and the fact that it treats my body well. you should be proud of offering such great soap.”

“ okay, i don’t normally leave reviews but i just bought the sweet citrus bar, and let me tell you... i felt like i had become the world’s most luxurious cup of tea. the smell is absolutely amazing and actually lingers for a bit after using it, and not at all in a bad way. i want everything in my house to smell like this. i would sleep next to this bar of soap if i wasn’t certain i would get it in my eyes. i walk into the bathroom just to sniff it. and omg it doesn’t stop there... it exfoliates! and not in an irritating way either. also, the ingredients are so wholesome. woot.”
