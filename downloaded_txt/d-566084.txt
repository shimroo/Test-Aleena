'this christmas' gets an 'american idol'-style promo campaign





christmas came early to the baldwin hills crenshaw plaza this year.on a sunny, 75-degree day in october, dozens of aspiring stars from across the southland gathered there to raise their voices in song, competing in an "american idol"-inspired contest.each was asked to perform 60 seconds from either "silent night" or the donny hathaway r&b favorite "this christmas" before a panel of "celebrity judges."even if the songs were at odds with the spirit of a season defined by jack-o'-lanterns and artificial cobwebs, they were sung in the service of a yuletide hallmark that arrives each year as faithfully as old saint nick: a christmas movie.the competition was actually part of a multi-platform promotional campaign for the upbeat family comedy "this christmas," which hits theaters nov. 21 and stars teenage r&b superstar chris brown, regina king and delroy lindo. similar competitions took place in 34 other cities across the country, and it was 18-year-old atlanta native antenica n. smith who took home the top prize. smith was chosen via online poll at aol's black voices portal -- where clips of the contestants' performances can be viewed -- and will sing live tonight on black entertainment television's "106 & park," a special also intended to hype "this christmas." the newcomer will share the stage with none other than pop prince brown.winning was only of secondary concern to tiara edwards, 19, who heard about the contest on the radio early last month and, on a whim, drove from lancaster in an eye-popping minidress to perform her song standing in front of a "this christmas" one sheet."i want to take chris brown out on a date!" edwards said. "i'll even pay."if i don't win, i'll probably see the movie anyways."screen gems has become moviedom's foremost practitioner of the contest-promo gambit.sony's scrappy genre division successfully staged fan competitions in conjunction with its previous urban youth-oriented films, the teen dance drama "you got served," which topped the box office in its 2004 weekend debut and the collegiate dance drama "stomp the yard," which took the no. 1 spot in its opening weekend in january.marc weinstock, screen gems' executive vice president of marketing, explained the way such contests virally generate publicity without costing big advertising bucks."when winners are selected, those markets see grassroots efforts geared to help a local represent [his or her] city," weinstock said. "those winners get on local radio, print and tv. and that translates into people seeing the movie. it's branding six weeks before the open."weinstock added that christmas movies have historically benefited from strong word of mouth -- the cornerstone of the marketing push for '"this christmas.""there are so many things we love about contests," he said. "they bring the movies to fans in a way that's not advertising. it gets them excited about the talent. and music is a big part of the backdrop in this movie -- chris brown's character sings two amazing songs -- so it was concept-related. most contests are like, 'hey, win a trip to washington d.c.' ""this christmas" cast member lauren london, who plays a conflicted college student home for the holidays in the film, was roped into judging the singing challenge at the baldwin hills crenshaw plaza. she was most struck by contestants' palpable mix of eagerness and apprehension -- their fervent desire to get into brown's mix."it seems like it's a big thing for them," london said. "i saw people whose hands were shaking. they didn't know where to look. chris brown is so hot right now, he has that effect on people."

american idol controversy





main article: american idol controversyfans and critics alike were stunned at melinda doolittle's departure. simon cowell admitted that the sixth season's crown should have rightfully gone to melinda.executive producer nigel lythgoe responded, noting that "[idol producers] were so engrossed with the mentors and didn't really focus on the melinda doolittles of the show". lythgoe also produces so you think you can dance, and has noted that the dance program gives background information about its contestants, while american idol will focus more on its big name celebrity mentors, such as tony bennett, gwen stefani, and jennifer lopez.american idol has come under fire for maintaining what some claim to be total control of the careers of the winners of the contest. former co-host brian dunkleman referred to the show as "owning" the winning contestants, noting that winners sign contracts to only record with companies owned by the show's producers and to allow related agencies to manage their careers. former contestant corey clark told reporters in april 2005 that he and idol judge paula abdul had a "secret affair" prompting an investigation by external counsel hired by fox, fremantlemedia and 19 entertainment. the 600-hour investigation spanning three months cleared abdul of all charges levied by clark. during season three, controversy arose at the poor showing during the semi-finals of three highly praised african american contestants, jennifer hudson, latoya london and fantasia barrino - collectively known during that season as the 'three divas'. after the surprise elimination of hudson, sir elton john, who was a guest judge for that season criticized the vote as 'incredibly racist' in a press conference.the elimination of both hudson and london relatively early in the competition has been pointed out as a classic demonstration of vote splitting in the american idol vote.barrino would eventually go on to win the competition. since the 2004 season, american idol producers have battled online community services such as the websites dialidol.com, worldsentiment.com, and votefortheworst.com. dialidol predicts which contestants may be voted off or are in danger of being voted off based on the percentage of times an automatic dialer encounters a busy signal for each contestant; worldsentiment uses very large samplings and algorithms to predict the outcome of the vote-off; and votefortheworst exhorts viewers to vote for what the site deems to be the worst contestant, rather than the best. some in the media have implied that las vegas odds makers exert behind-the-scenes influence in protecting the services.a series of provocative photos surfaced on the internet of season 6 top 24 contestant antonella barba.according to the howard 100 news lakisha jones's departure (season 6) was not because of america's vote, but rather a predetermined outcome. their source claims that travel arrangements for lakisha to return home were made prior to the start of the may 8, 2007 performance show, well before the phone lines were opened. the source also claims that a significant sized crew was sent to flint, michigan for reaction shots, however crews were not sent to the remaining contestants' home towns.

19 entertainment, american idol's parent company, agreed to pay the state of new york a $5,000 fine for breaking the state's child labor laws earlier





19 entertainment, american idol's parent company, agreed to pay the state of new york a $5,000 fine for breaking the state's child labor laws earlier this summer.  american idol singers jordin sparks and sanjaya malakar, both of whom are under 21, were cited.  neither malakar or sparks had acquired the proper work permits.  the american idol tour held four dates in the state of new york in august and september.  19 entertainment was held totally responsible, and there should be further trouble for the singers or 19 entertainment.

kid rock proclaims "american idol sucks"





in a recent interview with blender magazine, kid rock recently proclaimed that "american idol sucks."  hardly an original sentiment, at least kid rock's argument regarding idol's deficiencies is well-thought out and articulate.  oh wait, it's not.  that wasn't mr. rock's full quote.  he continued, explaining: "i think they should allow songwriters in. someone singing a song they wrote – there's nothing more powerful. but whatever, they're doing fine; they don't need me, and i don't need them."  i'm pretty sure that quote makes very little sense, but perhaps rock just lives and thinks on a higher plane of existence than the rest of us.

dolly parton too nice to be judge on 'american idol'





legendary country singer and flotation device dolly parton recently declined an invitation to act as guest judge on fox's american idol.  the reason?  she's too nice.  american idol will apparently be producing an episode next season that will pay tribute to the music of dolly parton.  she was asked by fox to help judge the singers on this episode, but parton politely declined.  dolly said, "i won't be a judge. i couldn't do that. i can't tell people they aren't doing a good job even if they ask me.  to tell someone if they're good or bad, or if they suck isn't me."

emmys 2007: how did american idol's ryan seacrest handle the hosting duties?





there was a fair amount of skepticism regarding fox's choice to hand over the emmy hosting reigns to american idol host and friend of the teeny-bopper ryan seacrest this year.  there was no controversy, per se, because it's really not that big of a deal.  it's not like seacrest's emmy appointment was out of nowhere, either.  fox has been known to shamelessly flog its own assets and as the best host on the fox network, it was wholly reasonable that he host a major award show.  the only problem was that the trend for major awards shows has been to hand over hosting duties to comedians.  ryan seacrest is no comedian.

american idol: jennifer hudson signs on for 'sex and the city' movie





jennifer hudson, former american idol contestant and academy award winner for her work in dreamgirls, has signed for a supporting role in the upcoming sex and the city film.  the long in the making movie, which was reliant on all four ladies (sarah jessica parker, kim catrall, cynthia nixon and kristin davis) agreeing to go through with the project. hudson will play sarah jessica parker's assistant in the film.there's no word yet on just how big the part of the assistant is, but for jennifer hudson to choose it as one of her first post-oscar roles, you'd have to assume it's a somewhat significant role.  the problem is, it doesn't sound like one.  is she going to play the “sassy assistant” or is she going to play the “shy assistant”?  are there any others?  i'm a jennifer hudson fan, and thought she was remarkably good in dreamgirls, so i hope it's a solid part.
