the love foundation                



the love foundation inc. is a nonprofit organization with the mission  of inspiring people to love unconditionally. our vision is to assist people by building  a practical foundation and understanding of unconditional love within individuals  and society as a whole. established in 2000, we have become an international leading resource for sharing the awareness of unconditional  love.
as truth can be found in all aspects of life, the love foundation  is designed to be an open organization built on the universal recognition of unconditional love.  as such, we are not affiliated with any religious creed or perspective. our focus  is on the personal appreciation and  pragmatic experience of unconditional  love. through education, research, and charity, we strive to share in this timeless understanding and expand our individual and collective consciousness.
