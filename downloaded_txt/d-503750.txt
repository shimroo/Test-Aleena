the y: we're for youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility.
the y is a cause-driven organization that is for youth development, for healthy living and for social responsibility. that's because a strong community can only be achieved when we invest in our kids, our health and our neighbors. we focus our work in three key areas, because nurturing the potential of kids, helping people live healthier, and supporting our neighbors are fundamental to strengthening communities.
