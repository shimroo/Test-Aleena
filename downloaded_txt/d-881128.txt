a vision and a legacy


phil hardin was an innovative and visionary businessman whose success never caused him to lose sight of his own humble beginnings. mr. hardin valued education as the most important ingredient for success in his life and knew that better educational opportunities for all would not only benefit individuals but would also make mississippi's communities stronger and more prosperous. acting on this belief, he decided in 1964 to use the wealth he had created as the owner of the meridian-based hardin's bakeries to "improve the education of mississippians," and the phil hardin foundation was born. more than half a century later, mr. hardin's vision of an excellent education as the norm for all mississippians continues to find expression in the work of the foundation he established.
