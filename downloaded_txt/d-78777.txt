welcome to edison's homepage







"he led no armies into battle, he conquered no countries and he enslaved no peoples. nonetheless, he exerted a degree of power, the magnitude of which, no warrior ever dreamed. his name still commands a respect as sweeping in scope and as world-wide as that of any other mortal. a devotion rooted deep in human gratitude and untainted by the bias that is often associated with race, color, politics, and religion."




  
"be courageous! whatever setbacks america has encountered, it has always emerged as a stronger and more prosperous nation...."
"be brave as your fathers before you. have faith and go forward"  thomas alva edison"       all website content registered and copyrighted © 2/11/97 by gerald beals
