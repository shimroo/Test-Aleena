            why did we start los cuernos?
          









as former sommeliers and industry veterans with a passion for wine, we've recognized that the wine industry has become overly elitist and complicated. our goal is to simplify it and make it accessible to everyone by breaking down barriers and providing great wines at fair prices. our vision is for wine to be enjoyed without judgment, anytime, and anywhere by anyone.ezekiel & cory, los cuernos wine co-founders








            what does the name “los cuernos” mean?
          









los cuernos (lohs kwehr-nohs), which translates to 'the horns' in spanish, pays homage to the cow, particularly carne asada, and evokes the concept of the farm as a place where exceptional wine and food are grown and cultivated.








            what do you mean by “no rules"?
          









"no rules" debunks the idea that there are specific ways to drink wine. we don't mean it literally - it's more of a tongue-in-cheek statement. the wine industry can be complex and daunting, and there are many informal rules that can make it seem like there's only one way to drink wine "correctly". however, we have different opinions on some of these so-called rules. for instance, you don't need a sommelier to explain wine - if you like it, that's all that matters. vintages, appellations, and the need for specialized glassware or corkscrews are all unnecessary constraints and friction that detract from just enjoying the wine. additionally, the idea that certain wines must be paired with specific foods and that you need to learn "wine vocabulary" to enjoy wine is basically  fluff. ultimately, our message is simple: if you like a wine, drink it - don’t overthink it, no rules required.








            what’s up with the knife and cutting board logo?
          









growing up in texas and california, our love for mexican cuisine and getting together with family and friends runs deep. the knife and cutting board in our logo represent the care, love, and skill that go into preparing a meal. whether it's a professional chef, a parent, a friend, or someone's grandma, the act of cooking is an expression of love and a way to bring people together.we believe that enjoying a good wine is not just about the drink itself, but also about the experiences and memories it helps create. so, the knife and cutting board in our logo remind us of the pleasure of sharing a delicious meal with loved ones, and we hope it does the same for our customers.








            why choose canned wine?
          









portability: canned wine is more portable than traditional bottled wine. the cans are lightweight and easy to carry, making them perfect for outdoor activities, picnics, and events where glass isn’t allowed.convenience: canned wine offers a convenient option for those who want to enjoy a single serving of wine without opening a full bottle. it's also easier to store and dispose of than a glass bottle.lights out: light is one of the biggest enemies to the shelf life of wine. by keeping the light out, cans preserve carbonation and flavor longer. sustainability: cans are more environmentally friendly than glass bottles. they are recyclable and require less energy to produce and transport. additionally, cans are more efficient in terms of storage and shipping, which minimizes the los cuernos carbon footprint.freshness: canned wine stays fresh longer than bottled wine. the airtight seal of the can prevents oxygen from entering, which can cause the wine to spoil or lose flavor.
