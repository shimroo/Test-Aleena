i just wanted to say, my husband and i truly love stewarts hotdogs!! we stopped in the kenova store after coming to town to visit family in the area. not only was the service very efficient, friendly, accurate order, and delicious; but haley, the car hop, was very sweet, quick, accommodating, etc. i do not know her last name, but she was working on saturday, january 2nd, 2021, around 3:45 pm - 4:00. great young girl with a great personality too. a people person, if you will.i just wanted to send a positive email to you, not only because you deserve it, but because i get tired of seeing people complain, but rarely leave compliments. this is a huge compliment, to your restaurant and haley! thank you for another great experience at stewarts.a fan of the best hotdogs ever,jill, from louisa, ky.






















this place is a tradition in my family. my dad is from huntington and every time we came to visit my grammy and grandpa from toledo, ohio we always made it a point to go there. it’s definitely still a staple with my family. when i ordered 2 dozen shipped for my dad who can no longer travel, the owner was attentive to detail, realized i paid too much and corrected it all while keeping in contact with me. amazing customer service, amazing dogs and they traveled perfectly in the summer heat. it was well worth a price in gold to see my dad’s face light up when i handed him the gift of yummy! - shannon biggs






















best hotdogs in the area, great staff..- mark legg






















i grew up in the tri-state and my daughters did as well. during this covid19 pandemic, we all have felt the sadness and anxiety that has come with it. stewart's packaged and mailed 2 dozen hot dogs, overnight", to their "transplanted" loyal customers in northern kentucky. this, by far, has been the most uplifting and precious thing to make our 4 household family see light at the end of the tunnel. we cannot thank you all enough!- suzanne freeman singer
