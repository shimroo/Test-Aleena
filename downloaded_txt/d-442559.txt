greg brelinsky, owner of rosalini’s pizza,  subs, & barbecue in rolesville, nc   27571-9357 
i purchase this product from authentic in bulk  for my restaurant to make gf pizza and it is by far the best gf pizza dough out  there. we get rave reviews from our customers on how soft the crust is and delicious.  no cardboard crust here!! the mix is pretty good for most people watching  ingredients, although yeast is needed. make it in advance and allow to  rehydrate well and then make the crust. i guarantee you will be happy with it!!
