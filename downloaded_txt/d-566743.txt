no cosmetics can restore lost youth but, if they are used correctly and professionally, they can help any woman to look considerably better. this was the conviction of rosa graf, who in the 1920’s was already running one of germany’s first institutes of cosmetics, and on whose convictions the company still continues to build. and it is this principle that has always guided rosa graf cosmetics’ work to this very day. we are constantly offering the beauty professionals new methods of treatment and ever more effective products for them to pass on to their customers.
