 vicksburg's old court house museum 










 



located in vicksburg, ms the old court house museum has showcased vicksburg's cultural history for 74 years. originally built in 1858, the building served as warren county's courthouse until 1939 when the new courthouse was completed. 

through the efforts of mrs. eva whitaker davis, a historical society was formed in 1946 with the sole ambition of transforming the abandoned structure into a museum of local history.  a national historic landmark and vicksburg's crown jewel, the museum is filled with items of historical and cultural significance from pre-columbian artifacts to fine portraits, furniture, china, silver, toys, tools, clothing, and one of the largest collections of civil war memorabilia in the south.
