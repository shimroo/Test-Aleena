which one is the king? it seems 
                    so obvious.. but wait... the king disappears and a pesky joker 
                    is found in it's place! here's one that'll make you a few 
                    bucks on the street.

                  one. plus, learn the little-known secret for making it 10 times 
                  more convincing! 

scarf through neck
an impromptu trick where you wrap a scarf around your neck, 
                  then it penetrates right through! do it with a rope, a scarf, 
                  or a tie. 

hindu shuffle top control
a quick and easy way to get any card to look like it's shuffled 
                  in the deck, yet it comes to the top! 



jokers find the card
you guessed it! the magician gets to take a little break 
                  while the jokers do all the work and find the card (but you'll 
                  get all the credit). 

color changing aces
the four aces quickly and visually change places. catch 
                  your audience off guard! we love this! 

change machine
wrap a dollar into folded pieces of paper, and when you 
                  unwrap it, the dollar is gone and there are four quarters in 
                  its place. 



quick coin vanish
one of the quickest coin vanishes in the world! just rub 
                  a coin into the table and it's gone! 

card change
a cornerstone of card magic, you'll learn how to do a perfect 
                  double-lift every time. one result of this - a card changes 
                  in the spectators hand. 

the french drop
make a coin or other object disappear with this sleight 
                  of hand move. learn it once, and use it for a lifetime. 



the name force
you start dealing cards face down into a pile. when your 
                  friend says stop, you immediately flip the card up and it has 
                  their name written on it! deck can be examined! a great personal 
                  opening trick. 

the fingernail force
your friend runs their fingernail down the deck and stops 
                  at any point. the card they stop on is the exact card you knew 
                  in advance! quick and foolproof. 

the snap change
visibly change a card with just a snap! an instant visual 
                  card change! pow! 



fusion
two strings melt together into one. perform it in your hand, 
                  or melt them together in your audience member's fist. people 
                  who aren't magicians just love this! 

the hurricane trick
the best "pick a card" trick in the world. card 
                  is selected, shuffled into the deck and then found - you can 
                  even find the card blindfolded or behind your back! 

vanishing cards
pull a card out of thin air, then make it disappear. a great 
                  stunt with a business card!
                  (a customer contacted us to let us know he recently got a job 
                  because of this trick - he impressed his new boss so much, he
