                            "the packaging hygiene booklets and posters i 
                            have recently purchased from you have proved to be 
                            exactly what i have been looking for as part of our 
                            iso9001 and brc/iop systems. hygiene training is a 
                            key part of our induction training for new staff and 
                            operators, along with the programme of refresher training 
                            across the site for all existing people. previous 
                            training has been based on food hygiene practices 
                            which, while thorough and mostly appropriate, were 
                            not specific to our industry. searches on the internet 
                            proved unsuccessful for packaging specific hygiene 
                            training aids, until finding the saferpak website. 
                            as such, the posters and booklets which target issues 
                            and practices specific to the packaging industry have 
                            now been integrated into our training programmes, 
                            both on the individual level, and as a promotional 
                            tool across the site. please keep me posted on any 
                            further developments."

                            "our site manufactures packaging which is so 
                            common that virtually all of the households across 
                            the uk will have some of it present within their kitchen. 
                            obviously it is imperative that we supply this packaging 
                            with no hidden surprises and awareness training is 
                            something close to my heart, unfortunately ever increasing 
                            restrictions on available time for me to personally 
                            perform this training means that this area has slowly 
                            been neglected. to find a training tool like the 'the 
                            fundamentals of food packaging hygiene' was a wish 
                            come true! after reading through a free sample of 
                            the 'food packaging hygiene - raising the standard' 
                            booklet, i immediately placed an order so that each 
                            employee would receive a copy. i was pleased to have 
                            found something that covered virtually all aspects 
                            of our company's hygiene management system in one 
                            fell swoop. when i discovered that a cd was available 
                            by the same company i ordered my copy that very same 
                            week as i knew that the quality would be good. on 
                            receipt of the disc i set about taking each supervisor 
                            through it and we are now running a training programme 
                            where each employee sits through the contents of the 
                            disc at a time that is more suitable to them. as a 
                            company that works 24/7 we have times during the night 
                            and at weekends when employees may be freed from their 
                            jobs for a period and this is the perfect tool to 
                            make the best use of this time. if anyone is in a 
                            similar position to me, where other commitments make 
                            it difficult for you to plan and perform training, 
                            i recommend that you buy a copy."

                            "your publication is a perfect compliment 
                            to the h & s and hygiene training given to staff. 
                            what i most liked about it was the very simplistic 
                            way in which the message is got over. please keep 
                            us in touch with any future relevant publications."

                            fully developed food safety training package for the 
                            packaging sector, talking to colleagues it is hard 
                            to find booklets or a package for food safety training 
                            for our sector we usually have to tailor actual food 
                            training packages - and then get confused looks from 
                            our operators who make plastic food bags when it talks 
                            about raw and cooked foods! under the food packaging 
                            standards such as the rsph (royal society for the 
                            promotion of health) and the new brc/iop (british 
                            retail consortium / institute of packaging) training 
                            is required and your products would be well received 
                            by all striving for or in possession of the standards."

                            for product safety and hygiene. the booklets are given 
                            to each individual at the end of a 1 hour long training 
                            session.the content of the booklet reflects the seriousness 
                            of good hygiene practises in packaging whilst at the 
                            same time adding a bit of fun whilst learning and 
                            that is important. also, there are some good examples 
                            of personal hygiene illustrated by cartoons that help 
                            drive the message home. the feedback that i have had 
                            is that the booklet has been very well received and 
                            some people have said they can identify some of the 
                            cartoon characters as being their workmates ! we now 
                            have 2 plants who are certificated to the brc/iop 
                            technical standard and this booklet has made a positive 
                            contribution to the culture change necessary to meet 
                            those requirements. keep up the good work!"

                            to be informative and clearly demonstrate reasons 
                            for good hygiene practices. the training has been 
                            delivered to a small number of new employees on a

                            throughout the process which kept us informed of the

                            it was a relief to finally find an information booklet 
                            on hygiene aimed solely at the packaging industry. 
                            it will help us greatly in our quest for the brc/iop

                            employees and are using it for new employees induction. 
                            we found the booklet to be a very good way of getting 
                            the message across, of the importance of hygiene standards. 
                            its simple and to the point with use of funny graphics
