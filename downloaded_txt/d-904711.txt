we believe it’s imperative to operate with the upmost transparency and goodwill as it relates to helping companies find the right brand - we will only do business with people  who respect our values.we understand that domain value is something not taught in business school but we ask that you do some research on it before attempting to make contact or putting together an offer. the domains we sell vary from $10k-$10m usd+ (and the prices we have are backed by market data) - chances are that if the domain in question is a high use generic domain (or is in a very rare category like 3 letter .com), it will be priced between at least 250k-1m. if you don’t have this kind of capital laying around, we are open to talking financing (but only to accredited individuals). thank you for taking the time to read this.
