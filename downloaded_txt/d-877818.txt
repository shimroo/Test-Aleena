 shark's caddis larva 
juvinile
this is a very simple fly imitating the caddis larva. some may call it realistic fly, some will say impressionistic, but no matter what, the originator says with 100% certainty that it's a killer pattern and he has caught lots of fish with it in many different places.

perdigon - caddis pupae

 perdigon flies are extremely heavy, boasting a tungsten weighted bead.  they are also very smooth being coated by uv resin, so they get down deep in the water, to where the trout are very quickly.

since you got this far …

the gff money box
… i have a small favor to ask.
long story short
support the global flyfisher through several different channels, including paypal.
long story longer
the global flyfisher has been online since the mid-90's and has been free to access for everybody since day one – and will stay free for as long as i run it.
but that doesn't mean that it's free to run.
it costs money to drive a large site like this.
see more details about what you can do to help in this blog post.
