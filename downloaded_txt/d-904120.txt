composer & musician
as a self made artist, peter whiterose creates music in a rather intuitive way. he plays electric and acoustic guitars. but you could have found him a few times performing on bass guitar or keyboard also. peter composes music on guitar and keyboard and records on the mac. additional recordings, mixing and mastering are done in external studios, like chain gang studios, ekzakt studios, nightingale studios, sonare studios, swan studios. he learned himself playing guitar and composing music mostly by practicing and refining the skills.
genres
pop, rock, reggae, latin, lounge, nu-jazz, acid jazz, smooth jazz, new age, ambient, film music, dance, classical ...
songwriting
whether you're a professional performing artist, a&r, manager, film director, web designer or else and you need a hit song, a tune for a tv series or a film score, background music for a website or anything else that sounds great and original, contact peter's management via our contact link at the bottom.
the songs are available in almost any digital shop worldwide.

the artistpeter whiterose
peter whiterose is an artist who has been creating artwork for many years. he adores beauty and harmony in everything, thus working a lot with the golden proportion. as an artist with a holistic vision, he's interested in the spiritual possibilities of the human mind and in nature, natural health, inventions, all kinds of creativity. so was leonardo da vinci ... he doesn't believe in the idea of nationalities, nor in the good from organised religions. both seem to divide people and prevent world peace. peter thinks they will eventually disappear from this planet, leaving a peace that is based on inner consciousness instead of outer belief. he considers himself a world citizen or even a universe citizen. whiterose has always combined two artistic disciplines in his life: visual art and music.


music in the genes
his grandfather and his daughter play the violin and whiterose first picked up the electric guitar of a friend when he was about 15. since then he has played in bands like lhd, aquarius, lost paradise, and collaborated with musicians, singers and artists like dani caen, mark vann, ellen rossi, vã©ronique smets, willy kooyman, walter mets, vera mann, marco rosso (clouseau), karen damen (k3), ananta roosens (gotan project), satya, mitta van der maat, jacques smeets, benny claes, wim rodgers, jokke deneve, jo michel, piet van den heuvel, chemical steve, khaliq glover (michael jackson, prince) and others.
peter also composes songs for others. the styles vary from ear catching pop to classics, including rock, reggae, lounge, acid jazz, smooth jazz, nu jazz, new age, film music, web music, contemporary dance projects, etc. if you are looking for any music for your project, click the contact link at the bottom and ask. 
in his music, the natural harmony of notes and sounds takes an important place as well. "birds never sing false, do they?" says peter whiterose.

"music is the language that uses common vibrations which are present in all humans and other living beings. let's enjoy that possibility and concentrate on what unifies, rather than what separates us."

artist painter
his mother was a fashion designer. over the years his artwork has reached the world and touched the hearts of many people. with a realistic technique, he presents an intuitively experienced dimension, inspired by nature scenery, with a dominance of aesthetics. to whiterose the art of painting is the art of observing and understanding. and much more of course, like inspiration, vision, ...the futility of humans in the immense cosmos, the esoteric aspect of everyday subjects, the contrast and tension between light and darkness, yin & yang and the awareness of wonder in nature, those elements are visualised as intensively as possible. he developed several unique techniques of his own, resulting into a personal and recognisable style. in his fine art works, the intelligence within every living being is often lifted above the presumed level. this creates a poetic, meta-realistic world, admired by a big audience during various exhibitions. the harmony of colours is considered of high importance and according to whiterose, in their natural coherence they 're always eye-delighting. conscious of the materialising power of thoughts, he creates harmonic art that is in strong contrast with the flood of destructive ideas, images and information that is projected on us by people and society, every day. some call whiterose's artworks magic realism, or meta realism. some consider this as classical art, others say it's more contemporary art. someone even called it "painted synchronicity". it's just timeless. that's one more reason whiterose's paintings are steady art investments with increasing value. if you are interested in buying, dealing or exhibiting whiterose art, just click the contact button in the menu. even so for licensing pictures to use for posters, post cards, calendars, other print works, tiles, websites, brochures, leaflets, book covers, cd covers, dvd covers and booklets, etc.

                                    your art and music are both out-of-this world - in the best possible way.

i listened to your three music tracks â they are also beyond â out-of-this world â amazing ... and i read your bio. i resonate with what you write. 
i too consider myself to be a universe and universal citizen, and choose to hope that so much of what is dividing people from people will eventually diffuse into a peaceful inner consciousness. 
                                    
sending you love and light from australia. 
all the best
