their own society: prose on poetry gets
                praise from david wojahn in a letter to author roger mitchell. 
"your prose, in its quiet way, is a wonder, and
                your insights are always spot on. even the shortestâ ofâ the
                pieces are filled with observations that always seem fresh, and
                your taste is so refreshingly catholic. and the longer essays
                rock--i don't think anyone has written better on mcgrath, or
                made a more persuasive case for his centrality. your various
                appraisalsâ ofâ modernism find a clear path through schools
                andâ movementsâ ofâ labyrinthineâ diversity. (no easy feat: over the
                dozen-odd times i've taught the modern poetry survey, i've never
                been able to come up withâ an adequate definition.) and the
                assessments or bly's influence couldn'tâ be more even-handed; you
                get at his genius, his myopia, and his hucksterism. reading the
                bly stuff, i found myself thinkingâ ofâ ofâ stein's
                characterizationâ ofâ pound: she called him a village explainer.
                you take him seriously, but not too seriously."
â 
david wojahn teaches atâ virginia commonwealth
                universityâ and at vermont college of fine arts. hisâ interrogation
                  palace: new and selected poemsâ 1982-2004, was one of
                three named finalists for the pulitzer prize. university of
                michigan press published hisâ from the valley of making:
                  essays on the craft of poetryâ in 2015. he is currently an
                editor-at-large for ron slate'sâ on the seawall.
roger mitchell is the author of twelve books of
                poems. their own society is his second book of prose, a
                selection of essays and reviews. retired from indiana
                university, he now lives in jay, new york, with his wife, the
                fiction writer, dorian gossy.
