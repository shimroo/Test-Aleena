eel program






the environmentally endangered lands (eel) program


administrative office hours of operation: monday through friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. closed staurday and sunday.





the environmentally endangered lands (eel) program was established in 1990 to protect the natural habitats of brevard county by acquiring environmentally sensitive lands for conservation, passive recreation, and environmental education.this was made possible by citizens who voted to tax themselves for the acquisition and maintenance of brevard’s natural areas. residents reaffirmed the eel program in
    2004 under a second referendum to protect the natural habitats within brevard county by the acquisition of environmentally sensitive lands through a willing seller program for the purpose of conservation, passive recreation, and environmental education.to stretch these funds as far as possible, the eel program forms partnerships with federal, state and local agencies that are committed to the protection of natural resources and our long-term quality
    of life. eel sanctuaries are managed to preserve native habitats and the plants and animals that live there.
