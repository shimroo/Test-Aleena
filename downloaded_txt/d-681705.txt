 project objectives 






city directories, arguably one of the most over-looked resources by genealogists, have been around since the 1700s.  this web site will attempt to identify all printed, microfilmed, and online directories, and their repositories, for the united states.  this site will answer these questions: does a directory exist for a locality?  if it does, where can it be found?
your help is needed!  is your library or archive a repository of any directories?  do you know of online transcriptions that aren't listed here?  click here to learn how you or your society can contribute.
