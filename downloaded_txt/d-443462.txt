why focus® ?






the focus 2 experience

focus 2 guides users through a reliable, intuitive career and education decision making model to help them choose a college, select a major, explore occupations, make informed career decisions and take action in their career development.

how users benefit

focus 2 provides valid and reliable assessments including work interests-holland code, personality, values, skills, leisure interests and career planning readiness. assessment results are matched to supporting majors and career options with over 1000 occupations and up-to-date career information. with our bold new look and cutting edge functionality, the focus 2 systems can be used on all devices.

dynamic administrators' website

real time user results with detailed individual career portfolios, powerful aggregate usage reports, multiple administrators and customizing options.

created by the experts

the focus 2 systems reflect the ground-breaking work of nationally prominent psychologists, dr. frank j. minor of ibm, dr. donald super, considered by many to be the founding father of career development, dr. roger myers and dr. david tiedeman, both former presidents of the apa counseling division, and dr. david campbell of the campbell-strong interest inventory.
focus 2 has been fully certified in meeting the highest level of standards established by the association for computer-based systems for career information and conforms to criteria established by the national career development association and the u.s. department of labor.





















what people have to say


we have been using the focus 2 explore program since 2006.  we have found it to be user friendly.  our students find it easier to use than other programs and it has much more information.   parents especially like how the student can find colleges based on what the student requires from a college.  it gives us a way to monitor our students' progress.

focus 2 career provides a great starting point for students who are overwhelmed about the choices that are out there for programs of study.

central penn is a career-focused college and does not admit students with undeclared majors.  nevertheless, exposing students to focus 2 in freshman seminar has allowed us to effectively counsel students who were in the wrong major.  this has led to increased satisfaction among those students.

i am indeed happy to write a testimonial on the use of focus 2 apply here at erie community college. we use it with high school students who are looking to plan a pathway into a major here at erie community college. we have done several internal assessments on the use of focus 2 by our students and have found it to be very useful in their decision making process.

i use focus 2 with all different groups of students - including visiting high school juniors and seniors who have no idea where to begin! provides a great starting point for users who are overwhelmed about the choices that are out there for programs of study.

focus 2 apply has helped our college more effectively support our prospective students. it is self-led, easy to navigate and the reporting tools enable us to more easily determine student status and tailor additional service and support based on that status, such as providing assistance in selecting a major.

the reliability and validity of the instrument impressed us the most, with the positive responses from students. the personalized report for students is very thorough. this system allows effective tracking reports. focus 2 is customized to your university curriculum thus providing a great tool for student retention.
