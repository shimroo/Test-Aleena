we love la
tourism is a vitally important way to support our community as we come together to help those who have been impacted by the wildfires. on behalf of the 540,000 angelenos working in tourism, we welcome you to visit our city of angels. the vast majority of la’s landmarks, attractions, restaurants, and hotels are open and safely welcoming guests. we urge visitors to be mindful of impacted areas and to travel responsibly. #welovela
