who we are

about us


metalplate galvanizing has over sixty years of hot-dip galvanizing experience and can trace its origin back to a small metal finishing shop in montgomery, alabama that was started in the mid-1930's. our lore states the shop “bronzed babies' booties and re-silvered rich ladies' teapots.” that operation eventually moved to birmingham, alabama where “there were more babies and rich ladies.” in response to customer requests and local need, metalplate began hot-dip galvanizing in birmingham in 1949.
