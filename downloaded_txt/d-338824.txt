24'x24' detached garage






		are you ready for a new garage?

		 


the perimeter is excavated to the 
		correct depth and a footer is poured.

with the block wall in place we 
		prepare for the floor.




		placing the concrete floor


		power trowel the concrete for a smooth finish




building your garage... we prepared and partially build your garage a week 
in advance at our shop in lancaster, pa. we frame up the walls, cut all the 
sheathing, install the windows and doors (the overhead doors are installed on 
site) and load our trailer. when we arrive on the first day things happen very 
fast. because we have prebuilt many of your new garages components all week 
prior to arriving our on site installation schedule is usually (2) days! we time 
things to happen through out the day. for example, the walls will be up before 
11am because we have a truss set at 11:30. your roof shingles will be "shot" up 
to the roof at 1:00pm. we break into teams as the job advances. roofing, siding, 
overheads are some of the assignments for members of our crew.
(2) days install
here are the plans before we built







we handle all the inspections with the 
		building department. although we are only on site at your home for 4-5 
		days please expect close to (3) months for the whole process. 
		engineering and permits are the big time killers, thanks!
