“our campground shower stalls look terrific.”

“thanks for meeting our deadline, the new toilet stalls upgraded our school’s appearance.”
larry
“with manning’s assistance, the toilet partition installation went off without a hitch.”
craig
“the privacy hardware for our bathroom partitions was a hit with all of our employees.”
dr. joachim
“i’m 100% satisfied with both product and customer service. i maintain 12 buildings aging from 1680 to 1984; the older ones are sometimes easier to care for. this was my first toilet stall job and first time with manning materials. the install went well considering the lack of level or square in the area. the partition design allowed for the flexibility i needed. it was a fun puzzle to work on. it definitely looks durable and easy to clean which were the two qualities desired. working with manning materials through the calls and e-mails to amy were easy, helpful and pleasant. i work with many companies, this one make the top in good experience. thank you!”
