harmonica superstart

harmonica superstart has been taught live to thousands of students and is a proven effective system for quickly learning the harmonica.
this is a play-by-colors system with a patented superstart card that goes onto your harmonica so you can actually see what you are playing – and play right away.
harmonica superstart takes advantage of the way the diatonic harmonica was originally designed to be played – playing with chords (more than one note at a time).
this is a very different approach than all the other harmonica instructions you’ll encounter.
most require you immediately to try to play one note at a time, which can be frustrating and usually does not sound very good for quite a while.
with harmonica superstart you will be playing music right away and sounding good, too – just follow the system step-by-step and you’ll be well on your way.
