red wing dinnerware: a brief history
buds salad plate
red wing had been producing the finest utilitarian stoneware items, using locally-sourced clay, since the late 1870’s.  in the mid-1930’s, the company decided to import a finer-bodied clay, and transform their ceramic production into art pottery and dinnerware.  the introduction of refrigeration some years before was eating into stoneware sales; they needed an alternative to boost sales and dinnerware fit the bill.
initially, patterns were bright solid colors; later patterns were hand painted and some of the last patterns used stencils.   dinnerware production numbers and sales were closely monitored, and as a result, individual patterns and pieces within a line were quickly added and dropped.
for a time, the red wing potteries made special-order dinnerware items for customers such as hamm’s, diamond jim’s and sweden house.
