herbal cancer treatments 
knowing your time and your
                      life are valuable to you and those you love, we have
                      done everything possible to make your visit to this
                      site worthwhile. we know how critical your issues are,
                      and we know that truth and honesty are crucial to good
                      decisions and happy outcomes. 




 information
approximately 80% of the world's population
                  depends exclusively on plants for their health and healing.
                  in the developed world, reliance on surgery and pharmaceutical
                  medicine is more usual, but increasingly, more and more
                  people are complementing their treatment with natural supplements.
on this site, there are over 100 pages
                  that provide only information.
                  there are also about 30 pages that discuss herbs
                  and herbal products that can be used to support different
                  aspects of cancer treatment. though some of the products
                  are available to practitioners through sacred medicine
                  sanctuary, there is no sales pitch, merely intelligent
                  explanations of the herbal remedies as they have been used
                  by skilled practitioners historically and in the present.
 a wealth of material on
                  diet, life style, and psychospiritual approaches to healing
                  that can be used in conjunction with cancer treatment can
                  also be found on this site though much of this material
                  is being transferred to cancerchecklist.com where
                  the scope of discussion is wider.

 artemisia

 press release from
                    environmental news network on wormwood!
 mistletoe
mistletoe has
                  held interest as a possible anticancer agent since the
                  1920’s. this is because extracts derived from it
                  have been shown to kill cancer cells and to stimulate the
                  immune system.

 pros
                    and cons
the pros
                    and cons of botanical treatments are thoroughly discussed
                    in the book and
                    in somewhat lesser detail on this site. while every effort
                    has been made to provide accurate information on the
                    herbal products described in the book, the only real
                    way to ascertain the effectiveness of the historic approaches
                    to cancer treatment was to re-create the products and
                    try them. sacred medicine
                    sanctuary has taken on this task and has made several
                    of the internal tonics as well as a number of ointments
                    and supportive remedies on an experimental basis. this
                    includes a variation of the hoxsey tonic.
                    no escharotic products such as the black salve or compound
                    x can be purchased on this site, but sources for
                    them are listed.
 
 
 book
 





                  the methods described in ingrid naiman's book cancer
                  salves: a botanical approach to treatment were
                  traditionally used mainly for breast tumors and skin cancers,
                  but they have been successfully employed for a wide variety
                  of other malignancies, including pancreatic, liver, and
                  kidney cancer. derivative treatments can be used for uterine-cervix and brain cancer
                  as well as many abnormal conditions affecting the lymphatic system.
                  the internal
                  tonics, often regarded as more important than the external,
                  can be used as either primary or adjunctive treatment for
                  most cancers.

 bulletin
                      boards and discussion forums

there are three bulletin boards associated
                    with this public service. there is one for posting
                    questions that replaces the faq and previous pages
                    devoted to questions and answers. there is another where
                    patients can discuss their
                    experiences and share both the fruits and perils of their
                    healing quest. this board is only for patients. there
                    is another board that
                    is strictly for practitioners. there is also a board on
                    cancerchecklist.com that is rarely used but freely available.
 


 parasites

hulda clark's book the
                    cure for all cancers sold millions of copies.
                    she, like many others before her, was convinced that
                    parasites are a critical factor in the development as
                    well as treatment of cancer.

 new
                    pages 
there is a page where new posts are listed.
                  these posts usually address questions that arise because
                  of media attention to an alternative cancer treatment,
                  such as is currently the case with mistletoe and iscador.
