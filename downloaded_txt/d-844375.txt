the
physics





                  of liquid friction is still pretty sketchy. 
                  unlike solid friction, velocity and surface area are
                  major considerations.  this tutorial compares
                  these two forms of friction and goes into some detail
                  about each.

                  is a farce!  it is all about the velocity added
                  by a pump's impeller.  this tutorial dispells
                  this myth and explains the relationship of velocity to
                  the three affinity laws.

                lower flow nonclogs - solids handling options
 
              there are times when pumps installed in lower flow
              applications need the ability to pass a full 3" spherical
              solid.  should you install a 4" pump and run to the
              left of the performance curve?  probably not. 
              this tutoral provides several options that will enhance
              pump life.

                vortex action - how lower efficiency can reduce cost
 
              vortex pumps have a bad reputation in the engineering
              community because of their low hydraulic efficiency. 
              it turns out that their lower maintenance will often
              substantially reduce overall operating costs even though
              electrical costs may be slightly higher.  this
              tutorial explains vortex action and provides several
              examples that show why this type of pump may be a better
              choice.

              for vfd operation.  part 1 addresses constant
              pressure / variable flow while part 2 addresses variable
              pressure / variable flow.  part 3 adds an elevation
              or constant pressure component to variable pressure /
              variable flow.

                  lift station level control - almost utopia

              back in the old days level control had nothing to do with
              saving energy.  in fact it was often a necessary
              evil.  with the advent of the vfd you may be able to
              achieve relatively constant flows and reduce the energy
              required.  this tutorial investigates the
              possibilities.

                comparing energy consumption - to vfd or not to vfd
 
              if the goal of your vfd application is to reduce energy
              consumption, you have to do a careful comparison between
              vfd and constant speed operation.  this tutorial uses
              a constant pressure application to show you the proper way
              to do that comparison.

                variable frequency control - other advantages
 
              vfd's can reduce energy consumption by allowing a pump to
              run at the duty point required by the system and it can
              change that duty point in real time.  but they offer
              several other advantages that can often justify their use
              even if pump speed is not varied.  this tutorial
              explores those other advantages.

                balancing voltage & frequency - fluxuating flux
 
              we all know that a vfd varies the frequency seen by an
              electric motor.  that is how it varies the motor
              speed.  but, did you know that it must also vary the
              voltage?  if it did not, the magnetic field produced
              by the stator would become saturated and torque would
              become unreliable.  this tutorial explains the volts
              / hertz relationship that must be maintained by the vfd.

                resonant frequency & critical speed
 
              the vibration that occurs in a pumping system due to
              resonance is not a good thing.  resonance arrises
              when a variable speed pump reaches a critical speed. 
              it turns out that the first or lowest critical speed can
              be easily calculated from simple data provided by the
              manufacturer.  this tutorial explores resonant
              frequency and shows how to calculate the speed that causes
              it.

                pump field test calculator 
 
              the 2013 version of my field test calculator allows
              detailed testing of pumps in the field.  there are
              four different tabs that directly address testing of above
              ground centrifugals (suction & discharge gauge
              method), submersible wastewater (discharge gauge method)
              and lineshaft turbines (discharge gauge method). 
              after entering the required data the calculator will
              calculate velocity, velocity head, tdh, average voltage,
              average current, unbalanced voltage and current, water hp,
              test point hp, pump efficiency and the cost per 1000
              gallons pumped.  if multiple points are tested an h/q
              test curve is generated automatically on page 3.  all
              equations used for calculations are shown on the
              spreadsheet.  complete instructions are
              included.  see my jan 2011 and may 2014 pumps &

wastewater pump draw down
                calculator

draw down is a common
                  technique for evaluating wastewater pump
                  performance.  this simple, excel program
                  standardizes the measurement process and also
                  calculates tdh.  both flow and tdh are required
                  to evaluate pump performance and locate the operating
                  point on the pump h/q curve.  discharge velocity
                  head is also calculated and included in the tdh
                  calculation.  see my december 2011 pumps &
                  systems article for more information.  the
                  drawdown combo calculator is designed for older wells
                  that use a partition to accommodate both wet and dry
                  pits in the same well.  a drawing on the sheet
                  explains their use.

                pump & motor hp at lower frequencies
 
              when pump speed is reduced, the required hp reduces as the
              cube of the change in speed.  when a vfd reduces
              motor speed the available hp is also reduced.  in
              cases where lower hp motors are used to run a pump at some
              maximum frequency, it is important to make sure that the
              hp available at that frequency is sufficienct.  this
              calculator will show you the required vs available
              hp.  see my january 2013 pumps & systems article

            the tutorials


the tutorials and topics presented
          here were developed over the past twenty years.  several
          were written for my own employees in an effort to further
          their understanding of the equipment and applications that
          were our life's blood.  others were written specifically
          for specifying engineers so that they could gain an unbiased
          understanding of different options.  but, most were
          developed to provide information for the overall pump
          community.  so far, they have been well received and i
          have shared them via one web site or another since 1997.
           many emails from around the world have offered
          compliments, corrections, and suggestions.  please keep
          them coming.

some are short and simple -- "the
          self priming pump", for example, gives a brief overview of
          self priming pumps and the applications for which they are
          intended.  these will usually reference another tutorial
          for more detailed study.  others, like "ac power", are
          far more detailed and present a thorough overview from
          generation to consumption.  "hertz" and "hpsa", on the
          other hand, are designed to be interactive learning and sizing
          tools.  "centrifugal pump dynamics" is html based and
          uses animations to get its points across.  my "pumps
          & systems" magazine articles offer a short review of a
          broad range of pump, motor and control topics.  some of
          the "two part" articles, such as "power factor" provide an in
          depth review.

the "puzzler" is a totally different
          animal.  it uses the findings of simple physics to help
          explain some of the every day and, even more complex phenomena
          that we encounter in  pumping applications.  i
          developed the puzzler as the basis for my weekly "lunch &
          learn" seminars that i presented to my employees.  the
          beauty of the "puzzler" is that it promotes learning rather
          than memorization.  for example, why memorize a fact such
          as -- the head produced by a centrifugal pump changes as the
          square of a change in speed -- when the "falling body"
          equation shows you why?

if you have questions or
          suggestions, please drop me an email.

 the
          puzzler - joe evans, ph.d  
have you ever wondered why the
          pressure of a fluid flowing in a pipe decreases as its
          velocity increases? could it have something to do with why
          airplane's fly? why does 115 volts plus 115 volts equal 230
          volts in some cases, but only 208 volts in others? doesn't the
          pressure that a liquid exerts have anything to do with its
          volume? when is a watt not a volt-amp?  is centrifugal
          force really a farce?   how come liquid friction, but not
          solid friction, is affected by velocity and surface area?
if you find these and other
          questions relating to pumps, motors, and electricity
          especially titillating, you are going to love the puzzler. the
          puzzler poses a pointed question, but that question is just
          the tip of the iceberg! the discussion that follows explores
          not only the question but also the physics surrounding it.
the current puzzler series consists
          of more than forty brain teasers designed to expand your
          knowledge of mechanics, hydraulics, and electricity.  the

          constant
          pressure
          booster systems -
          joe evans, ph.d

this
                tutorial will allow you to enter the realm of constant
                pressure and the booster systems that support it.
                 it starts with a brief overview of the
                differential pressure booster and then takes a look at
                prv controlled simplex, duplex, and triplex constant
                pressure systems.  from there it moves on to vfd
                control and the advantages it can offer.  topics
                covered include tank vs tankless systems, sequencing,
                pressure vs flow control, and pump selection.  if
                you are unfamiliar with the vfd, download "variable
                frequency 101"  as you will need an understanding
                of their operation for the second half of this
                discussion.

 the ac
          induction motor  - joe evans, ph.d
this
                introduction is intended for those with little or no
                background in electric motors. it begins with the very
                basics including magnetism, direct current, and the
                operation of a simple dc motor. from there it moves on
                to alternating current, induction, and the operation of
                a simple ac motor. it concludes with a discussion of
                work, torque, and horsepower. it is an excellent primer
                for some of the electrical "puzzlers".  for a more
                comprehensive review of induction motors, see my five
                part series (march - july 2011) on the "pumps &

 the
          single phase
          induction motor - joe evans,
          ph.d
the major
            difference in single and three phase motors is that the
            single phase motor requires some sort of starting mechanism
            to get it rotating.  this overview looks at four of the
            most popular starting (and two running) techniques and the
            pros and cons of each.  it also includes a discussion
            of single and three phase rotational fields.  it is
            aimed at the pump professional who works with single phase
            submersible wastewater pumps, well pumps, and small
            centrifugals.  for a more comprehensive
                review of induction motors, see my five part series

 ac
          power - joe evans, ph.d
why is ac power the
            standard in the us?  what is the difference between
            single phase and three phase sine waves?  why does a
            voltmeter read 115v, 230v, or 460v when the actual voltage
            is quite a bit higher?  how does a transformer work?
            what is the difference between wye & delta versions?
             do resistive and inductive circuits behave
            differently?  what is power factor and what does it
            have to do with reactance?  how can capacitive
            reactance be used to correct the problems caused by
            inductive reactance? this short course is designed for the
            pump professional who wants to gain a basic understanding of
            ac power and its application to electric motors.  see my
            june through september 2010 pumps & systems magazine

                invention of the ac induction motor?  this short
                introduction will help the pump professional gain an
                understanding of their inner workings, potential
                problems, and some of the applications for which they
                are well suited. topics include: the relationship
                between frequency and motor windings (poles), pulse
                width modulation (pwm) output, effective voltage,

 centrifugal pump motor selection,
            installation, & start up - joe evans, ph.d
 the vast
              majority of failures of new electric motors can be
              attributed to improper selection, installation, and start
              up. although factory defects do occur, they are rare and
              are quite apparent upon tear down and inspection.  this short
            publication is a guide to the proper selection,
            installation, and start up of new and replacement
            centrifugal pump motors.  (this tutorial was updated on

 air vs oil
          filled sewage pump motors - joe evans, ph.d 
some
              manufacturers believe that filling a motor with oil is the
              only way to go while others think air to be a better
              solution (pun intended). this paper takes an honest look
              at these two popular submersible sewage pump motor designs
              and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each.
              topics covered include motor efficiency, heat transfer,
              bearing lubrication, maintenance, and environmental
              concerns.

 pressure sewer systems:  centrifugal
            vs positive displacement - joe evans, ph.d
during
the





              past thirty years, low pressure grinder pump sewer systems
              have become a popular alternative to traditional gravity
              systems. the two basic pump designs, centrifugal and
              positive displacement, used in these systems are as
              different as night and day. this short article discusses
              the operating characteristics of centrifugal and positive
              displacement grinder pumps when installed in a pressure
              sewer system.  topics covered include pipeline
              velocity, unvarying vs dynamic flow, self limiting system
              pressure, operating power, and impeller / cutter design.

              and down.  it also asks for the hydraulic
              efficiencies for each of the flow points and, in return,
              prints the hp required as "data lables" on each of the
              frequency curves.  this allows you to quickly

              speed (ns).  but as operation moves away from bep
              (especially to the left) the net radial thrust increses
              quickly.  unbalanced radial thrust can cause
              increased shaft deflection which can lead to increased
              seal, bearing, and wear ring wear.  in some cases it
              can cause the shaft to break.  this calculator allows
              you to quickly calculate the radial thrust in psi at any
              point on a pump's h/q curve.  see my
            jan 2010 pumps & systems magazine article for additional
            information.

            pieces of information that can be used to identify pumps
            that are prone to cavitation due to suction recirculation
            are suction specific speed (s) and suction energy
            (se).  this calculator will allow you to calculate
            both.  for more information on s see terry henshaw's

 vfd pump selection
            - constant pressure - joe evans, ph.d

  
 
this





                    tutorial goes into a fair amount of detail
                    concerning the proper selection of booster pumps for
                    vfd applications.  it starts by comparing a prv
                    controlled booster with one under vfd control and
                    then outlines five rules that should be followed
                    during pump selection.  it ends with examples
                    of good and poor selections.  another

with





                    this tutorial, we begin our discussion of
                    applications that require varying flows but do not
                    require constant pressure. circulation is one of the
                    more popular variable speed applications for many
                    reasons.  we begin with a discussion of closed
                    loop applications, show a typical system curve, and
                    then illustrate the pump curves used for single and
                    variable speed operation.  we then move on to
                    open loop systems and provide  similar

                        this tutorial, we take a close look at waste
                        water pump down applications and show how they
                        can often benefit from conversion to level
                        control.  we begin with a discussion of wet
                        and dry pit installations and show an example of
                        the pumps used in pump down applications.
                         we then show the same pump operating in a
                        level control environment.  we end with
                        some guidelines on pump selection.

                            centrifugal pumps.  it can be presented
                            in as little as an hour or as a morning or
                            afternoon class if you go into more

                            as the title implies, this tutorial presents
                            the basic mechanics and hydraulics of
                            centrifugal pump operation.  it begins
                            by dispelling the myth of "centrifugal
                            force" and shows that acceleration of a
                            fluid is its sole purpose.  it then
                            moves on to a discussion of the pump "curve"
                            and shows examples of series and parallel
                            operation.  it touches on specific
                            gravity and why we typically rate pump
                            performance in feet of head.  we review
                            the laws of affinity and illustrate them
                            with a pump operating under vfd
                            control.  we finish with a discussion
                            of suction conditions and liquid friction.

                                that allows you to evaluate a
                                submersible or dry pit pump that will be
                                used in a level control
                                application.  you can enter up to

                                performance curve and then view its
                                operating curves from 30 to 60 hz. 
                                if you enter a system curve and the
                                "pump down" elevation you can also view
                                the same pump operating in a pump down

cavitation





                            - a largely misunderstood phenomenon
-
                            joe evans, ph.d

  
 
the goal of this tutorial is
                                to help you gain a intuitive
                                understanding of the cavitation process
                                and its causes.  i
                                will leave its prevention to the many
                                articles that already exist.  since boiling
                                is the precursor to cavitation, we begin
                                by taking a look at some of the
                                properties of water and their role in
                                the cavitation process. 




                                we then put npsh into perspective
                                and  review
                                some of the dynamics of centrifugal pump
                                operation that also directly affect the
                                process.  we
                                conclude with a discussion of the
                                different types of centrifugal pump
                                cavitation and the conditions that can
                                cause them to occur.  another

                                    attacks.  it is sad that such a
                                    useful science has gotten such a bad
                                    rap.  but, quite frankly, you

new comers to the

                                        for some time to come.  the
                                        primary purpose of alternative
                                        starting techniques is to reduce
                                        the system loading during

                                        is about five to seven times

positive displacement

there are
                                            many pump designs that fall
                                            into the positive
                                            displacement category but,
                                            for the most part, they can
                                            be nicely divided into two
                                            basic groups.  the
                                            reciprocating group operates
                                            via pistons, plungers, or
                                            diaphragms while rotary
                                            pumps use gears, lobes,

i really
                                                had to think long and
                                                hard about putting this
                                                up on my web site. 
                                                hopefully you will never
                                                have to use it but, it
                                                can allow you to size a

                                                several "family" curves
                                                that are made up of

series / parallel
            pumping analyzer with autoplot - joe evans, ph.d

  
 
the resulting pressure and flows obtained
                when identical pumps are operated in series or parallel
                can be intuitively obvious. but, when those pumps are
                not identical, our analog brains often need to see a
                graphical presentation of those results.  the
                series / parallel calculator is an excel program that
                allows you to view the combined performance curves of
                identical and similar pumps when running in series and
                parallel installations.  it also allows you to
                enter a system curve so that you can  evaluate
                their performance.  after you download and start
                the program, scroll down for detailed instructions and a
                description of the example that is included.

vfd pump selection - frequency vs rpm ? - joe evans, ph.d

 
  
 
i receive several emails each month asking why
              my vfd sizing programs (hertz, hertz vhf, hpsa, &
              ppsa) show the resulting curves in hz rather than
              rpm.  this short paper explains my reasoning.

            centrifugal pump efficiency - what, how, why, when ?
- joe evans, ph.d
 
  


in
this





                tutorial, we will investigate several aspects of
                centrifugal pump efficiency.  first




                i will define efficiency and give some examples.  next we will examine some of
                the design criteria that ultimately dictate the
                efficiency exhibited by a particular pump. 





                we will also try to make that somewhat nebulas
                quantity, known as specific speed, more meaningful.  i will also show its effect on
                the shape of a pumps performance and power curves.  finally, we will discuss the
                importance of (or, sometimes, unimportance) of
                efficiency as it relates to a particular application or
                process.  we will also
                illustrate the relationship of efficiency, head, and
                flow as they apply to both steep and flat performance
                curves and their roles in constant and variable speed
                applications.  we will end
                with a brief look at the combined efficiency of a pump
                and its driver.  for a more recent look at this
                topic see my feb through july 2012 pumps & systems
                magazine articles.

              waterhammer - its all about conserving energy - joe evans, ph.d

 
  


most of us are
                  familiar with the phenomenon known as waterhammer
                  (water hammer) but few realize how destructive its
                  force can be.  neither can we visualize some of
                  the events that lead to its inception and those that
                  occur afterwards.  did you know that waterhammer
                  is a real life example of one of physics' most
                  fundamental laws?  in this tutorial we will
                  investigate both the cause and effect of
                  waterhammer.  we will also look at several
                  methods of mitigating its damage and inception.

              educational seminars &  training 

 
  


the recipie for
                  pump ed 101's educational seminars and training is a
                  simple one.  combine the subject matter with many
                  years of hands on experience, a dash of simple
                  physics, a bit of history, and a generous portion of
                  practical examples.  stir well and sprinkle with
                  interaction.  the result is a learning experience
                  for everyone involved, regardless of their prior
                  knowledge of the subject.

                  the seminars shown below have been presented to a wide
                  range of audiences over the past twenty years. 
                  they are updated continuously and the current power
                  point versions include lots of java based animations
                  that can often clarify many of those, otherwise,
                  subtle points.  my audiences include engineering
                  firms, refineries, utilities, awwa, wef, mea, ngwa,
                  rwa, and other pump oriented organizations.  drop
                  me an email if you are interested in an on site
                  seminar or have questions.

click below to download the pdf that describes
                    the seminars that are approved for ceu credits in
                    oregon, washington & idaho.  depending upon
                    the acrediting agency, presentations must be a
                    minimum of one or three hours.   half day
                    seminars can be a mix of various one hour
                    presentations.  seminars are sponsored by
                    pumptech and can be presented in washington, oregon,
                    idaho and parts of montana.

              centrifugal pump dynamics - joe evans, ph.d

 
  


"dynamics -
                  the branch of mechanics that deals with the motion and
                  equilibrium of systems under the action of forces
                  related to motion."  well, no wonder you have
                  never investigated this before - - it sounds pretty
                  boring!  but, believe or not, dynamics is
                  actually quite interesting (and simple) and it is the
                  key to understanding how centrifugal pumps work. 
                  this short tutorial will allow you to fully appreciate
                  what goes on inside those pumps - - all the way from
                  the inlet to the discharge.  i have chosen the
                  html format for this one so that i can take advantage
                  of some imbedded animations and links to several other
                  sites that will help us visualize what is going
                  on.  make sure that java and flash are
                  enabled.  it is also available as a pdf document
                  but you will not be able to take advantage of the
                  animations.  enjoy!

              anti vfd (beware of the nazi's)

 
as you search the web for more information on
              variable frequency applications you might get the feeling
              that we have reentered the era of pre wwii.  some of
              the sites out there profess that vfd's have no rightful
              place in our society and that there is no pump application
              worthy of their use.  most of these opinions come
              from those who offer competing products and they will show
              a pump curve or power analysis that proves that their
              product can always do a better job.  i have even read
              some tax payer sponsored research that goes way over the
              line.  one concluded that magnetic coupling systems
              offer power savings similar to that of vfd's.  this
              certainly may be true in some instances but, the data used
              in this particular study was so skewed even enron would
              have been concerned !

              the same thing can happen on the other side of the aisle -
              - but it is usually due to a lack of knowledge rather than
              deceit.  many of the vfd articles in the trade press
              tend to be written by vfd manufacturers.  and,
              although they have some pretty smart people, most have a
              limited knowledge of pump applications. therefore the
              examples given tend to be more theoretical than practical.

              here is a good rule of thumb:  no single application control technique
                will always be the best choice for a given
                application.  if





                  someone tells you that theirs is always best - - take
                  them off your "favorites" list.  in my variable
                  frequency tutorials, i try to use pump curves that are
                  more typical rather than one that is "perfect". 
                  this allows you to compare application results in a
                  more realistic light.

              pid control - what, why, how ? - joe evans, ph.d

 

the p
            (proportional) in pid is not too frightening but, what about
            those other two letters?  are not the integral and
            derivative parts of that mathematics known as
            calculus?  and, isn't calculus frightening?  well
            fear no more because this "layman's" discussion of pid
            control will help you understand what it is, why we use it,
            and how it works.  we start with a discussion of open
            and closed loop control and give examples of each.  we
            then move on to proportional control and the applications it
            supports.  we end with a discussion of the integral and
            derivative functions and how they can temper the, sometimes,
            unruly nature of the proportional controller.

              variable fixed speed control - float switch activation - joe evans, ph.d

 

so, your
            waste water application will not lend itself to level
            control operation.  or, maybe you just prefer float
            switches over transducers and ultrasonic devices. 
            whatever the reason, vfs or variable fixed speed control
            might be a viable alternative to that pump down
            application.  today you can combine an inexpensive vfd
            with standard float switch technology and get a multispeed
            pumping system that can increase application flexibility and
            efficiency.  this short tutorial takes a look at vfs
            control and how it compares to standard pump down
            applications.

              sdsca - simplex / duplex system curve analyzer - joe evans, ph.d

 

there can be
            times when we over estimate the flow expected during
            parallel operation of two non-clogs.  sdsca is an excel
            spread sheet that allows you to analyze the operation of the
            same non-clog running under simplex and duplex (parallel)
            operation.  it will generate a system curve based upon
            the information entered and give you the head required at
            design flow.  you can then enter the curve data for a
            selected pump and the simplex and duplex operational curves
            will be plotted against the system curve.  scroll down
            for detailed instructions.  the data used in the
            example can be found under the "notes" tab.

                  joe evans, ph.d

                the work i did prior to 1986 was quite different than
                what i do today.  i attended grad school (69 - 73)
                during an interesting era.  the advent of the
                minicomputer in the late 60's and early 70's allowed us
                to accomplish things that were impossible for those
                before us.  all of a sudden, data generated by
                scientific instruments (especially the gas chromatograph
                - mass spectrometer (gc-ms)) that used to take months to
                analyze provided results within days.  back then
                the typical minicomputer was the size of a filing
                cabinet and had 2 - 4 k of memory.  data storage
                was on paper tape or maybe mag tape if you were
                lucky.  it was still the time of the slide rule and
                analog recorders and just comparing the area under two
                plotted curves could take hours.  much of our work
                on instrument automation was sponsored by nasa and the
                robert a welch foundation. we were also chosen as one of
                the few labs to analyze the soil samples gathered by the
                first nasa lunar lander project.

                in 1973 i entered the army as captain and chief of the
                air chemistry branch of the army environmental hygiene
                agency.  this agency was the army's version of the
                epa/nih and its research was designed to protect our
                troops and reduce our impact on the environment. 
                one of our major projects at the time was monitoring the
                detoxification and disposal of our wwii nerve gas stock
                pile at rocky mountain arsenal (which, by the way, was
                stored for decades right at the end of the main runway
                of the old denver airport).  during my stay i
                continued my work on instrument automation and also the
                miniaturization of those instruments for use in the
                field.

                after leaving the army in 1975 i joined finnigan
                corporation, a major gc-ms developer and manufacturer of
                the era.   i was in charge of the east coast
                applications lab in washington dc and later moved into
                the position of product manager.  by the mid 70's
                the minicomputer had advanced substantially and this
                technology gave us the ability analyze the data provided
                by a gc-ms in real time - - not days.

                in 1977 i made the decision to move to hawaii and,
                except for the university of hawaii, there were no job
                opportunities that could make use of my past
                experience.  hawaii is a major union state and
                unfortunately this spilled over to the university and i
                doubted that i would fit in well in that
                environment.  so, on a lark, i changed directions
                and took a position with ibm.  oddly enough, my
                minicomputer experience paid off and over the next five
                years i worked in industrial automation as well as
                distributed processing in the business community. 
                one of our major accomplishments was the implementation
                of a on line directory assistance system at hawaiian
                telephone.  it was a distributed processing system
                that consisted of three layers of minicomputers and
                fixed head disk drives that could perform searches as
                deep as nine levels of indent in seconds.  
                the result was a directory assistance operator reduction
                of about two thirds which the union, of course, did not
                see this as a useful technological advance. 
                although it was nowhere near the speed of google, it was
                lightning fast for its day.

                in 1983, the queen's medical center (hawaii's largest
                healthcare organization) offered me the position of vp
                of information services.  i learned early on that
                accepting this job was a mistake as i was unaware of the
                politics and in fighting that went on in these
                "non-profit" organizations.  still, in less than
                three years we were able to take them to the forefront
                of the information age.  we were the first company
                in hawaii to employ personal computers instead of dumb
                terminals and we had our own "intranet" email system in
                early '84.  unfortunately continuing confrontations
                with the ceo (a psychiatrist who was having an affair
                with the head of nursing who had a striking resembalance
                to "miss piggy") led to my demise in late '85.

                in 1986 i accidentally fell into the pump
                industry.  and, as most of you know, once you are
                in this industry it is hard to escape!  below are
                several papers that i published or took part in prior to
                that fall.


                  isolation and partial characterization of supernatant
                  and mitochondrial shrimp muscle malate dehydrogenases

                this paper, published in comparative biochemistry &
                physiology (pergamon press), was a result of the
                research performed for my masters thesis.  it is
                co-authored by my advisor and two of my
                associates.  the work was sponsored by the national
                institutes of health and the robert a welch foundation.

                  program elal:  an interactive minicomputer based
                  elemental analysis of low & medium resolution mass
                  spectra

                this paper, published in analytical chemistry (american
                chemical society), was a result of some of my doctorial
                research and follow on work done at the u.s. army
                environmental hygene agency.  the program was the
                first to computerize the manual elemental analysis
                methods developed by dr. fred mclafferty at cornell
                university.

                  organic vapors

                this paper, published in  environmental science
                & technology (american chemical society), was a
                result of my continuing work at the u.s. army
                environmental hygene agency.  it discusses the
                ongoing micro-computerization and miniaturization of
                environmental monitoring instruments.  it was
                co-authored by jim arnold of varian associates, a
                physicist and major contributor to technology advances
                in mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance
                (nmr) spectrometry (now known as magnetic resonance
                imaging (mri) due to our ignorance and fear of that
                other "n" word).  the mass spectrometer described
                in this paper was the predecessor of the one that was
                aboard the mars lander.

user
                  written software extends the use of gc-ms data systems

                published in finnigan spectra (finnigan corporation),
                this article revisits the use of program elal and
                introduces a new program known as finl (fragment ion and
                neutral loss analysis).  finl automated another
                manual elemental analysis methodology that was developed
                by mclafferty at cornell university.

                in 1983 i left ibm and assumed the position of vp of
                information services at the queen's medical center in
                honolulu.  one of the first things that we did was
                to initiate a news letter to keep the employees of our
                almost 150 departments up to date on what we were
                doing.  this is the first issue.

the
                  queen's medical center - - a royal link to the past
                  and the future

                in late '83 we entered into an agreement with management
                science america (msa) to install their gl, ap, and
                payroll/personnel systems and their "peachpak"
                interactive pc products.  this article highlights
                our accomplishments over a period of just one year.

                in 1985, "today's office" (hearst business publications)
                selected queen's as one of the nation's leader's in
                office automation and asked me to write an article
                outlining what we had done to get there.  this was
                my last non-pump article!

your hawaiian retreat

 
  
 
my nephew hugh and his wife
                elvira own and operate a very different vacation rental
                outside pahoa, on the big island of hawaii, just 25
                miles north of the volcanos national park.  it
                offers ocean views in a truly rual environment.  in
                this area of the island, lava pools and black sand
                beaches rim the coast but just a few yards inland it
                becomes a beautiful forest.  they have several
                different units that can accomodate from two to fifteen
                people and will even provide three meals a day if you
                wish.  the rates - - outrageously
                inexpensive!  the picture below is of the ohana
                house.  for more information and a tour of the
                grounds, click on their web site link below.
