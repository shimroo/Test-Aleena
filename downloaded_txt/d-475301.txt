as a soil moisturizer or water system, watersmart  acts as a water reservoir 
									  for the soil. plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil, 
									  then as the potting soil dries, the water and nutrients stored and is released into the soil to be used by the plant. 
									  watersmart in your soil also ensure an even distribution of water. 
									  every time you water your plants the watersmart will reabsorb water 
									  and store it for later use when the soil is dry. the water crystals watersmart actually 
									  captures and stores the water that would normally just drain water through 
									  the potting soil creating a water reservoir. water crystals for crafts, gardens, cool ties, decor and smelly jelly. water crystals look like real broken ice! discount prices, order water crystals direct from the manufacturer! les cristaux d'eau, wasser kristalle, cristalli d'acqua, água cristais, cristales de agua, water kristallen, veden kiteet, vann krystaller,
