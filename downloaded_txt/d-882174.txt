what is a gift?  

a gift is something we give 
from our hearts.  we may give it to someone we know, a family member, one 
of our children, a co-worker - or we may give it to a total stranger, a beggar 
on the street, a victim of a natural disaster, a refugee from war, an orphaned 
child, or 
a victim of aids.
sometimes we want to give, but we don't know how.  how do 
we give to a homeless person in our home town?   how do we give to an orphan in a foreign 
country?  can we give a personalized gift such as a 
blanket or 
food?  
is giving money to non-profit organizations going to get the needed goods to the 
people in need?  how do we know if an organization is legitimate and will 
truly give our gifts to the needy?  here we offer a way to buy online and ship directly to your chosen charity.  for example, you can order bulk quantities of 
    antibiotics,
    bandages,
    batteries,
    flash drives,

    underwear
    and many 
    other products 
    in large quantities to be shipped to anyplace in the world, often with free shipping! see bulk menu choice on left tree menu for a complete listing.
    
    for individual donors, businesses, foundations or non-profits with limited resources, this may be the most efficient way
    to apply your cash with the most beneficial and accountable outcome. some of the 60+ ways to select a gift include
    baby shower,
    bbq,
    board games,
    chocolates,
    coffee & tea,

        travel guides
travel guides 
        from independent publishers may be more objective than hype directly from venues. many of these independent publishers are presented as ebook authors and different media publishers that can be directly downloaded to your mobile device eliminating any shipping costs. these include the travel authority 
        rick steves, 
        for example, or the renown 
        anthony bourdain,  
        dk eyewitness travel guides,    
        national geographic traveler,  
        insight guides,    
        michelin green,  
        marco polo,   
        bradt guides,     
        berlitz,   
        cultureshock!,

        destinations menu, 
        you will see relevant travel guides by numerous experts in every country, including those by rick steves in european countries like 
        france or 
        spain, for example.
 
        transportation
transportation resources discount deals 
        are important especially for some who prefer one type of transport service over another like 
        airways,
        bus,  
        rail, 
        driving, 
        bicycling,
        limousine,     
        pulling a 
        trailor, or 
        ocean cruising.  
        plan and arrange for 
        car rental and 
        airport parking 
        in advance with great deals from our trusted partners. 
accessories
travel accessories should be planned in advance to avoid getting caught without functional communication devices and essential toiletries, conveniences, comfort items and cameras best suited for the occasion. 
        here we present special selections at best prices! for example, you may need to upgrade your 
        phone with an international sim card and acquire special 
        gps maps, safe 
        wi-fi port (for your tablet or phone), 
        auto accessories, 
        pillows,
        chargers, better 
        camera, 
        image storage,
        batteries and
        selfie sticks or a 
        sports action camcorder-video when you're ready to show off!! 
        and very convenient to tote a  
        tablet to store digital travel guides and language translation guides. 
        most tablets today also include a camera which you can use as a backup for other cameras you may carry, and with wi-fi can serve as an email agent to reduce the costs of international phone charges. some tablets we display also work as mobile phones. whenever flying, make sure your backpacks, bags, bottles, toiletries, gadgets and luggage locks are 
        tsa approved.
        learn how to get 
        tsa pre-approved or prechecked.
            
        how about a special 
        smart watch with an altimeter?  maybe some new 
        luggage is due 
        as well as a 
        toiletries or cosmetics travel kit 
        that complies with safety standards.  a new 
        credit card 
        may give you the flexibility you need for a special trip including additional 
        accessories. 
        destinations
        whether your destinations may include 
        africa, 
        america, 
        asia, 
        south asia, 
        europe or 
        oceania, 
        it's always best to plan as early as possible and learn as much as you can about what to expect and look forward to, including the 
        apparel  
        you need to travel comfortably and in appropriate style for planned activities. 
        languages
language translation for traveling can be facilitated by having a 
        foreign language vocabulary guide in your pocket, 
        bag, cell phone or tablet including specially selected vocabulary guides for popular languages like 
        chinese,
        french,
        german,
        italian, 
        japanese, 
        russian,
        spanish and many more.
        in addition to digital documents for your mobile devices, you can also download translator apps such as 
        google translate or 
        sonico itranslate. some of these mobile apps 
        translate both text and voice for a number of different languages. 
        learning about people you encounter in foreign places is one of the greatest rewards for traveling, and learning the language at least to a conversational level is usually the first step.  
        safety
travel safety planning may include guidance and resources like those we especially selected for your 
        children or 
        pets or for 
        high altitude,
        weather,
        luggage locks, 
        maps,
        etiquette,
        regulations and 
        self-defense.  make sure 
        any self-defense devices you bring with you, if any, are approved by travel regulations and laws of destination states and are safe for traveling. you may also need some advice or assistance in securing your 
        tourist visa or passport for certain countries.
        travel insurance 
        is also a worthy margin when costs are considerable. stuff happens, especially when venturing into new places for the unseasoned traveler.   if you're a little paranoid about traveling, you can 
        learn more about safety and also focus on 
        safe destinations 
        for minimizing known risks in foreign places. the better you plan and prepare, the more you will enjoy and be ready for any unfortunate events that may possibly occur.  see 
        travel 
        menu on left for more travel topics such as agents, currency, photos backup, printer, scanner and more including popular  
        destinations 
        in all corners of the globe.  
        planning tools
planning with a spreadsheet is a good idea such as the templates from microsoft including family_vacation_itinerary.xlsx, 
        vacation_items_checklist.xlsm and vacation_planner.xlsx. click to download these spreadsheets or you can 
        search for more templates using 
        microsoft office excel on your pc.  you may share 
        such documents with friends and family in your travel group to keep everyone in sinc and get mutual support and input.  it's easy to use microsoft one or google drive to allow your group to share these 
        documents. good planning in advance, 
        with reliable intelligence,  
        helps you to worry less and enjoy or accomplish more on your travels!
   
        ok, this is a lot of information to help you plan in advance for a significant journey or vacation, but if you now need to get 
        a good price for traveling from here to there in the near future, get some good prices by keying in your destination on this page
        here. you don't have to sell your soul just to get some 
        prices from our trusted travel partners!
giving while traveling
opportunities to give are plentiful: regardless of your formal plans, you will inevitably encounter opportunities to give 
        to people in need during your travels.  almost anywhere in the world, there are people, often young children, asking for help in the streets.  
        give what you can and be supportive by buying local handcrafts or tipping street entertainers.  if your children are with you, this may 
        be an occasion to teach them the joy of giving and helping others. or go the next step to make giving a part of your plan. plan to give 
        and enjoy the opportunity to make someone smile!  it may be a good idea to keep an extra 
        purse or wallet 
        of small denomination bills or coins as your gift giving wallet.  remember, you don't have to go out of your way to find people in need: they are just 
        about everywhere you may possibly travel. but, if you are interested in visiting an orphanage, for example, most orphanages welcome visitors, especially 
        those bearing gifts.  see the give-to-orphans page for gifts ideas.
