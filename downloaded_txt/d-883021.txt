i’m ani (she/they), also known as “professional audie” on tiktok.



i help neurodivergent senior executives and professionals reduce their stress and free their creativity from the corporate chaos. as a transformation coach, i help neurodivergent people build sustainable professional lives and get back to enjoying their personal lives. i coach neurodivergent leaders to be more strategic, focused and calm, and overcome and avoid burnout.my practical, strengths-based approach comes from my lived experience as an executive director and a late-in-life diagnosis of autism and adhd.get the best from your creative mind and step into your personal and professional goals.








what is life coaching?



coaching is about teaching you the tools you need to build the life you want. it’s different to therapy in that it’s entirely based on your goals.



my clients often know what they want, but they don’t know how to get there, or they feel there’s an obstacle in their way. we’ll work together to get you where you want to be by identifying your strengths and making an achievable plan. i’ll be there to support you along the way and help you stay on track.















who i work with



neurodivergent professionals: ceos, senior executives, and people working in creative agencies and digital teams.leaders with neurodivergent people on their team.people who are navigating a diagnosis of autism, adhd, bipolar, anxiety, depression and more.people who are experiencing burnout and overwhelm.you don’t have to identify as neurodivergent to work with me. i take on clients from all walks of life, but my lived experience of autism and adhd means i’m uniquely qualified to work with people who feel ‘a bit different’.















i can help with



understanding a new diagnosis and building knowledge of how your brain worksbuilding a life that better suits your neurodivergent conditionimproving your leadership style and thriving at workget out of burnout and avoiding it in the futureplanning and achieving your life goals. this could be changing careers, improving your relationships, or starting a businessrebuilding confidencemanaging executive dysfunctionstructuring your time to get the most out of it, leaving room for strategic and creative thinking.
















what my clients say about me















kathryn priestly - founder
i came to coaching with ani after feeling a tension between understanding how my brain needed me to work and think and how i was used to working and thinking. i wasn’t sure what to expect but what i found was not only education about how i could understand what i might need to consider, but also the space to be vulnerable while i learned. ani has a really remarkable way of making you feel like you are in a conversation but actually you are being guided to slow down and connect with your own thoughts, solutions and realisations. she has a wonderful way about her that has helped me find short term solutions when needed as well as find the themes to make longer lasting change. she has made a huge difference for me.











anna - senior strategic designer
when i came to coaching with ani it was mostly out of desperation. nothing else was working. masking my whole life had lead to extreme burn out and a myriad of undiagnosed chronic health conditions. i was putting in a lot of time, effort and $ trying to get better but so much of that was spent explaining things to people who didn’t get it (and didn’t seem to care). i remember coming out of my first session with the relief of finally feeling understood. and with the understanding came strategies and actions, and slowly, almost not noticeably at first the changes started, i felt more confident, masked less, asked for help more (and actually got it), set boundaries, got doctors to listen, slept better, started treatments, had more energy, felt happier and more relaxed. i am very happy with the results i got from coaching and recommend ani very highly. coaching at the start can be a slow burn but if you trust the process the results will speak for themselves.











skye - senior manager
"after years of struggling to recover from a really toxic workplace, your coaching has helped me regain the confidence i once had and made me feel like me again! i think this is because you helped me develop tools and strategies, to overcome the challenges i faced, that are specific to me, my brain, and how it works. it’s not a cookie cutter approach. it’s very personalised. i am stronger, happier and more comfortable in myself than i have been for a long time - and you’ve played a significant role in helping me to get to this point.”











chris - project director
“after suffering most of my adult life, i reached a point in my career where my success was derailed by decision paralysis derived from anxiety. ani was pivotal in helping me overcome this. she understood when to lean in, when to suggest techniques to address recurring patterns and when to just listen, which empowered me to figure it out myself. most importantly, ani spent time to understand how this condition manifested for me as a person, and how to support me in finding the best path forward for my own success.”











zephyr - software developer
“not to be cheesy, but it’s been life-changing! i think about our coaching conversations all the time, and so many of the things i have been struggling with make so much more sense now.” 











kat m - marketing
ani and i have had six sessions together thus far - and i have gotten so much out of it already! i am so excited to be working with her and to have this space to grow but also to be challenged. ani comes to the table organised and open. she lets you take the wheel, set the agenda, make recommendations, and then she’ll keep it on track. gracefully she steers through the necessary neurodivergent bruhaha, shiny big lizards, distractions, tangents, misdirections, avoidances - your usual audhd buffet - to take us to the shallow and deep end of the topics on the table. if she knows it, she’ll say it. if there’s a good book to read, she’ll mention it. the miro board is a beautiful place of topics, tasks, lenses, ideas, agendas - a big developmental playground to grow into who you’d like to be. to where you’d like to go. gentle boundaries but the floor is yours. ani herself is kind but firm. she’s open but direct. she’s mindful of her experience and of not projecting. she cares. a lot. i’m so glad i found her on tiktok and work with her.











lynton - producer
"as i went through ani's coaching program, everything changed for me. initially it was a little at a time, towards the end of our coaching program it accelerated and improved every area of my life, professionally and personally. my engagement with colleagues, managers and clients drastically improved. my ability to think strategically and influence outcomes i previously could not really surprised me. through ani's coaching, the skills i developed are honestly endless but the ones that really stood out were my complex problem solving and emotional regulation.”











katherine - financial advisor
“ani has made an immeasurable difference to how i look at and approach hurdles in both my personal and professional life. she reads and matches my energy, knowing when to challenge and dig deeper and when a discussion is better picked up later or in another form.  with her guidance i’ve been able to relax into finding ways to operate which work for my brain and propel myself forward, rather than continuing to struggle with approaches unsuitable for how i process information and work.  she works in a targeted manner, focused on achieving your goals. diligent and engaged whether solving the world's problems or helping with the baby step needed to make it through a trying week.  i cannot recommend ani highly enough.”











k - lead software engineer
“the hard hitting, thought provoking questions that ani asks makes you think deeper around resolving the root of the problem. the short, concise feedback loops between coaching sessions and applying it to my day to day job are highly beneficial to the outcomes of my work.”











organisational neurodiversity training participant
“it was such an important and relevant topic. i loved  the openness, the information, the statistics, the way it was conveyed. loved every minute and felt overwhelmed with emotions.”
