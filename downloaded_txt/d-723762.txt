        welcome to the montana department of commerce's film office


montana has a long history as a prime location for both large hollywood productions and smaller independent documentaries and films. many renowned actors and filmmakers, such as henry winkler and wim wenders, have fallen in love with everything our state has to offer while on location here.
since its creation in 1974, the montana department of commerce's film office has partnered with filmmakers, television producers, videographers and photographers as a liaison through every phase of their projects. the film office promotes montana as a location for digital and print advertising shoots, films, videos, documentaries and television shows and helps enhance local economies through the many productions that choose locations under the big sky.
whether you’re a filmmaker seeking resources to help you get started, a landowner looking to host productions on your property or a film enthusiast eager to learn about movies shot in our state, you’re in the right place. we offer information on the big sky film grant, a comprehensive list of film summits and educational opportunities, industry reports, regulation and permitting guidelines, and much more. our experienced film office staff looks forward to helping you connect with talent, crews, locations and support services across montana.
