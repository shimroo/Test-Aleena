test the vehicle 



























when buying a vehicle, it is imperative that you test drive it on all types of roads to see how it reacts under acceleration and braking, as well as how it handles at high speeds. listen to the engine, test the steering, shift through the gears and ask as many questions as possible if you hear a suspicious noise. if the seller refuses, don’t buy the vehicle. 











take extra driving hours 



























on the day or the day before the road test, take an hour or two of driving with an instructor: he or she can give you some final recommendations, and maybe give you some tips on the possible routes your inspector might ask you to drive on.
