independence plaza 
lobby and corridor renovation faq
how  is management ensuring all renovation work will be up to code?
  the  project is designed by a licensed architect and will be reviewed and approved  by the nyc department of buildings (dob) before construction begins. once  construction is complete, the architect, engineers, and the dob will inspect  the work to ensure it is within compliance with all codes and regulations. 

will  the renovated lobbies include flood protections? will they be built on higher  ground?  
  the  lobbies will be designed to withstand extreme weather, but will not be raised  because that would create significant accessibility challenges for residents in  wheelchairs and with other mobility constraints. 
  we  know from experience that ip can be vulnerable to flooding in extreme weather  and are coordinating with other stakeholders, including the battery park city  authority and army corps of engineers, to ensure the buildings are protected by  flood mitigation projects in development for lower manhattan. 

will  there be any seating in the renovated lobbies? 
  there  will be limited seating in the lobbies.  

will  the hallway renovations include installing new doors and doorbells?â  
  all  doors will receive a fresh coat of paint and new hardware, including new  doorbells.â  

will  the new carpets be mold-resistant? 
  yes.  the new carpets will be a premium nylon material designed to withstand heavy  foot traffic and prevent mold.

will the paint used be low-odor and zero-voc? 
  yes.  all paint used for the renovations will be master painters institute (mpi)  approved. it will be zero-voc, low-odor, and include a washable finish. 

will  new notice boards be added in hallways?  
  yes.  notice boards will be replaced as part of the corridor renovations. 

will  the doors to stairwells close completely? will there be reflective tape on the  stairs? 
  yes.  all new doors will close properly and there will be reflective tape on the  stairs in line with new york city building codes.

what  precautions will be taken to prevent tampering with mail waiting for pickup in  the temporary mail rooms during renovation? 
  all  temporary and permanent mail rooms will have surveillance cameras to prevent  theft and tampering with mail. 

is there any asbestos present in the areas  that will be renovated? if so, what precautions are being taken to protect  residents from asbestos during the renovations? 
  protecting residents’ safety is our top  priority throughout the renovation. in line with this commitment, we have  conducted exhaustive testing on the lobby and corridors screening for the  presence of asbestos or any other potentially hazardous materials. these tests determined  that there is no asbestos in any of the areas where renovations will be taking  place.

out of an abundance of caution, all work  conducted as part of these renovations and any future projects will adhere to  the latest dob and department of environmental protection (dep) safety rules  and regulations, as well as current industry best practices, regarding asbestos  protection, dust containment, and noise mitigation.

important information for l.a.p. tenants regarding scrie
the following information and program is only applicable to the original ip tenants in the landlord assistant program. it does not affect voucher tenants.)
as you probably know, after months of waiting, governor hochul finally signed the legislative package expanding scrie and drie on december 22, 2022. 
(the bill was passed in state legislation on may 31, 2022, which is therefore considered the official date.) 
this bill originally did not include ipn as a former mitchell lama building. however, thanks to a commitment to us from senator brian kavanagh and assemblymember deborah glick, who helped get this bill through state legislation in the first place, ipn as a former mitchell lama, was also included.  
scrie stands for:
  s ( senior) c (citizen) r (rent) i (increase) e (exemption)
  
  drie stands for
  (disabled) -- the rest is same as above
