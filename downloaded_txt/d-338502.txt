stromung exhaust systems
understeer.com is proud to offer stromung exhaust systems for your bmw.  stromung builds exhaust systems for many bmw models using all stainless steel construction.  the result is a long lasting exhaust that offers increased horsepower, reduced weight and great looks.  because they build their own exhausts in house they can offer more options than many other exhaust companies such as the choice of staggered or equal length tips on their e36 m3 system.  stromung exhausts have a smooth deep exhaust tone that sounds powerful at wide open throttle, yet they don't drone while cruising.  order your stromung exhaust on our on-line store.
