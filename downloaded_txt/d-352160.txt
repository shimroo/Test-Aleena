what's happening




trump's federal freeze
late on monday, january 27th, the trump administration announced that it would halt all federal grants, loans, and other forms of assistance. these funds support local governments, non-profits, and other entities that provide vital services for children, seniors, veterans, and families. this announcement caused widespread confusion and led to multiple chapters at seiu 1199 receiving communication from their employers that their federal accounts were frozen in turn raising serious concerns about their ability to make payroll and continue providing services.
