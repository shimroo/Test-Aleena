the a16 is the ideal flight companion for pilots. this radio practically pays 
for itself by saving pilots both engine hours and fuel during preflight 
communications with the tower. users appreciate the a16's compact, waterproof 
design for one hand operation for working on the flight line, using it for back 
up in any aircraft, or for use by ground crew. its 2400mah li-ion battery lasts 
over 17 hours and the radio includes a nice sit in rapid charger.
in line with the icom brand, the a16 series is designed to operate in the 
harshest of environments. it's compact, boasting a waterproof design (ip67/ip54) 
and built to mil-std-810 (c, d, e, f, g) for the best durability. 
loud audio
air band radios are usually operated in high noise environments, so it is 
essential for the pilotâs radio to provide loud audio. the a16 internal speaker 
delivers a loud 1500mw audio output with clear sound to cut through cabin or 
tarmac noise.
ic-a16 versus icom ic-a14
the ic-a16 is the direct replacement to the very popular icom ic-a14 and 
ic-a14s transceivers.â  the ic-a16 is very similiar in size and design to 
the ic-a14 but introduces a number of enhancements including; ip67 waterproof 
rating, larger capacity battery (2400 mah vs 2000 mah), 8.33khz and 25khz 
channel spacing (versus 25 khz only in the a14), 1500mw loud audio (vs 700 mw on 
ic-a14), and 20% great output power (6 watts versus 5 watts).â  the
icom ic-a16b 
also adds bluetooth which was not available in the ic-a14.
icom ic-a16 features:

full keypad to input the channel or frequency directly
exclusive button for 121.5mhz emergency channel
side tone function to hear your own voice via a third party aviation 
	headset
lcd backlight for night time operation
anl (auto noise limiter) for noise reduction
low battery indication and beep alert
adjustable microphone gain setting
bnc type antenna connector
ip67 waterproof
internal vox capability
weather alert
3 year manufacturer warranty

great upgrade from our old model

by a customer 
												from lincoln ne usa
												on thursday, august 08, 2024

pros: lightweight but sturdy; long battery life & with a faster recharge.

review:
												
really like the lighter weight and the tension in the volume knob; there were times with our old model (the ic-a6) when inadvertent jostling would turn the volume so low i wouldn't hear it.

all you need in a small package.

by tom 
												from norwood,ma
												on sunday, april 16, 2023

pros: battery lasts forever.  i keep light function on while operating without worries.  squelch and volume function easy to find. intuitive to use.  this radio is loud. probably no need for a headset adapter in the cockpit with this one. great receiver.

review:
												
wanted a handheld to pick up atis and potentially departure clearance before start up. also good to have in case of comm failure. it's compact to carry and keep ground control up while working dispatch on the ramp. does what it's supposed to and the size is perfect.  it will be replacing my much loved ic-a23 . the ic-a16 is a noticeably better receiver. able to pick up boston center as well as all corresponding traffic over a large area from my home.
