my passions is all about healthy living – nutritionally and naturally. i’ve researched things like eating right for your blood type – to balancing the ph of your body, to natural remedies for foot fungus – and lots in between. and cooking – i love to create yummy things in the kitchen. i’m always experimenting and finding simple ways to eat healthy and eat well.
having been born an entrepreneur there are many areas i’ve dabbled in – writing books and magazine articles, creating natural products, starting up businesses – lots of fun things. this is a site that is just about my journey through living and learning about life, love, food and how to make it simple.
have a great day and thanks for taking a moment out of your busy day to stop by.
