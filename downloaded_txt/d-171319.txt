the range of data available for a single monthly fee is unbelievable. it works seamlessly with my software and saves me a fortune.
dieter, berlin


using your data i can scan the entire market and quickly find the buying opportunities rather than firing in the dark.

no other data vendor comes close to the amount of information at such a low price.
hamish, edinburgh


having futures, forex, indices, options and equities data all in one place helps me to get a better understanding of the markets.

i used to get my data from a variety of sources and waste hours every week loading it in. eoddata saves me lots of time every month and gives me more data to play with.
