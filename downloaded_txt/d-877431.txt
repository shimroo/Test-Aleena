welcome to the official andrew clements website!
if i were able to come to your town, maybe come visit your school, maybe sit down and share a meal with you in the library or the teacherâs room, iâm sure that weâd have plenty to talk about.
iâd have questions for you, youâd have some for me, and our conversation would go back and forth.  i bet weâd find stuff to laugh about, and maybe some other things that might get a little serious.  because thatâs what itâs like when people get to sit and talk and make new friends.
well, this website feels like a pretty one-sided conversationâwith me doing way too much talking! all i can hope is that you find answers here to some of the questions you may have about my books, my writing, and where all that comes from.
thank you so much for stopping by.
