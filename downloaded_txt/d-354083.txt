	 concert cruises
    


when you go and spend a week on a cruise ship you really want to have a great time, and you will. having great performances and shows is part of the cruise experience.for the kosher traveler you can find today a great new line of jewish music cruises that will provide exactly that. jewish music cruises to fit for the observant crowd accompanied by the top performers in the jewish music industry, with their fantastic new shows. the jewish music variety includes not only the “pop” singers rather also the world of jewish liturgics the chazzanut and performers the chazzanim. on these kosher cruises we build a great selection of artistes so everyone can have something they like. i will not start to name dropping, but you know as well as me that the biggest names in jewish music are on these kosher cruises. the jewish music cruises are at the top standards for kashrut with a team of mashgichim on board and a cruise rabbi to supervise everything and make sure the religious needs are all taken care of.  the food is at five star standards with top glatt kosher cuisine chefs form israeli kosher hotels, using fresh ingredients imported from around the world to assure top ¬quality and great food for every meal.  well if you don’t try it once you will never know how great the jewish music cruises really are.for more about the kosher cruises http://www.jewishmusiccruises.com

	 kosher tours are fit for you
    


 where ever you look it seems like kosher travel is taking over the world, new locations new attractions and it sounds like lots of fun. let’s let the truth be told it is hard to run a kosher tour, the locations are getting easier for the single traveler to find a great kosher tour to the location of his choice.  so what is so great about kosher tours with an organized group tour?  the answer to this in three things kashrut, locations and great groups.  traveling kosher with a group is often the way to go, all kosher meals are setup in advanced and you have no worrying about vegetarian food or eating out of a can for the whole trip.  the kosher meals are supervised by a team of rabbi’s and mashgichim that do their best to offer great kosher food. in the past many kosher travel agencies would offer one or two locations for group kosher tours per season, today we can offer you over 15 locations worldwide. you can join the group form anywhere in the world. all you need to do is choice the location and date you would like to travel and see what we can offer.  for each kosher tour a group is put together in a way to ensure a great tour to all. whether it is the ages and the language spoken by the group all is taken in to consideration.  the pricing you can see for yourself at http://www.exoticjewishtravel.com

	 passover in israel
    


an interesting phenomenon has developed over the last 5 years. for passover, the "dead sea" has become the "miami beach" of israel. all the "anglos" and families that come from abroad, do a minimal cleaning of the house, then they lock their doors, pack up the car, and drive off to the fancy 5-star hotels of the dead sea. and there they spend a week doing the same activities their counter parts are doing in miami - indulging in 3 gourmet meals a day, swimming in the pool, treatments at the spa, oh and of coarse, going to shiurim. the dead sea has become "the place" to be for angols over pesach.i also heard of another "in place" for anglos to be for passover in israel. for 18 years eddie freudmann has been running the passover vacation at the 5 star sheraton moriah plaza hotel in tiberias. many anglo families people have made this their pesach home and have come back year after year.
