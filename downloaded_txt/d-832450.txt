peter l. hawley of new hartford, ct died on “kilobyte day,” october
        24, 2024. even though he loved and understood how digital machines work,
        peter would have cared little that his earthly life ended on 1024. he
        was practical and not sentimental. peter cared deeply about others and
        lived for three things: to race, to ski, and most of all, to be helpful
        to others.
        the meetings of the hartford track club, of which he was president for
        over 20 years, and of the hartford marathon foundation will be a little
        shorter, without peter to remember the nuances of the myriad details
        of conducting a road race.
        peter served on the ski patrol of ski butternut for 44 years following
        college and three years in the u.s. army signal corps. since 1990, peter
        had been a first aid and outdoor emergency care instructor. in 2014,
        he achieved a national ski patrol appointment. his patrol director said
        peter was the first to report to work, every day that he was on duty
        with the patrol.
        peter began running at age 35, briefly following in the footsteps of
        his brother tim and then soundly beating him for 37 years. many are the
        runners who were out-kicked to the sound of peter’s size 12 brooks
        beasts coming out of nowhere. peter completed 49 marathons including
        several bostons and every hartford marathon from the inaugural race in
        1996 through 2022. he always helped set up the course, too. he “did” the
        mt. washington road race three times and ran probably more than a thousand
        other races.
        we are thankful that he was not hit by a car while training for a marathon
        before dawn or when crossing the founder’s bridge on his bicycle
        to certify the hartford marathon course. and that he fully recovered
        from the mild stroke he had a few years ago. we are thankful for the
        many years he was a friend, co-worker, mentor, and brother.
        peter graduated from housatonic valley regional h.s. in 1967. he became
        an fcc-licensed radio technician, then served in the u.s. army signal
        corps (graduating first in his class at signal school), and graduated
        from wabash college in indiana. together with his father and brother,
        peter built a house where he lived for 35 years.
        at al’s seafood, he applied his listening and computer skills to
        improve processes. as an astute ibm as400 tech with business knowledge,
        peter found a role at hartford technologies and worked there until he
        retired in 2019. peter volunteered to help cfpa maintain ct blue trails.
        peter was the eldest son of kathleen lamphier hawley and samuel seymour
        hawley. he was predeceased by his parents, brother john, and sister karen.
        he is survived by his brother tim, nephews sam and john, niece kirsten,
        and many friends in the butternut ski patrol, hartford track club, and
        hartford marathon foundation.
        a memorial service will be held on saturday november 16 at 11 a.m., rocky
        hill congregational church, 805 old main st., rocky hill, ct. reception
        at the church to follow. remote access at https://bit.ly/4fcje43. in
        lieu of flowers, contributions to the great mountain forest foundation
        in norfolk, ct or volunteering to help the hartford track club conduct
        a race would be welcomed.
