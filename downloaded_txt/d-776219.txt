day 40





yesterday i visited a nursing home and talked to some lovely residents.
we have so much to learn from our elders.
one man had been married for 62 years.. i asked him how you do it. how do you make it work.
he paused thoughtfully..
he said

"always be the first to say your sorry"

day 36





when you find yourselves a little gloomy, look around you and find somebody in a worse plight than yourself;
go to him and find out what the trouble is, then try to remove it with the wisdom which the lord bestows upon you; and the first thing you know, your gloom is gone, you feel light, the spirit of the lord is upon you, and everything seems illuminated.

day 35





true happiness comes only by making others happy-
the practical application of the savior's doctrine of loosing one's life to gain it.
in short, the christmas spirit is the christ spirit, that makes our hearts glow in brotherly love and friendship ad prompts us to kind deeds of service.

of course there is no going back, but only forward. rather than dwelling on the past, we should make the most of today, of the here and now, doing all we can to provide pleasant memories for the future

after suitable rest and relaxation, there is not a day, hour or minute that we should spend in idleness, but every minute of every day of our lives we should strive to improve our minds and increase our faith in the holy gospel
