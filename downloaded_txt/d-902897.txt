						case study: how one ibm i shop is resolving tech debt with education and code-conversion software

					04 february 2025          






technical debt can be daunting, especially when it involves updating old code or migrating to a new environment.
by jim buck
many ibm i shops face significant challenges in addressing technical debt that stifles innovation and modernization. however, the path to resolving these issues may be more straightforward than it seems.

comparing two ifs objects just became much simpler with the new compare_ifs service.
by sarah mackenzie
the compare_ifs table function allows you to compare two ifs objects and determine if the objects being compared have different attributes. you can also compare the contents of two different directories and determine whether there are objects that exist in one directory and not the other and whether those objects in the directory and its subdirectories have different attributes.

						should i care about cves on ibm i?

pauline brazil ayala 



					21 january 2025          






the days when we could feel confident that ibm i had no security vulnerabilities are very much over. a peek at the common vulnerabilities and exposures (cve) registry list proves it.
by pauline brazil ayala
for security admins on windows and linux platforms, the common vulnerabilities and exposures (cve) registry has been common knowledge for a long time. but to ibm i admins, it may be a little less well known. when i worked in a multi-platform security team, we bragged that there were never any ibm i security vulnerabilities. windows and linux were riddled with them, but ibm i? nope, never. we held our heads high with pride. however, in recent years, a few things have changed in the ibm i cve landscape. one is that the platform has been getting more attention from folks trying to penetrate the system, whether they be bad actors or penetration testers. another is that a lot of open-source, third-party software has been introduced to the system, allowing for innovation. this article aims to shed a little light on what cves are and how they can be used to your security advantage.
