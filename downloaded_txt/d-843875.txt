welcome to christ church!















christ church is a welcoming, joy-filled, intergenerational community, where worship is at the center of everything we do.christ church was founded in 1733 as the first house of worship in the colony of georgia. maintaining the spirit of our earliest days, we seek to be a house of prayer where all are welcome. at christ church, you will meet people of all ages, stages, and backgrounds, and together, we seek to embody the love, joy and hospitality that christ extends unconditionally to all. our worship is filled with wonder and joy, rooted in tradition yet open to what is new. join us on sunday at 10:30 a.m. as we grow in deeper connection with god and one another.





“walk in love, as christ loved us and gave himself for us, an offering and sacrifice to god.”

— ephesians 5:2
