with just a few days left before our anniversary, i finally managed to get our announcement in the toledo blade!  we felt like one year was the acceptable time limit to make such announcements, and are glad we made it in!see the online post here:brian and mimi treasealso, if you're reading this and never received our thank you card from our wedding, please know that we're still working on them!!  it's been a busy year finishing up school in ann arbor, but we will still get all of them sent out!allright, almost at the one-year mark now --- i think we just might make it!brian

	 some photos on flickr
	 
    

hi again,here are the first batch of our photographer's photos that i've posted to flickr...(these are the same as the previous posting, but just on a more accessible site.)http://www.flickr.com/photos/briantrease/sets/72157594218941468/you can add comments, tags, etc., and you can also order prints.  i'll get the rest up soon, and when i'm all done, i'll probably still post them to snapfish, since i believe it might be easier to order prints there.enjoy!

	 1,000 good things come to those who wait
	 
    

1,042, more precisely, photos posted online, that is.yes, our photographer got back to us with our proofs last week, which you can for the time view at his website: http://trease.weddingherald.com/ [update:  this website is now gone.  refer to our more recent posts for links to our photos.]you can buy photos from the site if you want, but they're rather expensive. however, we were given access to all the original digital files ourselves (on cd.rom), which i'll be posting to my flickr account soon (maybe snapfish, too). from those sites, you'll be able to download photos, add witty comments, mark favorites, and order prints.also, note that this is only half of our photos! we still have the 900+ that all of you took, that i'm still figuring out when and how to put online. patience! they'll be worth it!cool beans!brian

since it's taking a while to sort and prepare all the photos we've received so far (over 900), i'm sharing this one now, just because i love it.   make sure to view it large.  enjoy!

	 mysterious pillows (oh, so alluring)
	 
    

mimi and i received some great pillows from our bb&b registry ... big, white, fluffy clouds of luxurious comfort.  and as much as we'd like to thank the generous gifter, we cannot find a name, tag, or gift card anywhere on the pillow or in the bag!so, here's your lucky and last chance to take credit for yourselves.  or, if you're feeling devious, you can try to take credit for someone else's gift!  or, perhaps you just feel embarrased about purchasing bedroom paraphenalia and wish to remain discretely anonymous ... but really, we're married now, so speak up -- it's all ok!indulgence™ side sleeper queen pillow
