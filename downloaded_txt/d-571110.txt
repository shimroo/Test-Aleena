i cannot imagine not seeing this wonderful family every year. camp has gotten me through some of the worst and has celebrated some of my best times. 
kim s. (she/they), fowlerville, mi



i loved having an immediate and deep connection to all campers, and the sense of family that was ever-present. i’ve never felt so self-confident in my entire life, because the openness of the campers was so absolute. 
kevin j. (he/him), louisville, ky



this is the most incredible creation of community and culture i believe exists on this planet, and that’s not just for queer people.  i can’t imagine cultivating this type of non-judgmental, loving and edifying space anywhere else.
chris d. (he/him), arlington, ma



the people and the activities were the best. everyone was so friendly and open. i just met some amazing people…
