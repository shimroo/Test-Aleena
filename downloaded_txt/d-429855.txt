research & rescue on ocean sunfish
our amazing team mola has interacted with almost 90 ocean sunfish in the 2021/2022 season!
from the smallest we have worked with to the absolute largest, we are had an eventful season. learn more about our efforts on our ocean sunfish page. 
 








the southcoast terrapin project, 2021
where necwa  sees a need, where we see a difficult interaction between the community and the native wildlife, we step in. the southcoast terrapin project stepped into two new areas this year.
the major project that came out of this season was the besse park turtle bucket pilot project. plus we have expanded our research areas to new neighborhoods. you can read all about it on our southcoast terrapin project page.
                         









marine education presentations
we have a life sized inflatable humpback whale!!!
necwa strongly believes that educational outreach is an important piece of species conservation and management. necwa provides meaningful and engaging educational programs for schools, organizations, and the public in an effort to help people better understand and connect to the unique marine wildlife that lives off the coast of new england. we customize our programs to create engaging classroom and community events for learners and nature enthusiasts of all ages. whenever possible, we incorporate our research findings into our programs to support the learning experience. to learn more, visit our marine education presentations page.
