uk long range weather forecast


sunday 23 feb -
tuesday 4 mar




the start of this period will be unsettled, with heavy rain and strong winds affecting all parts as a deep area of low pressure crosses just to the north of the uk. gales or severe gales are likely around coasts, especially in the north and west. it will be very mild though. next week and into early march is uncertain. it is possible that further spells of mild, wet and windy weather affect the uk, interspersed with cooler, showery conditions, but there is also a chance that drier, more settled conditions develop, especially towards the south of the uk. temperatures are likely to be close to or a little above average overall, although should drier, more settled conditions develop, then nights may become colder with a risk of frost.
updated: 14:00 (utc) on tue 18 feb 2025



wednesday 5 mar -
wednesday 19 mar




much of this period looks like being mainly unsettled, with atlantic frontal systems spreading across the uk from the west. these will bring spells of rain and strong winds at times, interspersed with some drier, brighter periods. however, the start of the period may be drier and more settled, especially towards the south. it may become a little drier and more settled towards the south or southeast around the middle of the month too, with the wettest and windiest weather possibly becoming more confined towards the northwest. temperatures are likely to be a little above average overall, although cooler spells are likely in between frontal systems, and overnight frost is possible under clearer skies.
