i sit by the pond created by the streams of my tears and dream,
 dream of a tomorrow that won’t ever be
a tomorrow where you would still be;
 whole
a tomorrow where i could feel you and hear you

but regardless of how i try to create the 
reality
 the truth always emerges and brings it 
 crashing down 
the dreams of techno-color get cast to greyscale
 every pixel of my dream distorts, falls, and shatters on the ground

acceptance is the only way now
 but shying away is so much easier
so for now i’ll enjoy the moments of my 
 falsified reality and sit with you again

until the window is cracked and the outside comes flooding in
 i’ll never not choose a reality that has you
just wait for me to cast a dreamscape again.
 we will be returned to a reality with us


about this poem
i lost my father recently and during a major grief stricken moment i just reached for my phone and started typing then there was this. i would do anything to be able to see him again. it’s very hard to accept and i want my life back with him in it.
