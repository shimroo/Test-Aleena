				introducing our new line of professional tactical leashes!

				the tactical leashes are a strong, lighter weight line of 
				professional products with four rows of rubberized stitching on 
				both sides of the webbing. the rubber is set lower into the 
				fabric, so it allows the leash to glide easily through the 
				handler’s hands, yet the rubber allows the handler to stop the 
				slide any moment.

				the tactical leashes are available in two colors, international 
				search and rescue orange and camouflage green. tactical leashes 
				are 3/4" wide and come in 5 lengths ranging from 4 feet to 30 
				feet long and in the versatile, variable length police lead.
