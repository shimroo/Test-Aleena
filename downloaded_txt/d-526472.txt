          💡 have you considered becoming a cmmc certified professional (ccp)? 
👉  the requirements can be difficult to navigate, and don't always provide future ccps with a clear picture of exactly what is required to become certified 
👉  hopefully this can help someone interested in pursuing the ccp better understand the costs associated with this pursuit
❓ if you have questions about whether becoming a ccp is the right path for you, or if it would provide value to you or your organization, please reach out

(2) affirmation content. each cmmc affirmation shall include the following information: (i) name, title, and contact information for the affirming official; and (ii) affirmation statement attesting that the osa has implemented and will maintain implementation of all applicable cmmc security requirements to their cmmc status for all information systems within the relevant cmmc assessment scope."

          psa: security tools don't need their own cmmc certification, but a fully managed service that includes ongoing support and active administration (people performing processes using the tool) does require cmmc certification.

whether you're an internal it team member or an external service provider, your security tool vendors cannot fully absorb your cmmc burden.

          as tens of thousands of defense contractors become more aware of cmmc, msps everywhere are waking up to their own certification requirements. 

join me at it nation secure 2024 for some specific examples of how cmmc is going to impact msps, and why certification for an msp will be different from your clients' assessments.

          3 things have been true since cmmc 2.0 was announced in november 2021

1) cmmc is happening
2) dod will offer cybersecurity tools and services
3) there is a huge gap between cmmc requirements and dod's solutions

it started with the dod cio's town hall in february 2022 and has persisted in various panels, presentations, and testimonies since then.

now, years after cmmc became an inevitability, those offerings are formalized in appendix iii of dod's recent dib cyber strategy:

- network traffic monitoring x2
- threat detection and blocking x2
- vulnerability scanning x2
- cybersecurity program evaluation
- network mapping
- phishing assessments
- asset discovery
- training through project spectrum and blue cyber

yet the gap between the offerings and the requirements verified by cmmc remains and i see no possible way that changes between now and roll-out of cmmc (which could start as early as the end of this year).

the bottom line: hoping that dod will suddenly change course to match tools and services to the requirements imposed on the dib is not a strategy.

contractors and subs should plan accordingly.

          for those out there who are grc practitioners, if you don't follow jacob horne, you should. 

in this post he speaks to three things that we all need to know:

1. cmmc is a thing, it will be imposed on the defense industrial base soon...
2. dod and other government agencies offer services that can help bridge part of the gap between cmmc and where a company in the dib is in the cmmc journey.
3. the gap that is left is not trivial. don't wait... get to work now... you are already late.

          the department of defense (dod) recently published a proposed rule amending the defense federal acquisition regulation supplement (dfars) to incorporate contractual requirements pertaining to the proposed cybersecurity maturity model certification (cmmc) 2.0 program. the new proposed rule is a significant development in the path toward finalizing the cmmc 2.0 program. based on its current trajectory, the likelihood of a finalized cmmc 2.0 going into effect in 2025 is quite high.

beth burgin waller and patrick austin, members of the woods rogers cybersecurity & data privacy practice group, provide an overview of the key provisions contained in the proposed dfars rule. #woodsrogers #cybersecurity #dod

          dod platform one
        






 

              
          platform one is not just about the work that we do but the work that we make capable. 🤝 

vulcan’s team of only 6 people had to create a “pay by the seat” licensing model to help dod customers adopt #devsecops and agile practices as a part of the cloud-centric vision within disa j9 hosting and compute (j9 hac).

by utilizing platform one’s big bang and iron bank the vulcan team was able to create a low cost – best value solution for dod customers who wanted an enterprise solution without feeling the major budget constraints that can impact the ability to deploy and get tools to the warfighters. 🎖 

platform one can be effectively utilized by a team of just 6 people, imagine what we could do for you! click here to contact our customer success team to do a tech fit today:

          i received an e-mail today from nsa about their tools for the dib entitled "free cybersecurity services from dod for defense industrial base". don't get me wrong, i am happy they are providing the tools to the dib but it seems like the nsa tools and the project spectrum cloud tools they are working on for the dib are too exclusionary. we have a lot of small businesses that are trying to get into being part of the dib "club" and are expected to meet all the requirements that are being given out for free to companies with dod contracts. 

does this mean that if you don't have an existing contract you will not be able to afford to participate to get a contract? the companies that already have contracts have already agreed to dfars 7012 flowdowns. the new companies are just trying to get kickstarted and the free tools are not being provided?

please, let's talk about how we can get the new companies to be part of the dib and use the tools provided.

          beyond excited to announce the launch of the platform one solutions marketplace! huge shout out to the team and everyone who worked on this incredible leap forward in government acquisitions. some of the many highlights:
1. continuously open solicitation - industry can submit devsecops solutions and be evaluated continuously, unlimited proposal submissions and evals every 30 days. 
2. a digital, web based medium for dod users to conduct market research with vendors in a post competition environment and immediately negotiate and award a variety of contracts and agreements. 
3. a major focus on non-traditionals, startups, small business, commercial products and services, due to a very low barrier to entry and continuous feedback loops.
4. the p1sm is completely decentralized, allowing all other dod users to use the marketplace without paying a fee or ordering authority training by meeting all the competition requirements for ota's (10 usc 4021 and 4022), cso's (dfars 212.70) and baa's (far/dfar part 35).
