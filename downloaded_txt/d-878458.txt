what our customers are saying






testimonials





















“i encourage anyone to wade into the waters of shopping here on a regular basis for your health, not just in your body, but also in building a thriving and sustainable community. besides the locally grown foods and all the pieces/parts of the animals that you can't find at other stores, the most valuable and rare thing is simply a smile and a hello how are you today.”— lisa arceneaux






















“you play a critical role in the local food system, and this is very important to me. if we all supported local farmers, ate locally and seasonally, and used incredible resources like laughing buddha, the world would be a better and healthier place.”— andy chrestman






















“it is very important to me to get local produce, meat and other goods. proper treatment of food animals is extremely important! the employees are extremely kind and knowledgeable about the products. you will not be disappointed with the products or experience at laughing buddha!”— andrea l. mertz






















“it makes grocery shopping so simple. we needed sources of food that were clean. and we wanted to put our money in support of our values: local economies, regenerative farming, soil health. make the whole experience of shopping for your food a connected one by knowing the people that grow your food, the ones that raise the animals you eat, package it and sell it.”— lauren sanders






















“i love that you have brought so many different farmers and growers and makers together. it makes a better community when you know where your food comes from and the care that went into growing, raising, harvesting and selling those to the community. you won't find fresher, tastier produce anywhere.”— leah mathis






















“it's a pleasure to come to the store every week for my groceries. the produce, eggs, meat and dairy products are just the best. you really can taste the difference! besides the spectacular quality of the products, kate and her team are stellar human beings and it's a joy to patronize their business!”— angela m. rinehart






















“we fell in love with the quality of products and as we got to know everyone, the added bonus of supporting local was the mega prize. i let friends and coworkers know about the unbelievable convenience and quality of laughing buddha all the time.”— jacinta gisclair






















“having a wide range of products under one roof is what sets laughing buddha apart. you will always be satisfied with your products and the people who care for those products. the community of laughing buddha makes the shopping experience more rewarding and inclusive.”- mary mcdade casteel & trenton mynatt
