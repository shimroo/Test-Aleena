about ellen hart sturm
it’s hard to imagine a life more quintessentially new york than ellen hart- sturm’s. while still a student at jamaica high school in queens, she was selected to be miss subways in the spring of 1959. the promotion, which served as the inspiration for miss turnstile in the classic nyc musical on the town, placed her picture on subway trains around the city and opened the doors for a singing, acting, and modeling career.
