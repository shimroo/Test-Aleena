your biggest problem solved





youth ministers and faith educators agree:
“our teens believe what they hear from the media more than what they hear in church.”
in hollywood vs. faith, frank is able to open eyes in a way few youth speakers can.
credible and tremendously entertaining
hollywood vs. faith is also great combined with sermon on the mount as a special event for the whole family. it’s eye-opening and fun for all ages.
ideal for faith formation, confirmation retreats and youth events.
