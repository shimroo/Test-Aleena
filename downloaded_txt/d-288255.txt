noah movie review by jim pinkoski who was a friend 
of ron's

________________________________________________

reasons to believe ron wyatt did find the ark of the 
covenant

_________________________________________________

the israel antiquities authority confirms that ron wyatt found
chambers during his excavation in the garden tomb grounds.

_________________________________________________

henry gruver saw the lab report on jesus' blood,
and a professional document analyst verified its
authenticity.

______________________________________________

the garden tomb society prints a book with quotes from
general gordon who discovered skull hill or golgotha in 1880,
which quotes him as saying the ark of the covenant was hidden there.

above:  example of ron wyatt's kindness and sincerity


the forces of 
darkness are threatened by these discoveries


and are 
influencing men to reject what god has done.


how many people, leaders, 
accepted jesus in his day?


we cannot expect this 
dark world to 
embrace god's material.


 



comment about the baseless critics:
"i studied both of the [negative] 
        sites you sent me regarding ron wyatt and his findings. several things 
        bother me: first, it was difficult for me to parse the criticisms of the 
        actual archaeology as opposed to criticisms of the person and/or his 
        associates. the words shyster and fraud appear numerous times. yet at 
        the same time i sense a kind of intellectual snobbery oozing from the 
        pages. it seems evident that criticism regarding official credentials 
        takes precedence over the substance of any actual discoveries. i find it 
        curiously bothersome that neither site gives ron any credit for anything 
        positive whatsoever. that indicates to me that an ulterior agenda is at 
        work. something which ron represents is apparently offensive, therefore 
        the baby must be thrown out with the bathwater. they appear to have the 
        attitude that he is a boil on the butt of legitimate archaeology. 
        further, broad sweeping generalizations are made about non-credentialed 
        diggers.  i think that is irresponsible ad hominem and snobbery.
        

        "the pictures of sodom and gomorrah, mount sinai and underwater wheels 
        and axels are by themselves an amazing revelation to me. rons 
        explanation of the details using numerous biblical references also 
        impressed me as probably accurate. i find it particularly disturbing 
        that the aig site failed to comment with any substance on these things. 
        instead, extensive efforts seemed directed at discrediting the so-called 
        noahs ark find and thereby discrediting ron personally as well as 
        anything else he may have found. 

        "finally, i find it extremely curious that the tentmaker site would 
        comment with such distain on rons claims to have found blood cells 
        which contained only 24 chromosomes. thats impossible, says the 
        author. really? just stop and thinka virgin birth is also impossible, 
        resurrection is impossible, as are numerous other occurrences given in 
        the bible. maybe that is the point! to me, the author ends up sounding 
        like a pagan non-believer, even an atheist. 

        "its curious that jesus picked a bunch of un-credentialed uneducated 
        men belonging to the lower class working stiffs (fishermen) to spread 
        the word about a radically different revelation of god. im sure the 
        elitist pharisees and sadducees had no end of ridicule for them. i also 
        find it instructive to recall numerous examples in scripture where god 
        arranged circumstances where part of an audience saw or heard something 
        significant while others saw or heard nothing unusual. the account of 
        saul/paul being struck down on the road to damascus is just one example. 
        he heard the voice of christ and perhaps a few others did also, yet 
        other people heard something else, perhaps something easily explained as 
        natural (acts 22:9). 

        "i have no reason to defend or support the personage or heritage of ron 
        wyatt. my interest is in the findings, not the person. when i see the 
        kind of unbalanced criticisms referenced, it leads me to wonder what is 
        really going on behind the scenes. my suspicion is that ron was a very 
        devoted believer who made several important discoveries supporting 
        biblical history.  mental illness?--i got no flavor of that on the 
        4 hour twenty minute dvd, but that does not completely rule it out of 
        course. i do not think it serves the christian community well for 
        members to be so publicly maligning of rons motives, character and 
        mental health. what may appear to some as fraud, deceit, delusions or 
        even hallucinations may not in fact be that at all. the apparent rancor 
        seems to me more consistent with fragile egos and prideful traditions 
        vying for recognition rather than diligent consideration using christian 
        principles of charity, etc."          
        dale
 



 






 michael rood 22 min. video endorsing ron wyatt
michael rood on ron wyatt from  vimeo.

 








the critics
the critics have attacked the discoveries and/or ron 
        wyatt for various reasons.  some do not have the faith to believe 
        that god can perform miracles in these last days.  others do not 
        believe that ron wyatt is telling the truth, (although we do not rely on 
        his word alone because we have seen the evidence for ourselves, except 
        the ark of the covenant.)  other 
        critics are inwardly jealous that one man could find all these 
        discoveries, but they are not considering that god was the source behind 
        the work.  but can we expect the world to 
        believe what god is doing to prepare a show-and-tell demonstration for 
        mankind at the end of time?  satan is at work to counteract that 
        which god is doing, but we know god's purpose will be done in spite of 
        what the arch-deceiver is doing.  friend, please look at the 
        evidence and do not listen to the untruths that have been passed along 
        in an un-christian manner over the internet which are designed to attack 
        god's work.  
        the evidence is real and will allow one to decide for themselves if the discoveries are 
        from god or satan.  we don't have to wait for a scientific 
        community to tell us what is genuine, as they did not believe in the ark 
        before the flood, and they still do not believe in it today.







"do not believe any of these discoveries, they are nothing but lies!" 


satan

it is amazing that some christians are on the 
side of atheists,
attacking this wonderful material.  darkness wins.



 






      hello friends:  
  here near the end of time god
is providing evidence to validate the authenticity of the bible.  most of the world today does
not believe in the bible or jesus.  before jesus returns to take his
faithful home with him, everyone on earth will take a stand for or against him 
  in the way they worship. 
  these biblical, archaeological evidences of god's love and truth will play a major role in
displaying for the last time, god's true form of worship.  the mark of the
beast will be presented, a false form and a true form of worship will be placed
before mankind, and only those who follow jesus and his
commandments will be saved.
