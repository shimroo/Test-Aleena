about

			gpi (formerly gameprogita) was a rather active community of italian game developers.
			currently, this page has the following objectives:
			to provide the list and map of italian video game development companies;
to provide pointers to the most active communities of italian developers on the web.

			if you have a video game company and you want it to be included in this list,
			feel free to contact me (davide.barbieri at ghostshark.it).
			
			i'm currently accepting any registered video games development company:
			which is officially registered on italian soil and pays taxes in italy;
which released or is currently developing a videogame for the consumer market;
has its own logo and website.
