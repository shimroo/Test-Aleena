utah assistive technology program
independence is priceless. we make it possible.






mission
the utah assistive technology program (uatp) is part of the institute for disability research, policy and practice at utah state university. our mission is to put assistive technology into the hands of people who need it. we also help people afford those devices. our goal is to promote independence in education, employment, and community settings.




we serve individuals with disabilities of all ages throughout the state of utah. our job is to provide assistive technology devices and services, as well as train parents, children with disabilities, professional service providers, and university students about assistive technology. we coordinate our services with community organizations and others who provide independence-related supports.
uatp will accept consumers within the state of utah. 



what is assistive technology?
assistive technology is any item, piece of equipment, or system that can increase, maintain or improve independence. it can be high- or low-tech.
