five sizes to choose from







gives you the proper fit



the free flight's mechanism and glove design gives you 15 lbs. less felt draw weight. add another 15 lbs. for arrow speed or keep your present weight for an easier draw. with the mechanism held in tight for a longer draw length, add even more fps.

a smooth crisp trigger
a size made to fit your hand
the mechanism on a form fitted platform that forces consistency

imagine doing a one handed pull-up with a rope tied to your wrist watch. now imagine the wrist watch and the rope going back into the exact same position for the next one. the free flight's glove forms to your hand, with every radius becoming a contact for support. this support is reinforced by the grip you naturally have when making a fist. all of these features give you the most important part of a draw -- confidence in everything that follows.

gives much needed confidence to the young and junior shooters
confidence and more fps for the women shooters
gives the men a reason to forget about target panic

american made quality that will last season after season.
