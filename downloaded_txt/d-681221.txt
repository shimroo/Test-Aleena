bowling for soupswing life away - rise againstgirl - becksunrise - nora jonescrazy - alana davisi have no clue how to tag, or even who else to tag, so too bad!comments: leave a comment   current music:iron chef on tvsecurity:subject:ain't work fun?time:09:27 pmcurrent mood:sleepyi have become addicted to starbucks frappuccinos. i have also decided that my life mimics office space (i read a post by someone that said this too, but mine really does):typical day in my life - 7:15am - drive to work, late as usual, crawl through stop lights and listen to music way too loud to get my eyes to open up.8:15am - pull into parking garage, and have to park on like the 8th floor cuz i'm late.8:30am - get to desk, check e-mail.8:40am - read headlines on google news.9:02am - go get coffee downstairs at the coffee shop (not starbucks). talk to the girls down there (jennifer and molly and amanda, they're nice and they always remember my drink, grande nonfat chai)9:30am - back at desk, check e-mail. 10:00am - start making lunch plans.11:00am - go to lunch somewhere downtown, taking time to enjoy the walk and people watch.12:15pm - get back from lunch, check e-mail.12:30pm - maybe do some work, but most likely, take a walk around the floor to say hi to people.2:00pm - starbucks run. it's a few blocks away, so take time walking and enjoying the fresh air.2:30pm - get back from starbucks, check e-mail.3:00pm - maybe do some work, most likely surf and enjoy the frapuccino. 4:00pm - start packing up, maybe schedule some meetings for myself for tomorrow so that i look booked up so people don't schedule meetings with me.4:45pm - leave work to hopefully beat traffic.yup, and tomorrow's friday, which means that lunch will be longer (maybe 1.5-2 hours), and leave earlier (probably 4ish).comments: leave a comment  august 9th, 2005 security:subject:death suckstime:07:00 pmcurrent mood:sadtoday i found out that someone i used to work with died in a car accident late sunday night. how sucky is that to start your day off. i was waiting for someone else to die, i know it sounds bad, but it always happens in threes, and tim's dad died, then my great aunt helen died, so i knew another was coming. but it's not easy. today's just been kind of blah, not really sure what i did today, but i'm sure it was something. i stayed at work, cause what else was i gonna do, sit at home and mope? but just kind of blah this evening. just sucks.comments: 3 comments or leave a comment  august 1st, 2005 current music:9news theme songsecurity:subject:freaking outtime:10:25 amcurrent mood:scaredhttp://www.9news.com/acm_news.aspx?osgname=kusa&ikobjectid=73fb6f12-0abe-421a-0174-4145e0a06ecf&templateid=0c76dce6-ac1f-02d8-0047-c589c01ca7bfyeah. in my 'hood. yeah. freaking out.comments: 4 comments or leave a comment  july 18th, 2005 current music:white noise of the office - haven't dug out the ipod yetsecurity:subject:movies movies moviestime:09:36 amcurrent mood:monday's suckwatched a few strange movies the past few times, i guess going into hollywood video and trying to find good, interesting movies has become harder and harder. but, after passing over donnie darko so many times and then finding out what an amazing movie it is, we're trying to look for those innocuous movies that are truly cool.we watched code 46 last night, tim robbins movie, totally strange. was a good movie though, one of those where you go "hrm" at the end. also watched kinsey, which was also good. i soooo want to go see wedding crashers and charlie and the chocolate factory... maybe this weekend.comments: leave a comment
