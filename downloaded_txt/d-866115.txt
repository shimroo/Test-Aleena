   wildfires and disasters 


 we're tasked by the state with responding to wildfires. we study weather patterns, drought cycles and the status of vegetation across the state to predict when and where dangerous fire conditions may occur. should a wildfire ignite, we maintain a statewide network of strategically-placed teams of firefighters and equipment so that we're able to respond quickly when the call comes.

   preparing for wildfires


rural fire departments respond to 80 percent of wildfires in texas - and they do it with shoestring budgets and almost entirely with volunteers. we help fire departments pay for needed training and equipment and help texans learn how to prevent, prepare for and protect against wildfire.
