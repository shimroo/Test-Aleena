welcome to my dax
    rush
    web page!




 

sold!

 

with great sadness i have sold my beloved and well-known dax rush.
 thanks to everyone who expressed an
interest in buying jadzia.



 
this is the ongoing story of the build-up and use of
my dax rush v8 kit car.
the story began at the very end of 1998, when i
decided to build a kitcar. i started the build in march 1999 and drove the completed rush
round the donington park race track at the kitcar show there on september 18th 1999,
coincidentally my birthday!

the latest news.
this web site
i searched the web for anyone else's dax rush build page, but
couldn't find any. the obvious thing to do was to start my own, dedicated to my rush. so
here it is, the first on the web, as far as i know.
