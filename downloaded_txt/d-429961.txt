						“for a business owner, securing a home mortgage is more challenging and time consuming because it is more difficult to verify income. many mortgage brokers don't even want to put in the effort. that was not the case with oakstreet mortgage. rob m. worked diligently to get me a good deal. there were some complications, but rob never complained. he probably had to work 5 times as many hours on my mortgage than he would on a standard one. communication was great throughout the process, and the end result was what i wanted. i highly recommend this company.”
