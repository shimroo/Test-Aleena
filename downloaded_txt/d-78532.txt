christ-centered education


                           sonlight allows our daughter to hear the message of christ in our homeschool. she is able to walk alongside christ in her bible study and see christ’s everyday lessons in the books she reads. we are proud to be a sonlight family."
                         — the a. family sonlighters







incredible value


                            sonlight is such a blessing. best investment we have made in our homeschool. our family is closer and wiser because of all the time spent reading great books together."

                        relationships


                           we love sonlight because of the flexibility, the robust academics, the adaptability through the years, and the cultivation of the kids' worldview through all the well-chosen books. but #1 has to be the relationships we've built with our kids through all that reading together!” 
                          — the c. family sonlighters







no lesson planning!


                           homeschooling has allowed us to teach our children to love god, cherish their family and develop their own personalities without the influence of today’s culture. after homeschooling for many years, i became exhausted by the thought of gathering books and materials. sonlight has it all organized and planned for me!"
                          — the k. family sonlighters







biblical perspective


                           i love that sonlight has a godly and mission-focused heart that has us praying and looking to christian examples through the ages! in this world it is so important to share our faith along with a solid education. so thankful that sonlight has provided the backing i need for both those elements!"
                           — the b. family sonlighters

                   i never thought i could—or would—homeschool my daughter. sonlight has made homeschooling not only doable, but one of the best gifts we could ever bestow on our daughter. thank you, sonlight, for offering a christ-centered, literature-rich, home-based program for children!"

                    — the b. family, sonlighters from johnson city, tn









                   i planned to homeschool for one year, but god had a better plan. we fell in love with learning together. we traded the rat race of public school for snuggling on the couch and for adventuring with books in tow. sonlight has given us the tools we need to be successful, and we thank god every day for our lifestyle. i have zero doubts about our choice to homeschool even when the world offers its opinion. thank you, sonlight."

                    — the g. family, sonlighters from fayetteville, ga









                    we pulled our daughter out of public school in the 3rd grade (her report card was all d’s). now with sonlight’s help, she graduated a year early, with honors and a college scholarship! sonlight has made all the difference. thank you sonlight for an amazing and truly life changing journey."
