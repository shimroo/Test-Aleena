borat 2000-2007 - happy times!


the top five 
							areas of this site that you must visit are below:
1.
							the guide to the borat 
							movie


how 
							dare you make hand party over pamela?

many tv characters fall flat on 
							their faces when it comes to making the jump to the 
							big screen. borat didn't. the movie was a massive success. 
							a golden globe best performance award for sacha 
							baron cohen, a golden globe nomination for best 
							picture and an academy award nomination for best 
							writing.

we agree with empire magazine, 
							this is a film that will endure and mature like 
							airplane! and this is spinal tap.
