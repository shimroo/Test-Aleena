customer reviews






			by far the best harley davidson repair shop in town. i’ve brought my bike there for years and always been satisfied.  the mechanic steve is one of the most knowledgeable i’ve ever met.  they are fair and honest and professional.


			~ chris r.
			




			once in a while you run across a business that is run by people that love what they do so much, you can’t imaging them doing anything else! o school is one of those places! the owners clearly love their job, and it shows!!


			~ kent t.
			




			this is a great place to get your bike serviced and modified. the crew here actually takes the time to explain all your options to you.
