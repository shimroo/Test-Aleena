 enjoy tranquility along the island’s trails



martha’s vineyard turns a welcome corner in the off-season, gradually settling into a gentle rhythm that feels miles away from summer’s hustle and bustle.
even as the days grow cooler, there’s plenty to enjoy here in the great outdoors. the island’s land conservation groups offer a wide range of public events and activities, including the ever-popular winter guided walks. the events listing on the free trailsmv app is a great resource for tapping into these off-season activities. the app also includes suggested walking and biking routes (excursions), along with information about properties that are more accessible for people with limited mobility.
see detailed information from trails mv and the all-island trails committee.
