president's welcome


welcome to gwac’s 2024-2025 bar year!
greetings gwac members, friends, and supporters,
welcome to the 2024 -2025 gwac bar year! 
i am filled with a profound sense of humility and pride as i embark on a new chapter as the president of gwac during its momentous 50th-year anniversary. this milestone is not just a numerical marker but a symbol of endurance, resilience, and the enduring commitment of our members throughout the decades. in commemorating this golden anniversary, we pay tribute to the vision and dedication of our esteemed founder, barbara e. whiting-wright, whose pioneering spirit laid the foundation for the vibrant community that gwac is today. we also honor the legacy of past presidents whose leadership and guidance have shaped gwac's history and enriched our collective experience. as we celebrate our golden jubilee, let us take a moment to reflect on the profound impact that gwac and its members have had on the greater washington community. from advocating for black women attorneys to empowering future leaders, our contributions have left an indelible mark on the fabric of our society. 
 
in assuming the role of president, i am thrilled to unveil a series of transformative initiatives that will chart a new course for gwac's future. the "50 for 50" campaign stands as a bold declaration of our commitment to growth and inclusivity. by aiming to recruit 50 new members, welcome back 50 former members, and engage 50 law students, we seek to expand our community and amplify our impact in the years to come. furthermore, we will establish the inaugural class of 50 life members, a group of distinguished individuals whose unwavering support and dedication will serve as a cornerstone for gwac's continued success. through their guidance, mentorship, and investment, life members will nurture the next generation of leaders and advocates, ensuring that gwac's legacy endures for future generations.
 
as we embark on this journey towards a future filled with promise and possibility, i invite you to join me in this noble endeavor. your participation is not just welcomed, it is integral to our mission. it is because of you that we have reached this milestone, and it is with you that we will continue to grow and succeed. i want to express my deepest gratitude for your unwavering support. here's to a golden jubilee filled with hope, opportunity, and endless possibilities.

sincerely,
tracey g. jackson, ph.d., esq.
