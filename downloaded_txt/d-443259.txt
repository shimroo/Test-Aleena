i lucid dream for a living
 















photographer. filmmaker. writer. raised in new orleans. based in nyc. available for commissions and exhibitions internationally. i mix art and fashion with technology. i photographed women on the march, and veterans campaigning. i believe photography is time travel, and representation matters. i’m behind those viral hysterical literature videos. i got zef with die antwoord. my long portraits inspired a superbowl commercial. i got dirty during hurricane katrina. i think subculture is culture. i think deeply about how the present creates the future.follow me on instagramread more

view special projects"there is little distinction for him, it appears, between the personal and the professional. as a photographer, he has crossed the proverbial line, including himself - as voyeur and participant - in an on-camera life that utterly obliterates the distinction between object and subject, rendering objectivity an archaic term. with his rock star dalliances and a desire to marry high-art style and low-brow subjects, cubitt sits at the photographic edge." –eyemazing
