						hole 1, par 4 – handicap 1
						



a solid drive favoring the left center of the fairway will avoid a dangerous cluster of bunkers on the right. the wide green offers an inviting target which will accept run-up shots.


black - 425
green - 390
gold - 320
silver - 304




						hole 2, par 3 – handicap 18 
						



the back right pin position requires precise club selection and imagination! the green is deeper than it appears.


black - 181
green - 152
gold - 131
silver - 111




						hole 3, par 4 – handicap 4
						



water and out of bounds right dictate prudence over distance off the tee. water on the right and sand behind the green will test the nerves. ample "bail out" area on the left.


black - 385
green - 365
gold - 339
silver - 282




						hole 4, par 5- handicap 2 
						



a solid drive from all the tees is required on the demanding par 5. pay careful heed to exact water hazard locations. the small green will yield birdies to those fortunate enough to arrive in regulation.
black - 535
green - 505
gold - 446
silver - 411




						hole 5, par 4 – handicap 16 
						



a ridge of sand down the spine of the hole suggests the smart play is on the left. a ball right of the bunkers may find an uneven lie and a difficult approach to a shallow target.

black - 332
green - 312
gold - 289
silver - 251




						hole 6, par 5 – handicap 14 
						



the shortest of the par 5s, the sixth rewards the solid driver with a choice. water on the left from 120 yards in and a collection of bunkers to the right of the green will punish the bold but errant second. the small, undulating green will pose the final challenge.

black - 332
green - 312
gold - 289
silver - 251




						hole 7, par 3 – handicap 8 
						



the longest of the four par 3s, the green rises gently from the fairway. the bunkers on the left form a false front; the green is 35 yards beyond. take one extra club.

black - 230
green - 210
gold -  194
silver - 173





						hole 8, par 4 – handicap 12 
						



as with all great short par 4s, length is not an issue. know your exact distance to reach and carry the fairway bunkers on the left. the green is 46 yards deep and bordered by sand and water along the entire right side. club selection is critical to avoid 3-putts.

black - 353
green - 325
gold - 270
silver - 222




						hole 9, par 4 – handicap 6 
						



water off the tee and fairway bunkers on the left are generally not in play. water on the left and behind the green, however, are! this difficult par 4 requires two confident shots to reach the green in two.

black - 404
green - 383
gold - 364
silver - 239

















































						hole 10, par 5 – handicap 7 
						



a tight and relatively short par five, number ten shows its teeth near the elevated green. large bunkers right and water long and left will capture the wayward effort. the green is larger than it appears
black - 541
green - 466
gold - 424
silver - 396




						hole 11, par 4 – handicap 9 
						



an ample fairway awaits a solid tee shot on hawk's landing's signature par 4. all who pass must negotiate water fronting and guarding the right side of the green. the green is large and the challenge is clear.
black - 385
green - 358
gold - 338
silver - 240




						hole 12, par 4 – handicap 5 
						



a tight undulating fairway requires a careful drive. although there are no green side bunkers, the green is surrounded by collection areas requiring clever shot making.
black - 425
green - 361
gold - 342
silver - 289




						hole 13, par 3 – handicap 15 
						



depending on pin location, this picturesque par 3 calls for distinctly different strategies. on the right, water behind the green comes into play. on the left a less than smartly struck effort will find a watery grave.
black - 160
green - 143
gold - 102
silver - 86




						hole 14, par 4 – handicap 3 
						



the longest of the par fours at 432 yards, the 14th requires two excellent shots to earn a birdie putt. water off the tee is reachable by only the longest of hitters. "false front" bunkers conceal 15 yards of fairway cut between sand and putting surface. use the fairway landing area to the right of the green is out of reach. 
black - 422
green - 410
gold - 387
silver - 332




						hole 15, par 3 – handicap 17 
						



judge the wind and club selection carefully on the shortest of the par 3. the green is 40 yards deep.           

black - 142
green - 123
gold - 110
silver - 94




						hole 16, par 4 – handicap 13
						



favor the right side of the fairway to avoid ominous bunkers and to provide a clear view of the green. the water on the right wraps around the green requiring caution when the flag is at the rear. the green slopes gently from front to back.
black - 390
green - 357
gold - 308
silver - 274




						hole 17, par 4 – handicap 11 
						



club selection is critical to scoring on this testy par 4. a shallow green guarded by false front bunkers present challenges to mis-clubbed tee-shots. ample space behind the green for over-clubbing, but variety of trees provide short-game test.

black - 275
green - 263
gold - 225
silver - 212




						hole 18, par 3 – handicap 1 
						



welcome to the finishing hole, our island green! sitting at 204 yards from the tips, this hole will leave you with a challenge. carry the water and get the ball to stick to the green for an easy par.
black - 204
green - 166
blue - 108
gold - 108
silver - 83
