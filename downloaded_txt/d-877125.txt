"his pinot was the darkest, ripest, and the most potent of the evening; ....i predict a brilliant future for him as a winemaker."
jay mcinerney "a hedonist in the cellar"






















"benjamin silver is one of the rising stars in santa barbara; wines from purchased fruit are always exciting, often sublime."
anthony dias blue, 2006






















"these wines are made by benjamin silver and show lots of polish. the 4-barrel syrah is a stunning effort, and if it firms up and shows a touch more structure, it will be even better than the note suggests."
jeb dunnuck






















"benjamin silver is an unusually talented winemaker....as he has no vineyards of his own, he is necessarily dependent upon others for his grapes. yet what he does with those grapes is impressive. even a nebbiolo, a grape no one has succeeded with in california so far, came closer to hitting the mark than any other i've tried. when he can obtain choice fruit, benjamin silver creates superb wines."
matt kramer's new california wine
