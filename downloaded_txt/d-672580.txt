"since memory is frail, 
sayings and deeds have to be reinforced by the evidence of writing, so that 
neither length of time nor the cunning of posterity can obscure the knowledge of 
past events" (from a twelfth century 
notification by william de braose of a grant of lands to sele priory - british 
records association)

please
note that i have an updated email address
  the site is divided into sections
that are listed in the table of contents. 
the genealogy pages "family history" are
quite extensive. to  facilitate the additional information i have created a family history index that should assist in the navigation of
that section. i have also included in the index, a general section that contains articles that are
associated with the history of my family.  nearly all the people who appear in 
the family history pages are no longer living and so this section of the site is 
in effect a memorial as well as a resource. i hope that you'll find the family 
history pages interesting and informative. i will of course be delighted to hear 
from anyone who can provide me with further insights and information with regard 
to my ancestors. 

november 16  is my date of birth and so that section
of the site deals naturally enough with the births, deaths and
events that have occurred on that date. i have also provided an account of a 
murder
that occurred on that day in leeds that ended in a judicial execution.
  
 school days - incidentally they were not "the
happiest days of my life" gives a personal view of what it was like to
attend a provincial grammar school in the 1960's as well as providing a counterbalance to
many of the wild and inaccurate claims surrounding post war education in the u.k.   

britain and the
world since 1953 is
intended to put a perspective on the events that have occurred in
my lifetime. it is in effect a chronology and almanac with
links to other websites and areas of information. the content is
continually being extended and it is hoped that it will become a
useful reference tool when completed.  there is also a page compares
the britain of 1953 with the britain of 2003
the 
location map is a directional guide for those visiting the
area where i live. this section has also been extended to include a history of the road i live on
(spring hill) and the  area  of the city (crookes-walkley district ) i live in. 
i have posted to that section, details extracted from the various uk census' for 
spring hill as well as excerpts from a number of kelly's directories  - 
a
full index of photographs and articles has been also been posted to the section.

 i have also added my acknowledgements to people who have spared me their
time and effort in providing me with content and information. it is greatly
appreciated.   
there is also
a copyright notice which i hope will ensure that the information
on this site is not sullied by crass commercialism. any errors are of course mine and mine alone.
"to remain ignorant of what 
happened before you were born is to remain always a child"  - cicero
in november 2010 i decided that i 
would create a "blog" to compliment and enhance this website. the site was over twelve 
years old at the time, and i wanted to expand the content of the site to include information 
that i have come across but was not detailed enough to warrant an article. it 
would also allow me to comment on more contemporary matters that effect the area 
i live in, and also keep people updated on the articles posted. with a nod to crookes in particular, and sheffield in general,
my blog is called 


view from a hill .


"in the end, we will remember not the words of our
enemies, but the silence of our friends". martin luther king jnr 

nearly 18 months after setting up
view from a hill, i took the plunge and in collaboration with
matthew bell i had my first 
printed book published.  




"thirteen years in the making, 
sheffield's shocking past is the literary debut by chris hobbs. ably assisted by 
fellow author matthew bell, this book contains some of the most bizarre, little 
known and tragic incidents of victorian times.
multiple murders; child murderers; a burning boy running half a mile before his agonizing
death; strange deaths; untimely deaths; deaths by starvation; hideous 
accidents; a romantic double suicide and a factory explosion killing all in its 
wake".   
if you want further information 
about the book and its contents please follow the link to the page - 
sheffield's shocking past - forgotten tales of murder, mishap & gruesome misdemeanour 
by chris hobbs & matthew bell

sheffield star newspaper printed an article featuring this website and the book 
on monday 2nd april 2012. the 
sheffield telegraph newspaper printed an article featuring this website and the book 
on thursday 10th may 2012



on november 16th 2012 the second 
book was published . this
book covers the twentieth century up to 1960. 
"history has a nasty habit of 
repeating itself. it was february 1934 and men were screaming for help as the 
leppings lane section of the bulging 72,860 hillsborough crowd swayed forward 
and crushed them against iron railings. george frederick hill died from multiple 
fractures and shock. tragedy had also struck twenty years earlier when a 
retaining wall collapsed at the same ground. the match was suspended as scores 
of injured were rushed to sheffield infirmary. life-long sheffielder and 
historian chris hobbs and local author matthew bell have once again delved into 
the archives - this time bringing you some of the most gruesome, grizzly and 
long-forgotten tragic episodes of 20th century sheffield. sheffield's shocking 
past - part ii leaves no coroner's report unchecked as it uncovers the killer 
cat of millhouses; death by chimneystack; one of the city's earliest fatal motor 
accidents and the story behind the charred remains of a male midget and his 
mechanical teddy bear female companion. the events surrounding some incidents 
are hard to contemplate until you read the full facts: there's death by scalding 
at heeley baths; a treeton man drowned looking for his chickens; a low edges 
resident who accidentally killed his wife, and the horrific aftermath of an 
american air force jet crashing into lodge moor hospital in 1955. one of the 
most tragic cases must be that of 22-year-old nurse ada bradley. she thought she 
was helping rehabilitate a former mental patient by inviting her into her home 
to live. instead, "she was found dead with her head battered and her throat cut 
in the street near the asylum." sheffield's shocking past - part ii takes you 
from the time of the horse and carriage to the age of the jet plane, along the 
way unearthing some of the saddest and most remarkable incidents in the history 
of the city."

the 
sheffield star newspaper printed an article featuring this website and the book 
on monday 12th november 2012
the third book was published on 21st
march 2014 but unlike the first two, this was focused on sheffield and the great war. 

"the great war had a devastating effect on sheffield. hundreds of the citys young men were slaughtered on the first day of the disastrous somme offensive. a shocking german zeppelin raid dropped death from the skies above sheffield in september 1916. church rolls of honour and war memorials still bear their names but their stories are largely forgotten, until now.

long shadows over sheffield -
forgotten voices of the great war unearths some of the most jaw-dropping tales of the men who willingly gave up their civilian jobs to make the ultimate sacrifice for king and country.
from the 67-year-old sheffield resident who became one of the oldest men to die in the war, to the 15-year-old from nether edge whose fascination with the sea led to his death in battle.
the suffering didnt end with the cessation of hostilities. survivors  including three of the citys holders of the victoria cross  relived the unspeakable carnage for the rest of their lives, whilst the grief of wives and parents is laid bare in previously unpublished correspondence.

graphic newspaper reports are mixed with rare photographs and a sheffield soldiers personal war diary to provide a memorable tapestry of hardship, heartbreak and horror that was the result of the
great war which began a century ago."

one of the deepest impulses in man is the impulse to
record, to scratch a drawing on the tusk or keep a diary, to collect sagas and
heap cairns. this instinct as to the enduring value of the past is, one might
say, the very basis of civilization" - john jay chapman

"to the living we
owe our respect, to the dead we owe nothing but the
truth."             voltaire.
 

the articles on sheffield are updated as and when relevant material becomes available. most of
the articles are based on information i came across whilst researching in the local 
archives and reading old newspapers. i have tried only to put content on the 
site that is not easily available elsewhere and so that is why there are no 
articles on the sheffield flood, charlie peace, the hillsborough disaster etc. i 
am also conscious of the need not to compromise the privacy of the living and so 
the articles are definitely historical in perspective. i try wherever possible to adhere to the 
"forty year rule."    

some cities love their 
antiquities, sheffield has few to boast of, and therefore treats them with 
scorn. someday it will regret it - sheffield daily independent (1906)
