who is the ascension historical society?




    our history
  



the ascension historical society is a ministry of the greek orthodox cathedral of the ascension in oakland, ca. the historical society was created in 1989 by mary k. mousalimas as a means of preserving the history of the church since its beginning in 1917.
























ahs library and archives
since 1989, volunteers have spent countless hours interviewing people, gathering artifacts and memorabilia, sharing information, and asking questions to learn more. the current ahs archive and library holds 100+ years of history highlighting the ascension cathedral community, and its ministries as well as many items reflecting the greater hellenic community & experience.

oral history collection
starting in the mid-1970s several members of the church began interviewing more senior church members and family members in order to gather the oral history of the church and life as it was for greek immigrants in oakland.
