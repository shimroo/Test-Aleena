					"new" serpent spyder sdx4 titan
				


				by 
nicolas petit, in news petitrc, november 25, 2020











					this is a description of the buggy 4wd serpent spyder sdx4 titan revisited by pavel dostàl alias frufli.
	voici présentation du serpent spyder sdx4 titan revu par pavel dostàl alias frufli.



	 



	 



	carbon chassis, carbon side plate, titanium screw, titanium turn buckle, titanium center bone, titanium slipper shaft, titanium slipper outdrive, titanium diff oitdrive, titanium cvd gear coupler, titanium cvd driveshaft fr-rr, titanium cvd wheelaxle fr-rr, titanium pivot pin rr-fr, titanium m3 and m4 worm imbus, new alu suspension bracket with the possibility of adjusting the arms in all directions, new alu shocktower, new alu steeringrack with ball bearings, alu servosaver, new alu steering set, bearings with ceramic balls. possibility to adjust the flexibility of the chassis. the lightest 4wd buggy in the world (1510- 1540g), thanks to the universal shape of the side panels, it is possible to use bodies of all known manufacturers( xray, asso, team lossi, yokomo).



	according frufli " i often have more and more improvements in my thoughts. however, some are very complex for amateur production, such as a new type of wheel suspension so that the shock absorbers can be used horizontally. a very simple principle occurred to me, but new wheel suspensions would have to be made for this type. furthermore, it would be easy to produce active swivel rear wheels and other ideas."

					2020 efra 1/12th track european championships - finals report
				


				by 
nicolas petit, in news petitrc, march 11, 2020











					alexander hagberg started his quest for a seventh consecutive european championship title in his favourite class by immediately pulling a gap over ollie payne and then clicked off the laps unchallenged to take the leg one from ollie with joern neumann having a lonely run to third. leg two was a repeat of leg one at the very front, with ollie just unable to challenge alex, the two both capable of lapping at the same speed but alex looking a little more comfortable at 100%. this allowed him to edge away, crossing the line to retain his title at the earliest possible opportunity at the end of leg two. payne crossed the line in second with freddy sudhoff making his way up to third with the title safely in his pocket alex opted to sit out leg three, presenting an opportunity for the remaining drivers to score a leg win to improve their overall position. joern neumann managed to get ahead of ollie payne early on, and a win combined with his third place in leg one would beat the two second places that ollie had scored. ollie eventually battled his way past joern and proceeded to pull away to take the leg win and secure second overall, with joern’s second place in the leg confirming his place on the overall podium.



	 



	 



	stock




	joern neumann led away from his pole position in leg one, then a small mistake on the opening lap presented markus mobers with an opportunity to make a move for the lead. this also allowed mark stiles and louis parker past joern too, giving markus the chance to build a lead while the rest of the field battled over second position. neumann eventually prevailed to appear at the front of the chasing pack, but too late to present a challenge to mobers who took home the leg win from neumann and a hard charging louis parker in third. leg two proved to be relatively uneventful, with neumann taking a lights to flag win from mobers with stiles in third, meaning the title would be decided in the third leg. neumann led leg three away, but was unable to shake the attention of mobers who remained within one second of joern for the first six minutes, unable to quite get close enough to make a move but not allowing him any breathing space either. eventually neumann managed to edge away as the pair carved through the traffic, crossing the line in the lead to secure his maiden european championship title in the 1/12th class. markus finished second again to secure second overall, while mark stiles took third in the leg to ensure he would take the final step on the overall podium.

					2020 - brca lmp12 round 5 race report
				


				by 
nicolas petit, in race results onroad pro 12 & pro 10 & f1 electric, march 5, 2020





					round five of the 2019/20 brca lmp12 nationals was hosted by barley mow club in birtley in the north of england last weekend. a reduced entry compared to the last round didn’t detract from the excellent racing this championship has become known for. the event took place in a large hall with the club laying a flowing layout with a variety of corners requiring careful car setup and consistent driving to get the best time from the circuit.





	saturday would see drivers competing in 13.5 and 17.5 stock classes. in the 13.5 class there was a three way battle between david spashett, current stock world champion andy murray and louis parker for pole position. in round three andy and louis posted identical times after swapping first and second by a tenth or two throughout the eight minute run. at the end of qualifying it would be andy who would claim the front spot from david spashett and louis parker with mark stiles very close behind in fourth. in the final all cars would get away cleanly with andy opening up an early lead with david giving chase. an early mistake by louis would allow mark through and having more pace he managed to gain a small lead over louis. andy would take a tone to tone win with pace that allowed him to be the only driver to make it on to the 39th lap at the tone. david would finish in second with mark stiles in third place and louis in fourth. 



	f1 13.5 stock result






	1                   andy murray - schumacher



	2                   david spashett – zen racing

	8                   aaron morley - roche



	9                   nathanael goodban – schumacher 



	10                 matthew lax – xray



	 



	 



	the 13.5 class also contains a f2 championship.  pole position would go to james chappell who was trying his hand at 12th circuit for the first time rather than his usual class of 10th offroad. mark rogers would line up second from last round’s winner david underwood.  james would take a tone to tone win with david keeping him honest but unable to challenge for the win. mark rogers would be involved in an early incident after making a mistake and would finish off the podium. james eaves would complete the top three after racing from 5th on the grid.

	in 17.5 mark jewitt was the man to beat topping the time sheets in all four rounds of qualifying. he would line up ahead of peter craig and gavin clinch. in the final mark had terrific pace and with a clean and consistent run he finished 2 laps clear of the rest of the field. gavin clinch would finish second with andy sawyer completing the top three from fifth on the grid.

	sunday would see the open modified class take to the track and there would be more 13.5 turn blinky racing in the sports class. 



	 



	in modified it was a battle for pole between andy murray and louis parker with louis winning out to claim the front spot. adam catchpole would line up third. in the final the lead two cars would immediately gap the rest of the field with the two cars following each other closely until a mistake at two minutes from louis would allow andy through. louis was immediately back onto the tail of andy and capitalised on a mistake to then drive a clean and consistent race bringing his car home for his first brca national win. andy would finish second with adam finishing in third.

	6                   graham dick- schumacher



	7                   barry lynch- schumacher



	 



	the current series leader olly jeffries was not able to attend this event but the result means that with one round remaining he was unable to be caught in the championship. congratulations to olly jeffries, brca lmp12 open modified champion 2019/20. 



	 



	in sports david spashett lined up on pole looking to wrap up the sports championship after having to settle for third at the last round. david was in commanding form leading all four rounds of qualifying. mark stiles would line up second with mark jewitt and adam mackman close behind. in the final david would pull a gap on mark and maintain this throughout the eight minutes to take the win and the overall championship. congratulations, david spashett, brca lmp12 sports champion 2019/20. mark stiles would finish second but it was all change behind after an early mistake in the chicane by mark jewitt would shake the order up. ben vincent would be the one to take advantage of this and completed the podium from fifth on the grid.

					2020 - brca lmp12 nationals round 4 race report
				


				by 
nicolas petit, in race results onroad pro 12 & pro 10 & f1 electric, february 3, 2020





					round four of the 2019/20 brca lmp12 nationals took place in chesterfield last weekend. a capacity entry of 85 drivers took part in the weekend’s racing. unfortunately round 3 of the championship had to be cancelled in december due to structural issues with the venue meaning that the championship has been reduced to three counting rounds from five. chesterfield hit their usual high standards laying a challenging track on perfectly smooth carpet laid with no tape joins to upset the cars. 



	 



	 



	sunday would see the open modified class take to the track and there would be more 13.5 turn blinky racing in the sports class.



	 



	 




	 



	 



	 



	in modified olly jeffries would take his second pole position of the weekend from louis parker and andy murray and ollie payne. this time olly would have difficulty getting his car off the line and unfortunately louis parker would catch the back of his car and exit the circuit. olly jeffries would recover to a commanding victory finishing well clear of the chasing pack. andy murray would finish in second and adam catchpole completed the podium from fifth on the grid. louis parker would recover to fourth place and is surely a driver to watch for the remaining races this season. 



	 



	 



	 



	modified result




	 



	 



	 



	1                   olly jefferies - schumacher



	2                   andy murray - schumacher



	3                   adam catchpole - capricorn



	4                   louis parker - schumacher



	5                   daniel robins - schumacher



	6                   mark rogers - roche



	7                   andy sawyer - schumacher



	8                   george brewer - schumacher



	9                   jonathan simblet - roche



	10                 ollie payne - roche



	 



	saturday would see drivers competing in 13.5 and 17.5 stock classes. winner of the first two rounds olly jeffries would be looking to complete the trio this weekend.  from the start it was clear who was the racer to beat with olly topping the timesheets on all four rounds of qualifying. mark stiles would get the closest to olly lining up second on the grid from david spashett and ollie payne. olly would get a clean start and after a first lap error from mark stiles that overturned the car of david spashett would complete the race unchallenged taking his third win and securing the 13.5 stock championship. the early incident mixed up the field and in a fast and controlled drive louis parker who qualified fifth brought his car home in second place, a personal best finish in this class. another great drive from futher down the field would see matthew varah claim the final step on the podium from 7th on the grid. congratulations olly jeffries, 2019/20 brca f1 13.5 stock champion.



	f1 13.5 final result




	1                         olly jefferies - schumacher



	2                         louis parker - schumacher



	3                         matthew varah - roche



	4                         david spashett - roche



	5                         andy murray - schumacher



	6                         mark stiles - roche



	7                         adam mackman - schumacher



	8                         ollie payne - roche



	9                         nathanael goodban - schumacher



	10                       aidan ripley – schumacher 



	 



	 



	 



	the 13.5 class also contains a f2 championship. current leader morgan williams was missing from this event so others were looking to capitalise and it was steve donald who would take pole position from david underwood and ashley king. a mistake off the line would drop steve well down the order and that was all that david needed to head to the front and take the win showing great pace throughout the final. steve would race back to second place and third would be taken by kenneth rogers who raced through the field from 9th on the grid narrowly beating junior driver sam coult into fourth, who in his first lmp national is surely a name we will be seeing more of in the future. 



	f2 13.5 final result




	1                   david underwood - schumacher



	2                   steve donald - schumacher



	3                   kenneth rogers - schumacher



	4                   samuel coult - schumacher



	5                   simon pole - schumacher



	6                   james eaves - schumacher



	7                   peter stockton - schumacher



	8                   ashley king - schumacher



	9                   stuart barber - crc



	10                 tony wade – schumacher



	 



	 



	 



	in 17.5 marcus askell was looking to secure the championship after winning the first two rounds. in qualifying he showed the form that he has had all season and lined up on pole half a lap clear of mark jewitt in second place. niall cochran would line up third just ahead of andy sawyer. marcus and mark would stretch an early lead over a three way battle for third between niall, andy and adrian thorpe.  mark had found some extra pace from qualifying and in the second half of the race closed up on marcus. despite having the faster car and trying different lines to find a clean pass mark would finish second after marcus drove clean and defended well to take the win and secure the championship.  the battle for third would be won by andy sawyer with niall in fourth. congratulations marcus askell, 2019/20 brca 17.5 stock champion.

	in sports david spashett lined up on pole looking to secure the sports championship after winning the first two rounds.  qualifying was very close with mark stiles leading the times for the first two rounds before david took pole position by a second. ben vincent would line up third and andrew smith in fourth.  a clean start would see mark in hot pursuit of david before an uncharacteristic early mistake would allow mark to pass and take the lead. another touch of the barriers would drop david further down the field. mark was not going to waste this opportunity and drove a clean race to take the win. ben vincent would finish in second place and after an exciting battle with andrew smith, david would recover to third place. third was not enough to secure the championship and we are sure to have some more great racing in the remaining rounds.

problème de vitesse en ligne droite
by 
octa · posted october 11, 2022

								bonjour,
 


	je me permets de poster un message car j'ai un soucis avec ma voiture rc (tt 1/10e 4x2). j'ai un combo hobbywing quickrun 60a avec un moteur 17.5t et un accu ws line (50c / 7200ma / 7.4v).
 


	lorsque je pose la voiture sur la piste, elle fonctionne parfaitement. je fais un tour, et arrivé dans la ligne droite (pour la seconde fois donc), à fond, j'atteint environ 25 km/h (vitesse prise avec un radar) ce qui est ridicule comparé à mon 1er passage. 
 


	avez vous une idée d'où peut venir mon problème de puissance? je vous avoue ne pas savoir dans quelle direction chercher (je suis un débutant).
 


	voici la liste des réglages que j'ai essayé pour palier mon soucis:
 


	- j'ai refait le neutre de mon esc
 


	- j'ai retiré le cut off
 


	- j'ai essayé une autre batterie que la mienne
 


	je précise également que j'ai beaucoup de puissance au démarrage (j'ai réglé le punch à fond)
 


	j'ai également réglé le timing moteur à fond.
 


	 
 


	si une âme charitable à quelques minutes à perdre pour m'aider ce serait super.
 


	 
 


	bonne journée à tous :).
