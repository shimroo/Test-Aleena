what educators have to say about i-ready
"what we like about i-ready is it gives each student a personalized learning path for both reading and mathematics and it’s based on their diagnostic results. i do a spreadsheet, and put my diagnostic data, and then put my ohio state test data right next to each other . . . and just using that data is like a motivational tool with our staff."
—jocelyn vanell, instructional coach
