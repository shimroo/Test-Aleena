        i know how to recognize quality when i see it & coda is definitely a quality outfit
      


          i am a coda customer since 2004. i have made over 10 trips with jim and his team, visiting 4 continents with them and in excess of 25 countries and destinations. the service is very professional and dedicated, always with the best accommodations available, and an emphasis on the security and well-being of the customers; as in some places of the world, it is not always obvious for gay travelers. the choice of destinations always offers traditional and more unusual selections. my family has spent over 75 years in the tour operating business, and i know how to recognize quality when i see it. coda is definitely a quality outfit.

      we just returned from coda's south east asia tour of laos, vietnam,  cambodia and thailand.  we had an amazing trip!  the itinerary was a perfect mix of historical & cultural sites with some free time in each city. we had several experimental type activities like the vespa eating tour of saigon!  all of our guides were excellent.  the hotels were exceptional and all first class.  we had a great group of people on this tour, the chemistry of the group greatly added to the enjoyment an fun of this tour.  this was my 5th trip with coda and they continue to provide exceptional luxury trips.  highly recommend them for your travel!

      we've used jim smith and coda tours for about 20 years, both for small-group tours as well as international travel arrangements. highly recommended for imaginative itineraries, decent prices and first-rate service. and if you've ever had to deal with a cruise company's customer-service desk, you already know you need a savvy pro like jim in your corner.

      great trip, and i would highly recommend coda!  nicely organized with lots of good activities, plus some down time for recharging your batteries. the tour guides arranged by coda were all great, and the members of the traveling group also got along well. would definitely take another trip with them!

    the years of combined travel experience between jim and duni were evident from the beginning of our portugal adventure and continued until we parted. service, food, accommodations, and guides were all excellent. there was a great group of friendly guys on the trip. it was great that there were local guides for each stop on our journey.

 coda's small group luxury tours are a terrific way to visit those parts of the world you might hesitate to travel to, on your own.

i recently returned from my 10th coda trip and each one has been outstanding in so many ways.  i had the pleasure of working with jim smith for the first time in 2005 while living overseas and accompanying a coda tour to turkey.  since then jim has planned three solo trips for me to south africa, russia and peru.   jim has lead many other trips i have been on and i was introduced to agron zyberaj in china where he and jim both led our group.  most recently, i met duni bauta in portugal and the trip was a delight and duni a great addition to the coda team.   coda has been at the forefront of destinations for gay travelers and i highly recommend his trips and look forward to my next one!

i have taken 9 tours with coda in 21 years, visiting 15 countries.  every trip was extremely well organized, with fascinating destinations, and wonderful travel companions.  i cannot say enough wonderful things about the coda experience.
