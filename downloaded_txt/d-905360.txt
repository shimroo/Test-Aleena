making of mystic india
'mystic india' is the first large format film about india made by an indian organization. it is a monumental period film produced by baps swaminarayan sanstha with the talent of renowned experts of the large format film industry and the dedication of volunteers.





location scout
for a period film, and an large format film at that, a location has to be as far away from âcivilizationâ as possible, so that no electric cables, telephone poles or modern homes are visible â and yet be near an easily accessible road so that it doesnât take time to reach and set up the shots. these opposing requirements were only part of the constraints for the location scout.





cast
with a total cast of 45,000, mystic india had the biggest cast ever in any large format film. director keith melton said about the huge 8000 cast, at the end of the rath yatra scene shoot, âwere it not for the wonderful discipline, cooperation, patience, and dedication of the baps extras, this moment would not have been possible.â 





volunteers
each of these 570 volunteers made their best contributions, yet chose unanimously to remain unnamed in the filmâs credits â they were not working for money or fame, but for this epic film about their country. the film does not name any of them in deference to their wishes that their service to india as a country and mystic india as a representative of their culture remain unnamed.

             âof course what it does emphasise is how remarkable india is. before long, i hope i should be able to take my wife to the various parts of india i havenât managed to see yet. please donât let the world lose that, because it is the balance between modernity and tradition, and the ancient wisdom which actually is going to ensure the survival of all of us, and our grandchildren, and those who come later.â
