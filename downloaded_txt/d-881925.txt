welcome to m.k. rawlings elementary






school mission
educate and prepare each student for college, career, and life.
 
school dress code
allowed tops:    

plain solid heather grey, hunter green, purple, or navy-blue polo shirts, short sleeve and/or long sleeve with collar and button placket.
polo shirts may not have any contrasting colors, logos, or monograms.
rawlings school clubs and pta t-shirts only.

allowed bottoms:     

navy/gray uniform shorts, navy/ gray uniform pants, navy/ gray cargo shorts, navy/ gray polo dresses, navy/ gray jumpers, navy/ gray skorts, navy/ gray skirts
** students wearing dresses and skirts must wear the appropriate fitted shorts/capris underneath in navy.
fabric must be polyester, or cotton twill and may not have any contrasting colors, logos, monograms, or tags.

cold weather clothing:

hunter green, grey, purple & navy sweaters, cardigans, and crewneck sweatshirts are allowed as long as they have no hoods attached to them. any outside wear not following dress code must be removed before entering classrooms.

clothing not allowed in classrooms under new uniform policy:

jeans, sweatpants, lycra or spandex fabric, corduroy fabric, leggings, basketball shorts, hats, bandanas, sweatbands, distracting hair accessories, colorful socks or socks with patterns, sweatshirts with hoods attached or logos and designs will not be allowed.
we are going to enforce this uniform policy daily at rawlings elementary school.
we are preparing children for the future, and it begins here today.  therefore, parents/ guardians will be called to pick up their student or to bring a change of uniform when this policy is not being followed. students will be stopped at the gate and front office when out of dress code.

 
**kindergarten** please put a change of clothing in your child’s backpack (socks, underwear, uniform shirt and uniform bottom) in case of an accident.  if you would like to donate clothing to our school, that would be greatly appreciated.
