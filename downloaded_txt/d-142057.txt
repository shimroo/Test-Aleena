you are on the
leading edge of altered-state theory.
announcement: new website 2023: egodeaththeory.wordpress.com
https://egodeaththeory.wordpress.com
- the theory of psychedelic eternalism: religious myth, visionary plants,
frozen block universe, & transformation of personal control.
i started this new wordpress website october 2020 and almost
immediately made a huge breakthrough following up john lash's "discovery
of a lifetime": the great mushroom psalter, by eadwine
around 1200.
tons of leading-edge content, including the radical maximal
entheogen theory of religion.  check out the
flagship
articles, such as:
·      
proof
that the canterbury psalters leg-hanging mushroom tree is psilocybe
- decoded eadwine's main image, of cubensis initiation, in terms of transforming the mental
world model from possibilism to eternalism, to transform the mind's model of control-in-world
over a series of loose cognitive binding sessions, as the ultimate "effect"
of psilocybin.
·      
compelling
evidence & proof of explicit psilocybin mushrooms in christian art to
communicate non-branching stable control
·      
the
75 mushroom trees of the canterbury psalter
·      
gallery
of mushrooms in christian art
·      
possibilism
vs. eternalism: two models of time and control

for psychedelic psychometrics questionnaires - dec. 2022-jan. 2023 major
research, posted many webpages about the main questionnaires.
i've been posting the theory of ego transcendence online since
1991 on the well, such as this 1997
cybtrans.com precursor to egodeath.com, at archive.org.
the main article, below, lacked recognition of {handedness}
and {nonbranching} during 2006-2021, but turns out that the first image
(the st. eustace window) is awesome far beyond "there's a psilocybin mushroom".  and the last image has ariadne holding {branching}
in {left arm} - these are absolutely key mythemes, now decoded at egodeaththeory.wordpress.com.

introduction and overview
this research defines and outlines the ego
death theory, as a new systematic research framework and paradigm.  the ego
death theory holds that the essence and origin of religion is the use of
visionary plants to routinely trigger the intense mystic altered state,
producing loose cognitive-association binding, which then produces an
experience of being controlled by frozen block-universe determinism with a
single, pre-existing, ever-existing future.
experiencing this model of control and time
initially destabilizes self-control power, and amounts to the death of the self
that was conceived of as an autonomous control-agent.  self-control stability is restored upon
transforming one's mental model to take into account the dependence of personal
control on a hidden, separate thought-source, such as necessity or a divine
level that transcends necessity.
myth describes this mystic-state
experiential insight and transformation. 
religious initiation teaches and causes this transformation of the self considered as a control-agent, through a series of
visionary-plant sessions, interspersed with study of perennial philosophy.  most modern-era religion has been a
distortion of this standard initiation system, reducing these concepts to a
weak interpretation that is based in the ordinary state of consciousness.  the ego death theory is, specifically, the
cybernetic theory of ego transcendence, and it incorporates the entheogen
theory of religion.

covering the egodeath theory.
discussion of
questions in preparation for my interview on the psychonautica
podcast. august 1, 2007.
part
1 part 2 part 3 part 4
max's questions: 

how did i first begin to
     formulate the egodeath theory? 
how important are the various
     domains for the egodeath theory? is the theory a form of eastern, western,
     or shamanistic religion? 
is the issue of freewill of
     central importance to ego death? 
how did i get the idea that
     the issue of freewill is of such central importance to ego death? 
explain the ordinary
     understanding of autonomous control which the ego-death experience proves
     to be illusory. 
what does the 'transcendence
     of no freewill' mean and involve? 
explain the concept of
     block-universe determinism and time as a spacelike dimension. 
how does egodeath theory
     relate to the shamanic ability to heal? 
does saying that drug-free
     meditation is 'bunk' mean that there is no value to the practice of
     meditating? 
explain the idea that
     'drug-policy reform' is conceptually brainwashed. 
what should pro-justice
     activists focus their efforts on doing, to be most effective? 
what are the vulnerabilities
     of the wasson-allegro-mckenna theories of the origin of religion? 
what is my take on mckenna's
     idea of the 'stoned ape'? 
what is the relevance of the ahistoricity of jesus to the egodeath theory? 
how do i envision the future
     for the development of the egodeath theory? 
what is the relationship
     between the disappearance of the separate-self sense, the experience of
     nonduality, the intense mystic altered state, meditation, and the
     problematization of personal control-power in light of the part/whole
     (self/ground) relationship in the dissociative cognitive state? 

discussion
of various questions -- oct. 6, 2007.
questions covered:

why bother spreading the
     truth about the nature of religion and religious origins?
how does the establishment
     treatment of topics shut-out coverage of entheogens in religious history?
what is the way forward so
     that the mainstream culture integrates the maximal entheogen theory of
     religion?
what evidence and arguments
     are there that the original christians used drugs?
discuss the assertion
     "there's no need to assume drugs in primitive christianity."
to what extent were drugs
     used in the history of christian practice?
is new testament christianity
     more important than purely mystical christianity, because of including a
     political vector on the mystical insights?
are john pilch, jonanda groenewald, marcus borg, john ashton, and stevan davies on the right track? can they be
     converted from their standard academic "alien social-psychology"
     theory of "alternate states of consciousness" to the simpler
     drug-use theory?
how was wasson (or allegro)
     great? how did he limit or cripple the field? 
what will be retained of
     wasson (or allegro)? what will be rejected?
why bother setting the record
     straight on the errors of wasson and the merit of some of allegro's ideas?

passage). uploaded july 24, 2007. compare to the visual art of alex grey.



entheos journal
entheos is a good journal focused
on the use of entheogens throughout religious history.  the editor replied to me:
sep. 17, 2006 --
"we're still printing issue #4 (soma 2 of 2 [vol.2:no.2]).  we've got all of the remaining 6 planned
out.  the plan is to do 10 issues total.  issues #5 & #6 are co-edited by
strassman, and are ready for initial production."
oct. 4, 2006 --
"the idea is to keep the back issues in print and sell them both wholesale
and retail.  after issue #4 is out, we'll
focus on the site and web commerce/.pdf sales. as it is, i've got 100 copies each
of issues #1 & #2 at the bindery (retail $25, wholesale ~$15 [depending on
quantity]). i'm printing issue #4 before doing another run of issue #3."
