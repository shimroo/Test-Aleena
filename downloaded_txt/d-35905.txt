our behavioral health services 










 







children and family services 
childhood mental or behavioral health issues can cause a child to struggle at home, at school, and throughout their life, if untreated. such issues are not isolated – they impact the whole family. we provide trauma-informed programs and support services to help families to better understand and cope with these issues. 














 







 teen and young adult services 
the transition from adolescence to early adulthood can be turbulent and lead to complications with self-esteem, mental health, and even substance abuse. our trauma-informed therapy and counseling services are available either in-person or through telehealth. we encourage you to reach out to us at any time to get the help you need. 














 







adult mental health services 
ensuring adults have access to trauma-informed behavioral health services can improve their quality of life, their relationships, and allow them to maintain a positive outlook for themselves. helping those around us on their mental health journey is the foundation of a strong community.  














 







adult substance use services 
we provide individualized and comprehensive substance use treatments for those desiring recovery from drug or alcohol addiction or abuse. our compassionate professionals and peer support specialists are here to guide and support individuals every step of the way. we also offer medication management services. 














 







senior services 
aging and retirement can be a challenging transition for seniors. we provide behavioral health services to address those challenges and help them make the most of those pivotal years.
