welcome fellow traveler!if you've found your way to my website, i think you are already a wise person. rumi expresses it this way: "yesterday i was clever, so i wanted to change the world. today i am wise, so i am changing myself."the world is undergoing massive transformation. most of us have a long list of improvements we'd like to see. however, i salute you for taking time to focus on whatever you'd like to change about yourself, because i believe your efforts can help not only you, but everyone.at your leisure, i invite you to explore my website and check out my areas of expertise (below). if you resonate with my work, and if your worldview and actions arise from heartfelt compassion, feel free to contact me to arrange a consultation. â€”cat saunders, ph.d.
