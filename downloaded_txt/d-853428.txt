quit meth now!










 

























the  cure to drug addiction lies within the understanding of how the body and mind  are simultaneously influenced by a chemical dependency problem. only after  gaining this knowledge can the addict start the process of reversing the  addiction cycle, and begin to address the triggers in the mind which are  keeping him addicted. this is the world's first and only absolutely anonymous  drug treatment program in the form of literature, as users do not have to show  up, sign in, sit through any classes, and nobody will ever know they are using  a program unless they decide to tell someone themselves. for the average user,  anonymity and the high price of in-house drug treatment programs are some of the  main reasons for not seeking help. this literature takes away those excuses and  puts the program into the user's hands for the price of a book, something that  has never been offered to them in the past. this is a full-service drug  treatment program, which tackles the psychological aspects of addiction and  teaches the user how to use several different mind-game techniques to recognize  and reverse these triggers of convenience, which often lead to addiction and  relapse. any addict, who reads the entire content of this book, and uses the  techniques when and how they are described, will be drug-free by the time they finish  this book. in the past, this feat was deemed impossible, but how to quit meth now brings new hope  to a generation of addicts often viewed as hopeless.

â â â â â â â â â â â  
          this  book is broken down into 28 chapters and two phases, split almost down the  middle, as the second phase begins midway through the literature. the first  half of the book is dedicated to teaching the user why he is addicted to  cocaine, and how he can reverse the process by changing the way he thinks,  while planning an exit strategy to his addiction. the reader is taught how to  work towards a 'quit-date' and is instructed not to read any of the second  phase until this quit date has arrived. once the reader quits using for a full  24 hours, he starts reading on the second phase of the program. 
          

â â â â â â â â â â â  
          the  second half of the book teaches the user how to use a 14-day self-detox program  in the privacy of one's home, while being instructed on how to pull off this  feat with the help of several over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, vitamins, and  herbs, with a play-by-play of what to expect and how to react to the physical  and physiological withdrawals, on a day to day basis. the reader has 14  different chapters to follow at this point, one for each day of the detox  period. this is important information since every day after the initial detox  ravages the body and psyche of the addict, trying to convince them to relapse. the  techniques described in this literature addresses and attacks the daily changes  in the human body and mind during the processes of withdrawal, which change each  day, after the chemical has been removed from the daily regimen. 
          

â â â â â â â â â â â  
          this  book is written as a one-on-one conversation with the addict, from an ex-addict  who has already been through all of the trials and tribulations of kicking the  same addiction successfully, with this same program. the author talks directly  to the one person who is reading and gains their understanding, friendship, and  trust, while we they take this ride together. the reader is always well  informed as to what is coming next, and well aware that all of the bumps in the  road have already been addressed. gaining the readers trust is the  physiological advantage of any successful drug treatment program. this book  goes far beyond gaining the trust and confidence of the reader/addict seeking  help.

      chapter 1 - 
    an introduction



     if you don't already believe in destiny then i strongly urge you to reconsider. in
        your life there are certain discernible chains of events that cannot be discounted
        as mere coincidence. for the sake of argument there are two distinctive forms of
        destiny: that which you make happen and that which happens to you. it's easy to
        speculate in hindsight and determine that given your own personal set of
        circumstances, you were destined to become a drug addict. it happened to you.
        notwithstanding the fact that had you known you would end up an addict, you
        may have considered altering your path in the early steps of drug
        experimentation, it still happened. now it's time for you to decide if you are
        destined to become an ex-drug addict. this is the kind of destiny that you make
        happen, however true destiny lies at the intersection of both what you make
        happen and what happens to you.
             in the early 80's, a local rock radio station, kmet in los angeles, was
        hosting an april fools' morning party at the palace, which is directly across the
        street from the famous capital records building in hollywood, california. i
        showed up at the building as one of 300 or so contestants in a "fools" contest
        because the grand prize was a vip package that included meeting rock hero
        sammy hagar just before he took the stage at the forum supporting his three-
        lock-box tour. i showed up with this great idea of wearing a t-shirt that said et,
        the extra testicle and had pink balloons protruding from my shorts. to make a
        long story short, i won the contest and cheech and chong stole my bit and put it
        in their next movie called still smokin. cheech had the same design on his shirt
        and proclaimed "et, the extra testicle" just like i had done. maybe you've seen
        itâ¦the film made over 15 million dollars and i never made a cent and never got
        credit.
             anyway, i had always dreamed of being a rock singer and the thought of
        meeting one of my two favorites (still haven't met ted nugent) had easily made


this one of the best days of my life to that point. the palace was a huge venue
      and i had just "performed" for well over 2000 people and emerged victorious as
      the crowd favorite. remember it was a fool's contest.
           as the four-hour party was nearing the end, my friends and i were heading
      towards the front door and i stopped and turned around because i felt an
      intensely overpowering urge to look at the stage one last time. at that point i
      knew destiny was going to play a part in my life whether i liked it or not. one of
      my friends yelled out at me because i was holding them up. "jay, what the hell
      are you doing?" he said. i remember my answer as if it were yesterday. "i'm
      looking at the stage one last time, i yelled. "i just got a strong feeling that the next
      time i see it, i'll be on that stage singing with a band." two of my friends snapped
      in unison, "you don't even have a band," they laughed.
           well, over the years i had told that story to a lot of people and as time
      worked against me the palace was eventually closed down and boarded up. i
      did put together a couple of bands and eventually i helped form a band called
      kill-era that held together for almost five years and had started to make a pretty
      good impact in the hard-to-crack la music scene. we were making a name for
      ourselves by opening for major bands as they toured the club scenes across the
      nation and ended up in the la or orange county areas. we had worked our way
      up to the prime-time position with the national act going on after we finished
      around midnight. we had opened for so many headliners including armored
      saint, pantera, corrosion of conformity, wrathchild america, nuclear assault,
      flotsam & jetsam, excel, death angel, lizzy borden and exodus to name a few.
      without our knowledge, somebody had bought up the old palace and
      completely remodeled it. we had just played a show with pantera opening for
      them on their "cowboy's from hell" tour three months before i got the call and i
      couldn't believe it. we were opening for pantera again at the grand re-opening of
      the newly renovated hollywood palace.
           it was a sold out show and everywhere you looked there was somebody
      you knew from the pages of who's who in the music or movie industry.


page 1
page 2



      pantera treated us like vip's and even paid our bar tab for the night. our show was at its
peak and the audience acted as if we were the headliners. destiny realized!
some nine years later my vision had become a reality. i know that had i
not formed a band and positioned myself for the call it wouldn't have happened
but divine intervention linked together all of the ifs ands or buts. if it were a mere
coincidence, then why was i forewarned? would-of, could-of and should-of didn't
have a chance.
     to this day, opening for pantera at the palace was the best day of my
life. it was also the last show i ever did without meth in my system. the
downward spiral was hastened by my bass player marc getting fronted two
ounces a week and within a year the band had broken up completely. we played
our last show at the hop in anaheim, ca with flotsam and jetsam and after
marc showed up 20 minutes after our starting time, the promoter was so mad he
made us set up on the floor in front of the stage.
     meth had infested the band members and had eventually made it
impossible for us to function as a unit. naturally, it wasn't too long before meth
made it impossible for me to function as an individual. i lost everything, just like
people had said i would. my house, my car, my wife, my dignity, my
prideâ¦somebody stop me!
     you can finish the story from here. at this point we all went through the
same things exactly. when people say different people react differently, don't you
believe it. we all act the same on meth and we all do the same things. only
genetic personality traits sometimes make it appear different but it's all the same,
believe me. we're all screwed.
     drug addiction is a death wish, straight up. when casual use evolves to
chemical dependency, the daily torture of self-medication comes with a somber
will to reach an end sooner as opposed to later. one day you realize the only
thing that can save your life is quitting altogether. so you think about the big
question: do i really have anything to live for? without clear motivation,
attempting to quit will never become anything more then an attempt. you must
define your motivation. you have to know why you want to quit.


page 3
page 4


     when i was ready to quit, i looked everywhere for help. with the exception
of programs i couldn't afford, there really was no help. there was little or no help
in the library and the internet was so crammed with unreliable nonsense that it
was at best, humorous. i remember the first time i turned to a computer for help
and i typed in the word "meth." i got something like 120,000 hits with the number
one position entitled "how to manufacture methamphetamine and several other
drugs." it was a dead end. the only thing other than that were several sites
offering horror stories of meth addiction i was already familiar with from my own
personal experiences.
     i couldn't believe it. with all of the progressions of our country and the
world, nobody was offering a solution for drug addiction. then i heard that voice
in my head again. i decided that somebody had to make available a drug
dependency solution for the general public and that somebody was going to be
me. i would do it. i would clean up and i would spend all of my time researching
existing drug treatment methods and talking with drug addicts who had already
kicked the habit on their own and we would develop our own methods.
i believe that one man can make a difference. i know i can and i know
that you can. with the help of my friends i have developed the perfect drug
treatment program. i designed the web sites and i wrote every word of its
content. now, it's time to write the book. this will be a self-help manual that
guides the addict through a step-by-step detoxification and offers real and usable
techniques for staying sober. shamefully, i am the best man for the job and lucky
for you, it is my destiny.

      chapter 2 - 
  genesis


     welcome to the show. you're here today because your quest to kick a drug
      addiction has led you to this book. you've said the magic words that often lead to
      a drug free lifestyle, "i need help." the three words every drug addict uses after
      realizing their casual use has now blossomed into a chemical dependency
      problem. the question isâ¦are you ready to quit? is kicking your drug addiction
      the single most important issue in your life right now? if the answer is no, close
      the book now and come back to it when you're ready. it's no big deal, right?
      this is where we weed out the weaklings. being a drug addict is the
      easiest thing that anybody can ever do. it requires no effort at all and
      supplies you with all of the necessary excuses to be a failure.
           this is the beginning of a very long and drawn out book that will take you
      on a journey through every aspect of your addiction. it will help you understand
      how and why you became an addict and eventually supply you with everything
      you need to know to take away all of the excuses you require to stay addicted. in
      this book you'll learn how to detox your body from your drug and together we'll
      identify and address all of the triggers in your mind that are keeping you
      addicted. if you've decided you want to be drug free, you'll have to read every
      word of this book. that's a huge commitment for an addict and you'll need to
      understand there are several different levels of want in, "i want to quit." you have
      to want to quit more then you've ever wanted anything before in your life.
      i'm not funded by any organization or government grant or by any person
      at all. unlike other drug treatment programs, i will not lie to you. if i thought that
      cutting off your arm would help you quit using, i would tell you so. as you may
      already know, things are going to get a lot worse before they get any better.
      kicking a drug addiction is hard work and you have to be strong. it's understood
      that most people who experiment with drugs are not interested in a drug
    treatment program and in fact assume they're not even addicted. you can
understand this as you've felt this way yourself in the past. it's a common belief
      that drugs are for recreational use only and can lead to addiction if you don't
      monitor yourself wisely. i guess you failed that test because you're now suffering
      from a chemical dependency.
     the main difference between drug use and a chemical dependency is
      addiction. addiction occurs over a period of time when the initial effects of the
      drug are diminished by the human body's own ability to build up a tolerance for
      such things as alcohol and drugs. as the body's tolerance level climbs, it requires
      a larger dose of the drug to reach your intended high. as you raise the quantity of
      drug consumption, you begin to put toxic levels of the drug into your bloodstream
      which eventually changes your body's own chemistry. after continued and
      uninterrupted use, your body adapts to the chemical as if it were intended to
      operate with it in your system.
           the problem is when you attempt to take the chemical away your body
      can no longer function without it. it's now dependent on that chemical to function
      normally or in a normal state. it's this chemical dependency that's keeping you
      addicted. the cycle is clear. if you try to take the drug away while you're
      chemically dependent, you'll suffer from withdrawal symptoms. this is your body
      now trying to function without the drug. the shock to your central nervous system
      is just as drastic as when you first introduced your body to the drug. everything
      you think and feel is completely different from feeling normal. that's what
      withdrawal means. you are withdrawing a chemical that your body now needs to
      function normally. most likely you've felt these withdrawal symptoms yourself in
      the past, as this is the biggest part of addiction. quitting becomes a horrible
      experience with an easy solution: take your medicine and the pain will go away.
      so what now? now, you need a program to help you clean up and get a
      grip on your chemical dependency. there's nothing to be ashamed of as
      everybody who kicks a drug addiction followed a program. even someone who
      quits on their own has put themselves on some kind of program. decisions were
    made and steps were taken to quit, once and for all.

     there are really only three ways you can kick a drug addiction. one is in
      jail, where large doses of the drug are not available. another is in an expensive
      drug treatment facility where all they're really doing is locking you in a room (just
      like jail) and the third is to quit on your own. quitting on your own is the most
      common of the three and it's also the hardest because you know where you can
      easily get some of your drug. quitting in a lockdown treatment center or jail is
      easy because you have no choice. that's where the statement "you wanted to
      get caught" comes from. when you're living in an altered state of consciousness,
      sometimes your subconscious has to take control of your life. the vicious drug
      cycle was killing your body off slowly but surely and your subconscious mind had
      to do something drastic or your body would deteriorate to the point where it might
      not be able to help the brain with its drug quest for much longer.
           if your body couldn't supply your brain with any more drugs, your brain
      would also be suffering the consequences. so your brain set you up with this
      simple strategy: do something stupid that will get you caught and locked up, be
      forced to rehab, rejuvenate your body and get healthy. then, get out of jail and
      start the vicious cycle again. call it a relapse if you want to but your brain never
      intended to let you quit anyway. this program will teach you to get a grip on how
      your brain is manipulating you into being a drug addict so that you can use this
      information to quit altogether. so, where do we start?
      the cure for drug addiction lies within the understanding of how the
      body and mind are simultaneously influenced by a chemical dependency.
      only after gaining this understanding can you put an end to this dependency
      altogether. in order to solve the puzzle of you own personal drug addiction, you
      must first take a few steps backwards and try to understand exactly who and
      what you are.
           as a human being, you're a consumer. your body works in conjunction
      with your brain to achieve its primary goal of being content. therefore the body's
      actions must satisfy the brain. as you know, we eat food and drink liquids to
      supply our body with the necessary supplements to maintain a healthy lifestyle
    so that we can live a long life. in this process, our brain and body work as a team


page 9
page 10


and tend to trust each other's instincts unequivocally. when the body is tired, the
      brain sends us signals and we begin the process of shutting down and getting
      the necessary rest required to function for the next waking period. when the
      body is lacking a necessary supplement, the brain figures out what's needed and
      uses the body to acquire that element. for instance, if your body was lacking a
      proper supply of vitamin c, the brain might send the body to the store to get an
      orange, or at least that's how it's supposed to work.
           unfortunately, we've entered an age where the orange example has
      become obsolete. now, if your body required vitamin c, your brain can simply
      send you to the kitchen cupboard to take a multi-vitamin. if the brain is not feeling
      up to par, it doesn't have to figure out what combination of foods and liquids
      would relieve the problem. it would just instruct you to take a pill. an aspirin or a
      cold pill could be a chemical quick fix to a biological problem. can you see where
      i'm going with this?
           with the introduction of chemicals into our bodies in pill form, we have not
      only figured out how to relieve our illnesses faster and more efficiently but we've
      also built up a higher level of trust between our body and our mind. it's this
      degree of trust that's made it so easy for your brain to trick you into your current
      addiction. the big problem is this; your brain cannot be trusted. your brain has
      become the equivalent of an easily spoiled and selfish little kid who knows how to
      manipulate every aspect of your life and uses its powers to satisfy its own urges
      without regard to the ramifications of its actions. if given the opportunity, your
      brain would screw your whole life up if it could reach its primary goal of being
      content for today.
           remember the old cartoon character named wimpy from the popeye
      cartoons? he always walked around telling people, "i would gladly pay you
      tuesday for a hamburger today." your brain works on the same principals of,
      "what have you done for me lately?" in the drug world, wimpy would simply be
      asking for a front. "i would gladly pay you later for something to get me high right
      now," he'd say. his statement was nothing short of the brain trying to figure out
    how to spend money he didn't even have yet. as we all learned, it's a lot easier to
picture having money tomorrow then it is to actually acquire it after the fact. later
      in this course, you'll learn how to gain control of your mind by breaking this link of
      trust and once again start making decisions that are productive for your entire
      well-being.
     drug addiction is not a disease. just ask anyone who has ever tried to
      kick lung cancer. as an addict you have options that simply aren't available to
      someone suffering from a serious illness. you can quit. you can keep on
      believing you're a slave to your drug addiction, that there is no hope, you'll
      always be a failure or...you can quit. people who believe that drug addiction is a
      disease are simply at the end of their rope trying to understand why they or
      somebody they know is still suffering from a drug addiction. when all means of
      understanding and treatment have been exhausted the only valid explanation
      remaining is that the user is just another victim of a serious illness that's out of
      their hands. believe me, the last thing you need is another excuse to be
      addicted, such as you having a disease. if you've already bought into this
      myth, than your treatment will start the day you realize you're not a victim
      of a drug addiction but yet another willing participant. if nothing else, you
      should be thankful that you don't have an incurable disease. also, you should
      always be skeptical when you hear ridiculous statements that simply don't make
      sense.
           there's a lot of government funding out there that's targeted for any study
      or program that has anything to do with the general public figuring out what's
      going wrong in the drug treatment industry. people who have never been
      addicted to drugs don't understand how addiction works and rightfully blame the
      rise in crime and violence on the drug problem. when the public cries out,
      government programs are funded and a different type of crime begins. i'm
      referring to what i like to call educated welfare, where people who have six-year
      college degrees spend their time creating studies to collect government funding
      instead of finding real jobs that would actually benefit society. because they call
    themselves scientists their conclusions are seldom questioned and their


page 11
page 12



credibility is enhanced just enough to make them eligible for yet another
      government grant.
           that's where the statement, "drug addiction is a disease" came from.
      scientific rhetoric wasn't paying the bills anymore so a conclusion had to be
      made. the true answer of, "we have no idea why someone gets addicted to
      drugs" wouldn't fly. lucky for you, we've figured out why you're addicted and i'll
      explain it to you so you can understand it and kick your addiction once and for all.
     this program is designed as a self-help drug treatment program for
      people who are currently fighting with a methamphetamine or cocaine
      addiction. although there are significant differences between cocaine and
      methamphetamine, the treatment methods necessary for kicking these
      addictions are virtually identical. unlike heroin, which is made from opium,
      cocaine and meth are both from the speed family and have the same effects on
      the body and the mind. besides, they already have a detox program for heroin,
      its called methadone.
           methadone is a synthetic drug that was developed with the intention of
      making the pharmaceutical industry richer by offering heroin addicts an
      expensive alternative to heroin so they could detox from their addicted drug
      without the consequence of withdrawal symptoms. the problem with methadone
      is that the addict quickly finds out he can't live without his daily dose of
      methadone and the cycle of addiction has only found a new course. luckily
      though, the drug profits have been taken out of the hands of the illegal street
      dealers and put into the hands of our legal drug dealers, our ever-powerful
      pharmaceutical companies. while the trade off seems bittersweet, the goal of
      detoxification can be a reality and definitely qualifies as a victory in the lessor-oftwo-
      evils argument.
           in this program, we'll attempt to utilize the methadone game plan by
      mimicking the effects of your drug using several over-the-counter
      pharmaceuticals, vitamins and herbs to try to relieve the craving for your drug
      while at the same time detoxing the body and mind from the chemical
    dependency. this along with the attempt to minimize all withdrawal symptoms


page 13
page 14


will make this the perfect program for anyone who's seriously seeking an
      effective self-help detox program.
           this is a 2-phase, 3-step program that starts in the heat of addiction. it
      guides the current user through a 14-day, self-detoxification period while
      employing simple psychological techniques for helping the addict to stay clean
      forever by learning how to understand the triggers in the mind that often cause a
      clean addict to relapse.
           trigger is the word we use to describe the action that takes place in your
      mind that causes you to use or relapse after you've been clean for any period of
      time. it's the realization that certain triggers exist in you that's caused you to
      figure out that you're addicted to this drug in the first place. what i mean by this
      is that while there was a time when you believed you could take it or leave it,
      you've since learned about the forces inside your mind that are working against
      you. at some point you wanted to quit but were unable to because every time
      you tried, something in your head would take control of you and make you want
      the drug so bad you would do anything you could to get it. the longer you waited
      after deciding you were going to get your drug, the harder it became to wait
      patiently.
           that's when you said to yourself for the first time, "i guess i am a drug
      addict." after that it became easier for your brain to control you because you had
      already thrown in the towel and decided you could handle the label "drug addict."
      after that, every time you tried to quit, your brain played on your addiction and
      used one of several different techniques to "trigger" you back into getting the
      drug again.
           there are many different triggers in your brain that you'll have to identify
      before you can beat your drug addiction altogether and i'll teach you how to spot
      them and gain control over them. understanding how the triggers in your
      mind are manipulating you softens the attempt and eventually teaches you
      how to overcome the temptation altogether. i'll teach you how to use some
      simple mind techniques for overcoming your addiction. they're as simple as they
      are effective.

    chapter 3 - the program


     a good drug treatment program requires the implementation of several
      predetermined systems and methods. just as your drug use has now taken
      the form of a daily ritual, your exit from the drug world must also be
      somewhat ritualistic. to achieve your ultimate goal of living a drug-free lifestyle,
      you must follow a system of using several different step-by-step procedures
      simultaneously. that's why we call it a program. to link all of our actions to a
      term that best describes our course of action. the goal then will be to find the
      right program for you: the program that works. the problem with most drug
      treatment programs is they're either completely ineffective or they cater to the
      rich and are out of reach to the average addict. the trick than involves how you
      not only find a program that works but also one you can afford.
     welcome to the world's first and only anonymous drug treatment
      program! you don't have to show up, sign in or talk to anybody about your
      addiction and nobody will ever know you followed a program unless you decide
      at some point that you want them to know. it's absolutely anonymous and
      controlled by you alone. this is the most effective drug treatment program you'll
      ever find and if you're reading this right now, you've already figured out the cost.
      i am one of the world's self-proclaimed leading experts on meth addiction
      and treatment. i consider myself an expert because i've been a meth addict for
      many years in the past and i know exactly what it feels like to be addictedâ¦and i
      know how to kick the addiction and i also know how to teach you to kick your
      own addiction. i firmly believe that you cannot teach a meth addict how to kick a
      meth addiction if you've never experienced meth addiction first hand. how can
      you be counseled through your addiction by someone who doesn't even
      understand what it is that you actually think and feel? i believe that the main
      problem with most existing drug treatment programs is they use counselors that
    have never been addicted to the drug you're trying to kick. you can't be cured or
lectured or even counseled by someone who doesn't completely understand
      what you're going through. i do know how you feel right now. i've been there. i
      have walked in your shoes exactly, i have thought the way you now think and i've
      felt the pain and agony that you feelâ¦and i know what it takes to reverse the
      process and kick this addiction. i will explain all of that to you but i want to get
      something out of the way first.
           this book is being written as a self-help guide for kicking your
      methamphetamine or cocaine addiction. as i've already mentioned, the treatment
      for both of these drugs is virtually identical although the drugs are obviously
      different by nature. i believe that meth is harder to kick than cocaine but that's
      just my opinion because i've never been a cocaine addict. when addicted to
      meth, sometimes cocaine just comes off as a weak form of speed that hardly
      even stimulates the nerve endings. i did become addicted to methamphetamine
      quite easily and i do understand that cocaine addicts are just as screwed as
      meth addicts as they are completely chemically dependent, just to a slightly
      different chemical. that said, i will no longer generalize by using the word "drug"
      when i'm referring to meth. if you're using this program to kick a cocaine
      addiction, simply replace the word "meth" with the word "cocaine" every time you
      read it and you'll be fine. there are many reasons why i'm doing this and the
      program will work perfectly for any cocaine addict who is ready to quit and who
      follows these guidelines.
           for these and other reasons, this is now specifically a meth program to
      help you kick your methamphetamine addiction. i am your host and guide and
      you are exactly where you need to be right now. i honestly believe that anyone
      who makes it through this entire program, who becomes a recovered addict, will
      also be able to qualify someday as a meth addiction and treatment expert.
      currently you're just another addict seeking a cure but lucky for you, you've come
      to the right place.
           the program you're going to be using here is called the quitmeth
      program. i personally developed the quitmeth program for the website
    quitmeth.com and quitcocaine.com. it currently sells for $300 over the internet


page 17
page 18



and is a multimedia program that includes a 40 minute video, an 8 cassette tape
      audio program, a pamphlet with several different topics and many other items
      that i will talk about later in this book, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins
      and other products. the quitmeth program has sold in almost every state in the
      u.s. as well as several meth-infected countries around the globe. as of the
      writing of this book, the program has an unprecedented 100% effective rate. that
      means everyone who purchased this program for $300 over the internet
      successfully completed it if they started it. i base this on the fact that nobody has
      ever asked for a refund or even sent an email saying a single negative word
      about the package they received. i also base it on the countless flow of emails
      praising the program and thanking the quitmeth site for helping them kick their
      meth addiction or for just plain saving their life. have you ever heard of a 100%
      effective meth treatment program? that's impossible, right? i agree it makes no
      sense. how can someone with no medical, legal or psychological training come
      up with a program that actually works? i believe there are two primary reasons
      for this accomplishment.
           first, this program was designed for the addict who is still using meth daily
      and can't figure out how to quit. besides quitmeth, there are no other drugtreatment
      programs in the world today that actually help you detox in the privacy
      of your own home, on your own time. there are none that use over-the-counter
      pharmaceuticals, vitamins and herbs as tools to help you quit: this is the only
      one. this is a self-help program that teaches you how to prepare for your exit out
      of the drug world and tells you when and how to quit.
           the second reason is a bit harder to grasp. i believe that charging $300
      for the program was the catch-22 that made it successful. if you wanted to quit
      bad enough to pay $300 for the program than the systems and methods provided
      would work for you. if you didn't think that paying $300 was worth finding out if
      the program would work, than it probably wouldn't work because your intent was
      really not to quit anyway but maybe to convince yourself that you're too addicted
      and had looked everywhere for help. i know this because i have done extensive
    testing and reevaluating and changed many factors of the program before it was


page 19
page 20


perfected. this final program is a full 10-year production and these techniques
      are tried and true. i had given it away for free and had varied the price to see
      what effects it would have. the average meth addict is not ready or willing to quit.
      giving away the program for free could not accurately account for its
      effectiveness.
           now the big problem in writing this book along with my intentions of giving
      the program away for free was to figure out how i could bridge this gap. how can
      i convince a meth addict that this is the best program and only program that will
      help them if i seriously believed one of the main reasons the quitmeth program
      was so effective was because it involved the user buying the program for $300?
      if getting the addict to spend their own money on the cure was a successful
      component, how can i get the same results while in effect, removing this key
      ingredient?
           well, i finally figured that out too. the secret would have to be hidden in
      the content. the book would have to be written in a way that would make it so
      that anybody who read the entire content cover-to-cover and followed the steps
      provided would be unable to continue to convince themselves that they're still
      addicted to meth and that the power to quit was something they did not possess.
      i now believe that you can no longer be addicted to meth if you know you can
      quit and if you know how to quit. if you know how to quit and you know a great
      program that has worked for thousands of people just like you, you can no longer
      blame addiction or the possibility that you have a disease as the reason that you
      are a meth user. if you know how to quit and you choose not to, you're not really
      interested in quitting. this book must take away the need for the addict to spend
      his own money on the course itself, so that he can concentrate on the
      adaptations and requirements of the lesson. so now, i believe that the
      requirement is no longer a factor and that the book itself is the cure. the cure for
      meth addiction is the content and execution of the program in this book. no
    more, no less.
     if you want to clean up and you want the help you deserve, it's all here. if
      you choose to be a non-recovering addict and you believe you can live with that,
      maybe that's who you are. maybe that is your destiny.
      i will give you this guarantee right here, right now. if you read this book
      from beginning to end and follow all of the instructions, you'll be meth free
      by the time you close the back cover. i guarantee it. these are big words that
      nobody has ever said to you and i know that. so what makes me so confident?
      what gives me the right to give you this guarantee? why do i have the audacity
      to make this impossible statement that no other drug treatment program would
      ever dare say let alone put in writing? am i crazy? who the hell do i think i am
      and what makes me so different?
           i am hope and i am the truth and i am the answer. those are the three
      things i was searching for while i was trying to figure out how i was going to kick
      my own meth addiction. i wanted someone or something to prove to me there
      was hope and i just wanted someone to tell me the god's honest truth and i
      wanted answers to all of my questions. no more lies and please, no more con
      jobs. while doing my own research as i was looking for answers, i searched
      through all sources available at the time. as i mention on the quitmeth site, this
      program is the culmination of several years of research including existing drug
      treatment methods, department of justice studies, d.e.a studies and interviews
      with drug addicts both on the streets and in the system. when i found the real
      answers i found out the truth and when i learned the truth i finally found hope.
           the single greatest truth about meth addiction is very simple. nobody can
      help you unless you're willing to help yourself. nobody really cares about you
      because you've already burned every bridge of substance in your life. not even
      god can help you if you're not ready and willing to step up and help yourself. if
      you're ready, i'll teach you how. trust me now and i'll not let you down. i'm a
      meth addict who is now clean and knows why. i am hope, i am the truth and i am
    the answer.
