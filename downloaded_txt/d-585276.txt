wedding at the beach club
“i can’t say enough, what an amazing job d’amico catering did in helping us plan our wedding and reception. they never told me “no” – but they always offered suggestions to meet our needs. the event manager met with us several times to ensure we had every detail covered. the space is absolutely beautiful and i fell in love with it the moment i walked in the door…the food was amazing!…thank you for making our wedding day so special!”.

professional. personal. informative. top of the list.
“katie is the perfect combination of being professional and personal; informative about details, but staying focused on the whole of the experience we were trying to create.  she always had helpful ideas and options when we asked her advice, yet i felt that we were in charge of creating the evening.  i felt supported all along the way.  i have high praise for all elements of the service that d’amico provides, and katie is at the top of the list.  thank you!”
