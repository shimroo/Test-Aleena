"great holiday experience"

if you are looking for a relaxed place to stay and enjoy your holiday in and around knysna then pezula resort hotel & spa is the place to go to. the staff members are friendly and helpful as well. the activities desk also provides information on activities to do in the surrounding areas.
- gugup2016 "absolutely loved this place"
my room was spacious and opulent, i had candles in the bathroom and the most cosy, fluffy and comfy gowns. the breakfast spread was yummy and satisfying. tamsin and kgomotso at the spa were so outstanding, best massage ever, you can tell they love what they do. canâ€™t wait to go back.
- shadi m"impressive hotel"
pezula resort hotel & spa under new management is maintaining high standards and providing great guest accommodations. the rooms are large and luxurious. the breakfast buffet is top-notch. isolated from knysna in the hills, the pezula provides a true resort environment, yet the town is a short drive away.
