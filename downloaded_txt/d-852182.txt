history 
 the  south   african aids vaccine initiative (saavi) was established in 1999 as an    initiative of the south african government and managed as a lead   programme of  the south african medical  research council (samrc). saaviâs role was to co-ordinate and  support the development   and testing of hiv vaccines in south africa with the  aim of finding an   affordable, effective and locally relevant hiv vaccine. 
 saavi  was initially funded through grants from the south african   departments of health  and science & technology, eskom, the impala   platinum community development  trust, transnet and the european   commission. 
 










much was achieved by saavi over a period of 14 years, including inter alia:


establishment of a network of expertise in hiv vaccine development, testing, community engagement, socio-behavioural and ethical issues


improved  understanding of hiv diversity, immunology and prevalence in relation to the  south african epidemic


the development,  preclinical and clinical (phase 1) testing of 2 hiv subtype c vaccine  candidates


the establishment  and accreditation of a glp laboratory for potency testing of vaccine candidates


the capacitation  of 5 hiv vaccine clinical trial sites


the development of  ethical guidelines for hiv vaccine clinical trials


substantial  engagement with, and preparation of, communities for hiv vaccine clinical  trials


capacity    development of researchers and technicians in hiv vaccine development,   testing,  community engagement, socio-behavioural and ethical issues.


saavi    has continued to receive dedicated funding from the national   department of  health (ndoh) and, since 2009, the italian ministry of   foreign affairs,  directorate general of development cooperation   (mae-dgcs) for its role in the  âprogram to support the ministry of   health of south africa in the  implementation of a national program of   global response to hiv & aidsâ, a  joint development cooperation   between the governments of italy and south  africa. the program was   implemented by the national institute of health of  italy (istituto superiore di  sanitaâ or iss) in cooperation with the south african ndoh, supported by  saavi.
