hello. my name is walter baron. i run the one-man boat shop you see on these web pages. i build boats using wood as the main structural material, one at a time, in my shop in wellfleet, massachusetts, on cape cod. 



                                             some news about the old wharf                                                                           i am now, 7/15/24, 76 years old, and i am not as strong and energetic as i was a few years ago. so i am changing direction a bit, going towards smaller, lighter boats. i will no longer be building lumber yard skiffs as the parts have become too heavy and awkward for me to lift and position by myself. prams, light skiffs, glued ply lapstrake, kit boats, ultra light (skin on frame) boats will be the kind of project i will be looking for in the next few years. so if you are looking for a custom dinghy for your yacht or  a super light fishing boat to carry into that remote pond, or you are just old like me, give me a call or email to discuss the possibilities.



using techniques ranging from traditional lapstrake to plywood on frame to modern plywood/epoxy/fabric composite construction, i can build a boat suited to your particular needs.most of my boats are based on traditional designs that have stood the test of time and sea. they are not the fastest or glossiest boats on the waterfront. they are comfortable and efficient, gaining character and patina with use, age, and care.in this age of rising fuel costs i would like to emphasize the advantages of wood boats. most wood boats, especially those built with modern composite wood-epoxy-fiberglass construction, are much lighter than grp (glass-reinforced plastic) boats. this means that a boat of a given size can be powered with a smaller motor to produce the same performance. there are many designs, both traditional and modern, that fall into this category.another advantage of wood boats is that the main structural material, wood, is a renewable resource. trees still grow, unlike oil, which is a finite resource . the use of nonrenewable materials, such as epoxy adhesives and coatings add to the longevity of a boat and reduce maintenance. added benefits include the beauty of wood, and the increased comfort due to wood's ability to absorb vibration.i will be researching advanced methods of wood construction as they become available.recent boats built include a custom nauset marsh skiff set up for fly fishing, a swampscott dory for the son of the owner of the first swampscott that i built in 1978, norrpa, a savo 650d   finnish racing row boat designed by ruud van veelen, a cotuit skiff, and a 19' drake expedition rowing boat, designed by clint chase. since this original post i have built a sinne 610 and a savo 575, both designed by ruud van veelan, an 18' work skiff designed by me 30 years ago or so,, and a 20' lys, and am working on another nauset marsh skiff , as of october 2017. after the 2017 nms, i built another nauset marsh skiff, #4. next is a 16’ lys research vessels for woods hole.update 10/31/19- i built the 16’ lys research vessel this past winter, here’s a short slide show of the construction and the finished boat. also built this past winter and spring were another savo 650e ( for expedition) which was entered and finished the r2ak, build photos and race photos are up on the portfolio page as of 11/4/19. after the savo, i built a clc northeaster dory for clients in provincetown, who rowed the boat pretty hard all summer. photos of this build will be posted in the future. after the dory, i did some restorations-2 duck boats, a sailfish, and a swampscott dory. next up is another 16’ lys, so as you can see, i’ve been busy.  update 11/18/19- i have posted a slide show of the building of the northeaster dory on the portfolio page. starting  the next  16’ lys soon.update 3/16/20- finished the 16’ lys, finished the atlantic 17, am working on a custom 16’ power skiff designed by the customer. published a couple of slide shows on the duck boat jobs-on the portfolio page…update 11/12/21- finished the custom 16’ power skiff, built another 16’ lys for a commercial fisherman in hyannis, then started the fishing rowboat osprey. finished that in feb. 2021, then some modifications to a nauset marsh skiff, and some repairs to a deadrise 19 power boat i built many years ago. then i started the stretch gloucester gull, finished that - it went to quebec, canada! (photos on the portfolio page soon). as of now, 11/12/21, i am working on  glued lap duck trap wherry. plenty to do after this, including a strip planked stand up paddle board!update 12/14/23 - finished the duck trap wherry, finished the paddle board, did a couple of small projects, built nauset marsh skiff #5, did a couple more small projects, and am looking to start the next big one, walt simmons newfoundland trap skiff! stay tuned for that one… the wherry, paddle board, and nms are all on the portfolio page…  row, sail, or power, custom design or stock plan, contact me to discuss and build a boat suited to your particular needs. i can also build a kit boat for your if you don’t have the time or space to build something from chesapeake light craft, clint chase,  hewes & co, puuvenepiste (savo boats),a skiff from  pt watercraft, or others.lots of new info is posted on old wharf's facebook page, so click on the little f's you may see on these pages.

12/13/21- found this commentary from 120 years ago…













11/12/21new post on the portfolio page, a recent build i call the osprey. i had a request from a customer about a rowing boat for fly fishing, with a sliding seat, and provisions for fixed seat rowing for one or two. this is a difficult combination, as most sliding seat rigs are contraptions with a lot of parts sticking out , and they take up all the room in the middle of the boat. this makes a boat useless for fly fishing, and fishing in general because there is no room to stand, and in the case of fly fishing, the line would get caught on the rig in several places. also, the boat would be difficult to convert to fixed seat rowing. fortunately, i found a very nice, simple sliding seat made by gig harbor boat works that overcomes these problems. for the hull i knew i needed a flat bottom skiff for stability, so i chose john atkin’s “george” as a base. this was one of john’s last designs, and he had one built for himself . this boat has a long waterline and wide flat bottom for stability. because  i was using a sliding seat, i stretched the boat 10%, going from 16’ to 17’6”, and kept everything else the same. i lofted the boat full size, and used okoume marine ply and clear fir for the hull materials, sheathing the exterior with 6 oz. fiberglass and epoxy, and coating the interior with epoxy. i added full flotation, and storage bow and stern. the sliding seat configuration called for longitudinal bulkheads to support the rails for the seat, so i also filled the spaces between the hull and the bulkheads with foam and decked them over. the longitudinal bulkheads gave me the clear open space in the middle of the boat needed for fishing, and the rails gave  support for the fixed thwart aft. i also built a pair of 8’spruce  oars and used douglass oarlocks and martinoli sleeves to go with the sliding seat. i think the boat came out  great, and the customer is very happy. i did not get to row the boat as i finished it in the middle of the winter, and i have not been able to get to rhode island where the boat is used.  i hope to get a couple of photos of the boat in the water, and when i do i will post them here. but for now , check out the build slide show on the portfolio page.give me a call or email me if you are interested in this boat.next build was a stretch gloucester gull finished out very high end, i will post this one on the portfolio page soon.



10/21/21a new updated version of the u.s coast guard “boat builder’s handbook” was released recently - here’s the link.



8/10/21 - apple pay is now available in the boatshop store!you can pay for plans, knives, and all other items available in the store with applepay. it will come up on the checkout page automatically if you are using an apple computer, tablet, or iphone.



7/2/21- here is a link to an article on the lumber yard skiffs originally published in the paper magazine small boats 2008, now archived in the digital magazine small boats monthly. the article was featured in a regular email communication from small boats monthly, an on line magazine devoted to all kinds of small boats- row, power, and sail. check it out!!



2/4/21 - great article on the savo 650 in the latest small boats magazine! here’s a link to it, you may need a subscription to read it. i built both the savo’s they have , the original 650d, norppa, and the 650e , mursu, that they rowed in the r2ak.

6/5/20a blast from the past ! here’s a photo of me in front of my original shop on bank st. in wellfleet.it was probably taken around 1980 or so, by my wife’s cousin jane or her ex husband . her ex husband found it and sent it to her, who sent it to me. at that time i was building plywood prams, and selling 6 in the spring to the goose hummock shop in orleans. this was a pretty good order at that time, plus i also sold a few myself. i built about 50 of those prams, which i designed. 1/4” fir marine plywood of high quality was $25.00 a sheet, framing and thwarts were pine, weight was about 55 pounds. i don’t remember the price, around $150 i think. i built 2 a week, not bad money in those days.










at my original shop on bank st. in wellfleet, prams for sale…





5/8/20on  lighter note, tyler fields has finished the first part of a video he and woody metzger started over a year ago, asking several local boat builders and  marine related craftsmen 4 questions :1 -why has your business survived and where do you see it going?  2- what would you do if you weren’t doing this?  3- would you like to see your kids do this?  4- do you love your job?tyler finished the response to the first question, and here is the link to the youtube video . it was a lot of fun making this video, and i am honored to be one of the chosen craftsmen.

2/22/19some new stuff on the “onrowing” page…2/13/19



just received this comment from an lys builder- dale, from indiana:walter, thank you for such i wonderfull set of skiff plans. i grew up fishing jersey lobster and have commercially fished both east and west coasts. along with 8 years in alaska. having retired from commercial fishing 11 years ago and moving to the midwest, i still always wanted to build a skiff from scratch . well that’s done and i thank you . i get many compliments on what nice lines this simple skiff has!!! it was a wonderfull and fulfilling project! i’ve fished a lot of boats and there is just something classy about a boat with lines. so many boats built today just don’t have any. your skiff is simple but when properly built you can sit back and truly enjoy “ the lines” thanks, dale!



1/31/19next project is another savo 650d, for the same people who own the first one. this boat will be a little different, the plan is to use it for long distance expedition style rowing. so it will be reinforced in several ways - exert frames, abrasion protection, decks bow and stern for storage and flotation, etc. they have already rowed the maine island trail in the original norrpa, here is a link to a story about the row. the title is “a feast of adventure”, by leigh dorsey. also, she did an online presentation called “rowing to wild”, both very interesting. so they have some experience rowing distances, this should be an interesting boat.










the original savo 650d, norrpa, ready to row…





1/29/19-  progress on the 16’ lys-the boat is finished, and has been loaded onto the owner’s trailer and taken to her new home.

11/21/18- check out the ash coffee table i have for sale on the boats for sale page ! scroll down to the bottom.



11/8/18check out the photo album of the recently completed nauset marsh skiff. this is the 4th nms that i have built, looks pretty good. options on this boat include a casting deck with storage under, console with gas tank storage under the seat, floorboards/cable chase, and hinged aft seat. power is a 30 hp evinrude e-tec motor.























10/3/18 thanks to all who made the rendezvous a great success ! we had beautiful weather, about 15 boats including a 6 oared gig, 2 traditional banks dories, a clc northeaster dory rowed in from orleans (and back later in the afternoon!), and many more interesting boats. here’s a link to a short video on youtube, and here‘s a link to some photos on facebook. 10/11/18 - just posted another video from the rendezvous, aboard the cornish pilot gig.  it’s in several places including here on the on rowing page, the old wharf facebook page, and youtube!



8/27/18another new item in the boatshop store!i have added a 3 fathom utility/dock line to the inventory. it is made of 3/8" hempex synthetic 3-strand line, and is 18' long, with a 12" hand worked eye splice on one end, and a needle and palm whipping on the other. a nice addition to any small boat's gear.













8/7/18just got in a new batch of oarsman marine tallow  kits, for your oar leathers, and anything else that squeaks while you  row...



                                        6/11/18new item added to the boatshop store!i have added the mora clipper companion f, one of the best inexpensive knives for small boat use. read more about it, and order one here.













  4/17/18the next project is another nauset marsh skiff. i will not be documenting the build, since i just did that on the old wharf facebook page . this one will be very similar, same hull , side decks, console, but with a casting platform forward and one aft of the console. the aft one will fold up for access underneath. i will try to post some stuff from the archives, including lumber yard skiffs built from plans. meanwhile, don't forget the adirondack guide boat i have for sale . there will be a spring price reduction- check  it out!










a great looking, and great rowing boat...





10/2/17 - next project-...is building another nauset marsh skiff like the one in the slideshow above. this one will stay on the cape, the owner is from chatham. i will be posting photos of the build on the facebook page, and some here also. here's a recent photo...10/25/17- i started the build album on facebook...3/27/18- the boat is finished, and out the shop door. i brought it to a local marina for motor installation and rigging. the owner has seen the boat and is very pleased.










headed out the door...

a beautiful boat...





this year, 2017, is the 40th anniversary of old wharf dory co. i started building boats in 1977, in my yard in south wellfleet. i still have the second boat i ever built, an 8' pram designed by john gardner, from the pages of the old national fisherman. i just refinished it, a photo is below. i have built over 165 boats, ranging from 6'6" to 35'. during that time i was also a carpenter, commercial fisherman, and timber framer. be on the lookout for some special goodies to celebrate 40 years of boat building including t-shirts, hats, etc. thanks to all my customers over the years, you all have excellent taste in boats!

here's the refinished pram- exterior paint kirby green-gray, interior swedish pine tar -linseed oil.





11/11/16my next build -                is an 18' work skiff i designed around 1984 or so. it is wide and low sided, so it sits nicely on the flats at low tide, and is easy to get in and out of. the low sides also make it easy to load and unload gear, bags of shellfish, etc. this boat will replace a 30 year old boat i built in 1986. here's a link to the photo album.loa - 18'0", beam to inside planking, 7'1", beam inside at chines, 6'0", depth amidships, 1'8".1/16/17 - the 18' work skiff is finished. here's a link to the facebook album, and a photo of the finished boat-
