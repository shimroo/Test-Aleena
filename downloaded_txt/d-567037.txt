this photograph was taken from the stage using raven's konica 3200 iso ilford, supposedly its technically 1600 iso what ever, but that is as far as the dial on the camera goes so i can't say how it would turn out otherwise (the debate continues - what!!@??). i politely waited till they where inbetween songs; another photographer got up after me and obnoxiously stayed on stage, well he was press from some film festival so i guess that pass around his neck gave him that leeway - i'm still waiting to develop the other shots that i took with my cannon, which has flash which i kinda hate, i have like ten rolls yet to develop $17 each - i didn't label any of them!!!random shot because of the auto focus on my cannon rebel...i love raven's old konica its so simple to dial-in the f-stop all the buttons on these newer cameras suck - i do want to get a leica digital though ;-)

i came across this song listening to the smiths, and i had only ever heard it played at johnnie's in silverlake.  the smiths use the first two verses as an intro to rusholme ruffians, you will know what i mean if your a smiths fan, you'll recognize the beat... "marr acknowledges his musical debt to a pomus & shuman song by adapting it for this two-song medley, with marie's the name breaking into a demanding version of rusholme ruffians."a very old friend came by today'cause he was telling everyone in townof the love that he just foundand marie's the name of his latest flamehe talked and talked and i heard him saythat she had the longest blackest hairthe prettiest green eyes anywhereand marie's the name of his latest flamethough i smiled the tears inside were a-burnini wished him luck and then he said goodbyehe was gone but still his words kept returninwhat else was there for me to do but crywould you believe that yesterdaythis girl was in my arms and swore to meshe'd be mine eternallyand marie's the name of his latest flamethough i smiled the tears inside were a-burnini wished him luck and then he said goodbyehe was gone but still his words kept returninwhat else was there for me to do but crywould you believe that yesterdaythis girl was in my arms and swore to meshe'd be mine eternallyand marie's the name of his latest flameyeah marie's the name of his latest flameoh marie's the name of his latest flame.w.the smiths "rusholme ruffians" i couldn't find the one with the marie's the name medly - its on their rank album ;-)

	 cameron crowe champion of conventional assumptions and politicall corectness at the 2006 venice film festival
	 
    


apparently it's anti-american to oppose imperialism...well at least in cameron crowe's view (?)...at the press conference for receivng the award "the lion for innovation in the language of cinema"  jean-marie straub and daniele huillet sent an actor in their place to read three messages written by straub.1.  "it's come too soon for our death-too late for our life" this after all had been their first award after many years which was recounted in the second message...2. no awards since 1953: begining with a short film machorka-muff, and then 1962,1966 ... etc. in 1965 godard paid for the projection...etc. 3. the third message... besides i wouldn't be able to be festive in a festival where there are so many public and private police looking for a terrorist — i am the terrorist, and i tell you, paraphrasing franco fortini: so long as there's american imperialistic capitalism, there'll never be enough terrorists in the world.marco müller then closed the press conference without any of the actors getting a chance to say a word. straub's messages caused a furor at the festival and in the italian press — but have been virtually unreported outside of italy. was an award still in order? the jury met again. at least one jury member, american cameron crowe, objected it was not opportune, on the eve of the anniversary of 9/11, but consented on an understanding that the festival would "distance" itself from straub's "anti-american" message. (apparently it's anti-american to oppose imperialism.)three messagesfor more film links visit: king of slangmore straub/huillet in my next post:based on my notes from:political formations in the cinema of jean-marie straubby martin walsh"the radicall work of art must oppose the illusionist-mode at every levell.  the means of expression are itself called into question; because the "means of expression" are ideologically determined..."you could say illusionist = narative film, the narrative hollywood editing style - the 180 degree rule and reverse cutting... by martin walshfrom jump cut, no. 4, 1974, pp. 12-18copyright jump cut: a review of contemporary media, 1974, 2004w.

	 hedwig and the angry inch & a-k-w-a-r-d
	 
    


i'm in santa fe now...wow...yes wow, raven and i saw a stage production of hedwig and the angry inch the other night this was her idea, she spotted it scanning the local weekly, she apparently had seen the movie whith her father when she was 12 or 14... this was a college of santa fe production, sam quinn played hedwig, he did an excellent job, i like his performance over the actual "hedwig" movie, my apologies to john cameron mitchell, but the wig that sam was wearing and his "lolito" looks and daft delivery...well i wish had a video of this...the band was very good too..afterward there was a talk on gender issues, raven and i spoke briefly about what "gender issues" are, raven quickly surmised with one of her spot-on analysis that issues like this arise from a-k-w-a-r-d > n-e-s-s...
