   thermodynamic database
                      and
                      applications
 
 database administration, pure substance, reaction,  
 equilibrium, recalculator 
process calculator for ms excel

also integration into other process simulation software
 useful tools to calculate complex thermodynamic problems for 

 metallurgical processes, thermic power plant, cement work,
                  aqueous systems, waste incineration, distillation . . .
et al.
 in not ideal systems - with the real gas laws
 even if you usually need only a few split time for thermodynamic calculations
                    asther is the correct decision  
                all you need is, a few basic knowledge in thermodynamics and pc
