championship golf 



in a beautiful setting 











with the use of classical design by welsh golf course architect ian scott-taylor, the course at hopkinton country club exudes old-world charm where strategy plays a key role in your shot selection. “…a throwback to an era of course design rarely seen today” 



– jim mccabe, boston globe 





















































 



the best thing we did as a family 



looking back on our membership of nearly fifteen years at hopkinton country club, i can honestly say it was one of the best things we did as a family. the golf course and practice facilities are outstanding and are perfect for both families and the avid golfer. the club has provided so many great memories for us to share.  growing up, the kids got to join the sports camps, they all learned to golf here so that we could golf as a family and we have enjoyed countless family meals together. i’m a bit jealous to see how the families joining today get to experience even more great offers than i ever expected possible thanks to the great vision of our professional staff.hopkinton country club is a wonderful place for families to experience and enjoy together!
