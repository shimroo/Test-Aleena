i am a freelance mathematical sculptor/designer, retired now from
      a position of research professor in the engineering school at
      stony brook university.  over 100 of my sculptures are on
      public display around the world, many at major universities. 
      i'm always looking for interesting sculpture, lecture, and
      workshop opportunities.  invite me!  i spent four years as
      a co-founder of the museum of
        mathematics in ny city, conceiving and designing its major
      exhibits.  yes, i am related to (my daughter) vi hart.  an
      enormous amount of my work is freely available on my web
      pages.  there are no ads, so if you would like to support my
      mission of showing the world that math is cool, please feel free
      to make a donation:

 


    

over several months (during
        covid) i created a portfolio of my work on instagram, but on
        balance i find social media to be a great harm to society, so i
        do not keep it current or check messages there.  however it
        is the best way to get a quick overview of my artwork. you might
        enjoy the many images and videos:
