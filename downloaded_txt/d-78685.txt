        a&s academic diversity
        
    

uncommon academic diversity abounds here
the innovative undergraduate curriculum at a&s has distribution requirements that range from global citizenship to physical sciences to ethics and the mind. classes build upon each other and cross the boundaries of traditional academic fields. extensive work occurs outside of your major and minors, and there are no required core courses. work closely with inspiring faculty to develop the hallmark skills of a liberal arts and sciences education – the ability to read critically, write persuasively and think broadly.

majors and minors: explore the breadth of our academic opportunities


beyond majors & minors









the pinnacle of the liberal arts experience
robert s. harrison college scholar program
students design their own interdisciplinary major, organized around a question or issue of interest, and pursue a course of study that cannot be found in an established major. harrison college scholars explore subjects with a broader integration of related disciplines than most students would attempt.
more details about the college scholar program









a deep dive into the humanitieshumanities scholars programthis program offers a signature learning, research and collaboration opportunity for undergraduate students across the university who are interested in the humanities.learn more about the program 









shaping the future
milstein program
students in the milstein program in technology & humanity combine cornell’s renowned liberal arts and sciences classes in ithaca with the 21st century tech curriculum at cornell tech in nyc.

funding your summer experience
summer experience grants
summer opportunities are crucial to student career success, but these life-changing experiences frequently offer little to no funding. that’s a critical barrier for many of our students – and one that the college of arts and sciences feels is vital to overcome.
the summer experiences grants (seg) do just that. they support students with living expenses, transportation, and travel so that these essential experiences are available to all of our students, who may otherwise not be able to afford them.

        research and scholarship
