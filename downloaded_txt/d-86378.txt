important disclosures








*important details about td debit card advancesm
 by enrolling in td debit card advancesm, you are permitting us to authorize and pay atm and one-time debit card transactions when you do not have enough money available in your account to cover the transaction. a $35 fee applies to each transaction that overdraws your available account balance by more than $50, whether that transaction is made by debit card, check, in-person withdrawal, or other electronic means (up to a maximum of 3 fees per day per account). you are obligated to pay overdrafts immediately. whether an overdraft will be paid is our discretion, and we reserve the right not to pay. for example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing, you are not making regular deposits, or you repeatedly overdraft. td debit card advancesm is different from other forms of overdraft coverage in that it does not transfer funds from an approved line of credit, savings account, or home equity line of credit. the order in which transactions are processed may affect the total amount of overdraft fees incurred. for more information see the personal deposit account agreement.
1overdraft services do not apply to td essential banking accounts. we may decline or return transactions that would result in an overdraft. transactions that you make may cause your account to overdraw but we will not assess your td essential banking account an overdraft fee or return item fee. for example, preauthorized transactions and other transactions may post to your account even when the available balance in your account is not sufficient to pay the transaction.
2when items are presented for payment that result in your available account balance being overdrawn by more than $50, overdraft grace provides you with an opportunity to receive refunds for overdraft fees if your available account balance is at least $0, inclusive of any pending or posted items, at the end of the next business day.
3our standard overdraft service may allow ach payments, recurring debit transactions and personal checks to go through for a fee. a $35 fee applies to each transaction that overdraws your available account balance by more than $50, (up to a maximum of 3 fees per day per account). whether an overdraft will be paid is our discretion, and we reserve the right not to pay. for example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing, you are not making regular deposits, or you repeatedly overdraft. you are obligated to pay overdrafts immediately.
