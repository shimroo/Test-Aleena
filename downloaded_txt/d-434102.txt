behind the book’s mission is to inspire young people to cultivate their vast potential through programs centered on diverse books and authors.














increasing students’ desire to read has a far-reaching impact on their reading competence, school  success and life trajectory.behind the book’s school programs increase students’ intrinsic motivation to read and write, which sets them up for a future of success and lifelong learning. intrinsic motivation means engaging in activities and experiences out of interest, enjoyment, challenge, and curiosity.our customized school programs center on diverse books and authors, which helps students find themselves and their situations in the books they read. students get to choose the themes, books, activities, writing prompts, and art projects for their specific program, which increases their autonomy―a critical component of intrinsic motivation.click here to watch a video about our work and its impact!
