simon fraser university library is grateful to be located on the lands of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (musqueam), sḵwx̱wú7mesh (squamish), səl̓ilw̓ətaʔɬ (tsleil-waututh), q̓íc̓əy̓ (katzie), kʷikʷəƛ̓əm (kwikwetlem), qiqéyt (qayqayt), qʼʷa:n̓ƛʼən̓ (kwantlen), səmyámə (semiahmoo), and sc̓əwaθən (tsawwassen) nations.
acknowledging the benefits of occupying this land, the library commits to becoming a more welcoming space for indigenous peoples by centring indigenous voices in our collections, services, and programs.
