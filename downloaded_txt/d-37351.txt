casa for children of essex county:we're stronger together.



all children deserve the opportunity to thrive. however, when the state steps in to protect a child's safety because the people responsible for protecting them have not, a judge appoints a casa. casa volunteers make independent and informed recommendations to help the judge decide what's best for the child.to accomplish this, casa of essex county trains and empowers these community volunteers to speak up for the foster children’s best interest in court, at school and in our community.learn about becoming a volunteer advocate →
