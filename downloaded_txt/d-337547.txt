our missionmoscow nights is dedicated to promoting the appreciation and understanding of russian and eastern european culture.
our programs include theatrical and musical presentations, festivals, and educational programs.moscow
nightswe are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that presents russian and eastern european cultural programs to audiences in the greater new orleans metropolitan area.

























why russian and eastern european culture in louisiana?
 
the simple explanation is because natasha o. ramer landed in new orleans in 1984 from russia.  a professional theatre director and actress, ms. ramer enjoyed a vibrant career in her native russia; naturally, she wanted to share that culture and her experience with audiences here.
 
sensing that russian and eastern european theater and music would make a valuable contribution to local culture, she created moscow nights—and since 1999 her instincts proved correct.
