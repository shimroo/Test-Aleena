i can’t say enough about how amazing the staff is. i came in at 7:30am with my two young children and the staff entertained my children with playing the piano and showing them toys. it’s a cute little general store with toys and penny candy for the kids and odds and ends you may need. they will always have my business!

about the brewster store





built as a church in 1852, the building was converted to general store in 1866. situated at the heart of brewster, the store serves locals and visitors alike, providing a “third place” for friends to meet on the benches from the morning, with fresh coffee, donuts and pastries, to summer nights with an ice cream cone from the brewster scoop next door. 
inside is a broad, but unique assortment of merchandise including penny candy, our own design brewster store t-shirts and sweat shirts, jams and jellies, greeting cards and kitchen gadgets, linens and many other unusual gifts from the past and present. we have colorful bandanas and puzzles, puzzles, puzzles!
our book section includes the recently released a history of the brewster store, and our book brewster: the way we were. and do not forget our broad array of lamp parts and chimneys. call us at 508-896-3744 for lamp part assistance and we will be happy to help you.
we hope you will stop by soon to explore the sights, aromas, and hear the music from our nickelodeon. we are open seven day a week year round. the brewster scoop is open in the summer and features over 30 flavors of ice cream. both stores are located at the intersection of rt.6a and rt.124 in brewster, massachusetts. we look forward to seeing you.
