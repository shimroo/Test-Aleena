when your world crumbles, ezekiel 1:1 – 7:27





colorado friend monty lee posted his slides for the lesson, "when your world crumbles," which is focused on ezekiel 1:1-3; 1:28 – 2:5; 6:7-10. apple version. microsoft version.

personal note. i am giving up teaching adult bible study ( at least for now) since my wife and i are relocating to a different city.  the timeline to complete our relo, find a new church home, and for me to resume teaching is unpredictable at this point. i will cease posting slides unless i receive them from a teacher i know such as monty lee. thanks for visiting this blog over the past 10 years. i won't delete it since you can search it for past lessons, which may be helpful. god bless you, ronnie
