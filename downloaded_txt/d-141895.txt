our mission
we are a ministry of prayer and hope for the whole world, located in the heart of san francisco.
to further devotion to st. jude thaddeus, “patron of difficult cases,” and to support the education and formation of worthy students for the dominican priesthood and brotherhood.
history of our shrine


















how we serve
through daily prayer, masses, missions, and novenas, we encourage the faithful as st. jude did, and “appeal to you to fight hard for the faith which has been once and for all entrusted to the saints.” (epistle of st. jude 1:3b)
by promoting devotion to st. jude and encouraging devotional life throughout the church, we seek to bring all to christ, the source of all hope and all consolation, accompanying our fellow travelers in this world, through good times and sad, praying with and for them all the way.
