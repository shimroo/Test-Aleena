it costs you nothing additional to use us for our medicare and small group, likely this isn't something you'll run into with other agents, but if you are looking for individual and family coverage, you may have noticed some agents have started charging for their services in the last few years before they'll even talk to you about plans. in 2019 we made the decision to stop charging our clients as we had done the previous 2 years because we started to get paid by the insurance companies again and it was no longer something we needed to do. we are happy to re-announce that we will not ask you to pay for our services. we are free to use and relieved to do so.
