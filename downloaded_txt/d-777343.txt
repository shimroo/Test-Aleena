i haven't been writing enough.





...maybe that is my problem. i have no energy. i always find some of that stuff when i sit and write a while. i want to be that girl again that is always up for anything and who can't stand to sit still. i miss her. she wasn't perfect but she was better than this.

i have a lot to be grateful for at the moment though. i have lost over 100 pounds and going. i am loved by a wonderful guy, who i love back. i am off of insulin! no more injections! things are looking good in a lot of ways. i just want my energy back. i am told it will come and i am trying to have faith in all that i am told.

disappointment 





i thought i had reached a point in life that disappointment couldn't really affect me. but i was wrong. i am not going to really go into the ins and outs of it all here, but suffice to say i have a bit of a broken heart. it's going to mend up quick though. i have the support of my family and friends, and an amazingly supportive guy to lean on. i think i just was really caught off guard because things were going so well. it's just a speed bump though. i am changing my life if it kills me. and i've come way too far to turn around now. who would have imagined 5 years ago i would be sober, smoke-free, on good terms with all my family, and my good real friends. i got out of that town. i got away from those people. i ditched all the toxic caustic people that i still love but can never have in my life while they can't see they are drowning. i like where i am at, even if i am super disappointed at the moment. =)

bipolar





apparently i am bipolar with a depressive tendency. so more meds, yay! or not. but if it helps i guess i will continue taking them. i never see any of the upswings in mood, i only ever see the downswings. but i guess the people around me can see them both. i have been on the meds for a week and a half or so and i don't know if i see any kind of difference yet, but we will see. i just want to feel...right again. i haven't felt right in 5 years. sad is a mainstay, even if i disguise it as happy. it's not jut about missing the angels i miss either. though i do miss them more than i ever thought was possible.

so, fingers crossed the meds bring my real smile back, so i can put my fake one away.

who am i?

writing is my sanity and my very first true love.i'm funny. i like to drive fast, and can drive anything i set my mind to. i say what i think, no sugar coating sh!t for the people who are afraid to hear what i think. i'm smart. i write. i write well. i always have a camera. music is like air, gotta have it, and it's gotta be good and preferably loud. have survived more wrecks than most people guess and was never the one behind the wheel. my family is vast, and isn't limited to blood ties. we are more than protective and your best bet is to not test that devotion. we play hard, aren't afraid to play in the dirt, go hunting, or be redneck. i can fix anything with duct tape, electrical tape, or super glue. :) i believe that driving an automatic is just plain lazy and boring. will either kick your ass or lose mine (depending on the day) at pool, chess or poker. backing down is against my nature, and i am the youngest of three so i learned early how to hold my own. i listen when i am talking to people, and genuinely will do anything in my power to help out a friend. i won't ever be walked on again.when i speak i mean my words.when i listen i really hear.when i look i really see.when i touch i really feel.when i trust it's with all my heart.when i am broken, it doesn't mend, i learn to live with the scar.when i love it's not in passing, it doesn't end.& when i aim, i shoot for the stars.i don't need to be famous,i just need to leave my mark.it doesn't have to be on a stage,i want it to be on hearts...♥
