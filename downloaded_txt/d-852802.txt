homebuilt help










who we are
if you have decided to build your own aircraft, you have embarked on a glorious journey that only an infinitely small fraction of the human race can 
                  even fathom! books and articles have their place but nothing beats watching over someone's shoulder to learn.homebuilt help creates step-by-step 
                  dvd videos showing procedures and techniques for building experimental aircraft. we do not sell aircraft, plans or components nor do we represent specific 
                  manufacturers. the models of aircraft we work with in these videos were chosen based on their popularity in the market. the accuracy of the content of 
                  these videos is not guaranteed as manufacturers are constantly changing/updating their designs. these videos are not a replacement for your aircraft 
                  plans â always follow your plans and not the videos!

powder coating tips




consider the options for protecting your aircraft's steel parts:
every homebuilt aircraft has some parts that are made of steel and need protection from rust. the traditional solution has been to cover those parts with a suitable rust inhibiting primer and paint.

what our customers say






i have immensely enjoyed the videos and found that they have increased the speed of my build as the picture paints 
                                                            a thousand words but the video paints a million.  they also help pass the time of day at work!

i love the "scratch building basics for metal aircraft' dvd!  i wish i'd had it even before i bought the plans.  
                                                            i would have save myself a whole lot of head scratching and made better parts to boot!
