carmelite monks of wyoming monastery
praised be jesus christ!
cloistered.  contemplative.  carmelite men. welcome to carmel.


the monks of the most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel is a monastic, cloistered roman catholic community founded in the rocky mountains in the diocese of cheyenne, wyoming.  in the solitude and silence of the mountain wilderness, the carmelite monks of wyoming seek to perpetuate the charism of the blessed virgin mary by living the hidden marian life in vows to the primitive carmelite rule and monastic observance for carmelite men.  this monastery is a public association of the christian faithful founded “in itinere” to becoming a religious institute within the catholic church.  the carmelite fathers and brothers live in unwavering fidelity to the magisterium of the holy roman catholic church and the holy father through the bishop of cheyenne. with a burning love for god and a missionary zeal for souls, the carmelite monk immolates his life in the vows of obedience, chastity, and poverty for the holy roman catholic church and for the entire world. doing battle under the banner of our lady of mount carmel, the carmelite monks are the navy seals, green berets, and marines of the roman catholic church in a virile, ancient and ever new tradition of prayer as contemplative monks.


desiring to become great saints, the monks of this strictly cloistered monastery of contemplative men live the mystical spirituality that st. john of the cross and st. teresa of jesus expounded in their discalced carmelite reform, and in a purely eremitical expression.  this monastic charism includes both ancient and ever new elements such as strict monastic enclosure, two hours of contemplative prayer daily, study and spiritual reading, manual labor, and a strong community life lived in mountain solitude.  their hidden life is their apostolate for the church’s mission.  these young roman catholic monks live a full, reverent, and traditional carmelite liturgical life using the carmelite mass in latin with gregorian chant. the carmelite monks wear the holy habit faithfully, which includes the brown carmelite scapular and white mantle of our lady of mount carmel.
   
blessed with an abundance of young, orthodox, manly, prayerful vocations in a joyful community life, the carmelite monks follow the lord jesus who calls souls to follow him along “the narrow way” of traditional and ever new monastic religious life in the enclosure. the carmelite monk may aspire to be a lay brother who sanctifies his day through manual labor in an agrarian way of life or a priest who celebrates the sacraments, gives spiritual direction, and preaches at the monastery’s daily sung mass. once mature in the spiritual life, a carmelite monk may aspire to become a solitary anchoritic hermit-monk in the mountains, alone with the alone.
in addition to sharing in the carmelite's life of prayer, you may wish to participate in their contemplative apostolate and the endurance of their monastic tradition by aiding the church in building a permanent monastery for this vibrant, growing community at the new mount carmel.  as the monks rely upon divine providence, the carmelite community is deeply mindful that god bestows his blessings upon them through you, the faithful children of god.  within these pages, you will find ways to give and to assist the carmelite monks of wyoming.


if you are a young man with an ardent desire to give all to christ and his church, in imitation of the blessed virgin mary, god may be calling you to the contemplative, cloistered life of the carmelite monks of wyoming.   on behalf of the diocese of cheyenne, reverend father prior, and all the carmelite fathers and brothers, you are wholeheartedly invited to come and share in the peace and joy of the religious life, hidden with christ in god for the salvation of souls.  the vocation director and the monks are eager to assist you in discerning your own vocation.  come and see . . .

“o my lord, of all the millions of people you have created, shouldn't just a few of them give their complete attention to you?”
- st. teresa of avila

from time immemorial, god has chosen to draw certain men into silence and solitude for the “praise of the glory of his grace.”  these beloved souls have hidden themselves in the wilderness where god has done as he promised, "behold i will allure her, and will lead her into the wilderness:  and i will speak to her heart."  in obedience to this altogether heavenly inspiration, our first fathers settled on mount carmel after the crusades to commune with god in love.  our forefathers embraced a particular manner of living modeled after that of the holy virgin and our father st. elias, which was handed on to consecutive generations.- prologue to our constitutions
