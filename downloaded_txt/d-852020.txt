got a minute? view this video to learn about why we call clean air action days to protect you. these action days occur when pollutants in the air, such as ground-level ozone and dust, or fine particulate matter, can make breathing difficult for some people. clean air action days are important for everyone to pay attention to, but especially people with breathing problems like asthma, as well as the elderly or young children. click here to learn more!

consider carpooling, taking public transportation, walking, or biking every day but especially on action days. using an alternative to driving just one day a week for a year can save the typical commuter about 1,200 miles on their vehicle and about $600 in driving costs according to the u.s. department of transportation.
