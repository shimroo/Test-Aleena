time to say goodbye









after 15 years selling the best in vintage clothing and accessories, 
the time has come for me to retire.  i am sad to say goodbye to my 
customers and friends in the vintage community, but i am happy to 
welcome the changes in my life.  it's all good.

during our liquidation sale, take 50% off all orders.  simply enter 
coupon code "retire" at checkout and the discount will be automatically 
applied.  discount does not apply to previous sales or shipping.  there 
will be no holds or layaways accepted.  all sales are final.  the site 
will be shut down permanently at the end of january.

if you live in or near the tampa bay area and would be interested in a bulk buy, please email me.

thank you all for your patronage over the years.  i have met some wonderful people through this site.  i wish you all the best.

valentino 1989













just added to the couture allure website is this stunning valentino 2-piece evening ensemble from the spring/summer 1989 collection.  this set was featured in the book "valentino: 30 years of magic", published by rizzoli in 1992.  an identical ensemble was also featured in the exhibit "nan kempner: 
american chic" which was on display at the metropolitan museum of art in
 new york from december 2006 - march 2007 and at the legion of honor in 
san francisco from june - november 2007.  kempner owned and wore the 
same set.

as stated in the valentino book, this design was inspired by a 16th 
century wooden stool inlaid with tortoiseshell and mother-of-pearl.  
valentino was known to be inspired often by medieval art.

you'll see the set on the runway in this video at 1:11.  look at the movement of that skirt!

vintage butterfly dress







this image came across my pinterest feed last night.  i can't find any attribution for the designer or year.  i'm pretty sure this dates to right around 1959-62 and it sure looks like a vera neumann print, but until i can find out for sure, i'll just say......isn't it fabulous?  can anyone help with pinning down a date, designer, photographer, etc?

fantastic floral hats from 1954





evidently french milliners had decided 1954 was the year of fanciful floral confections, judging by these marvelous hats from that year.  some are stunning, some are silly, all are striking.  which one is your favorite?

1930s chanel adaptation dress and jacket ensemble








in the days before chanel made ready-to-wear clothing, it was common practice for mme. coco to authorize american department stores and high end boutiques to make reproductions of her designs for women in the u.s.  buyers and designers for these stores would attend the paris couture shows, then purchase the designs they wanted to reproduce here in america.  hence, the chanel adaptation label.






in 1934, chanel was showing many garments with fly-away sleeves and capelets in her couture line. 



now available for purchase at couture allure is this rare chanel adaptation label dress and jacket that i have dated to 1934.  even though adaptation garments are not original couture, they are still of the highest quality and were made specifically for well-to-do clients by the american stores that offered them.  remember, in 1934, america was struggling through the great depression, and the women that could afford to purchase garments like this were few and far between.



this ensemble is made of dusky pink rayon crepe and is in an even harder-to-find larger size with a 42" bust and 32" waist.


all of the pulled thread work and faggoting stitches are done by hand and the sleeves of both pieces are adorned with the tiniest pintucks i've ever seen.  the ensemble was well taken care of and stored properly for decades until it came to me.  i hope you'll go check out the many photos of this rare set on my website.  it's a joy to behold!

couture allure supports reading is fundamental







i was a painfully shy child. i found comfort in reading. books were my friends, stories were my playmates, reading taught me about the world.  children's literacy is near and dear to my heart.  but we can't encourage our children to read if they have no books.



reading is fundamental is an a-rated charity that works to motivate young children to read by working with them, their parents, and
 community members to make reading a fun and beneficial part of everyday
 life.  they work to put books in the hands of children who don't have them.

from september 1 - december 31, 2014, 10% of all sales at couture allure, sewhallie and through my retail shops goes directly to reading is fundamental to support their programs.  if you feel strongly about children's literacy, i hope you'll consider a donation to this important charity.  thank you!
