        we were not in the position to give a substantial amount of money, but we could give time, even if it was just a little. i love that cots does not simply put a band-aid on the issue of homelessness. they help by providing specific tools.

        to assist cots in a small way in providing absolutely vital services to people, in a compassionate, empowering and effective manner, is a privilege that brings additional meaning and purpose to my life. in my career as a public librarian, and now as a volunteer at cots, i focus on understanding the needs of our clients, matching them with appropriate resources and services at cots, and doing so in a way that is welcoming and encouraging.
