welcome to our internet home! in january of 2013, we moved to cannes in the south of france after living in the valbonne area (between nice 
and cannes, just north of antibes) for 22 years. before that, we lived in huntington on long island. now that we have retired (as of july 2016) we split our time between cannes
and chapel hill, north carolina. if you are a first time visitor, check the site info
