		 "torvus" counterterrorism 
		knife


jay,
			i was dumbfounded when i held my counterterrorism knife and tension-lock sheath, as in âfound dumb.â 
			both the knife and sheath felt foreign in scale, weight and utility. â i realized iâd never held a defensive 
			blade capable of defending my life, and had had a false sense of security with the automatic dagger iâd been 
			carrying in my pocket, and my fixed blade hunting knife i own. it was like the difference between holding 
			a baseball bat and a broom handle, for self defense. iâve never fended off an attack, but i realized yesterday 
			that if iâd had to, the weapon i purchased from you was an entirely superior tool, and my confidence in the 
			other knives was completely unfounded. my grip on your knife was the first thing that struck me as so vastly 
			superior. i was ignorant before yesterday of what type of tool iâd want and need in an actual fight.â my 
			grip on the torvus alone made me realize what a fight-worthy handle is, and how underprepared i would have 
			been before.â it was a humbling experience.â i felt iâd been dumb before â i had expected to feel excited, 
			and was actually dumbfounded instead. â and examining the blade, feeling the weight, i realized that this 
			blade would penetrate jackets, belts, and that the blades i had relied on before would only work if my 
			attacker was in shirtsleeves only.â i also thought that if i were to face another man with an authentic 
			weapon like yours, iâd want nothing less than a pistol to fend him off.
what a humbling experience.â thereâs something almost ancient-feeling about your blade. like a weapon 
			from before firearms when armies depended on hand to hand combat and manual weapons.â i own a genuine samurai 
			sword, and the density and balance of that weapon is the closest comparison iâve experienced, but i certainly 
			didnât expect to hold a 6â blade with the sense of heft and lethal purposefulness of that sword. iâm dumb 
			founded, and even relieved that i discovered the difference.
thank you,d.




this dinosaur of a website
some visitors are simply horrified by my web site! to them, it looks 
		dated, flat, and some even suggest i haven't updated it since the 90s. (ahem, i update about every 3-10 days). the issue is that this site 
		is not what they typically encounter. 
where do they go to see the 
		catalog price of a labradorite-handled knife? where are all the ads? 
		where are all the nested applets? where were the scripts, the 
		sub-programs, the mess? where are the drop-down menus, the scrolling 
		pictures, the mouse-over redirects and puzzling links? where are the 
		confusing large photo backgrounds and dramatic false-color styles? after 
		all, how could i be successful with such a simple website?
welcome to the dinosaur, over 700 pages of knives and words. i don't 
		want to impress you with web design, i simply want to show what knives 
		i've made during my career, what knives may be available, and explain 
		why i do what i do the way i do it. i don't need a big background photo 
		for that, or an ad on youtube, or links to other sites that want to lure 
		you away. 
if you ever get lost here, just go to the
		table of contents. and thanks for 
		being here!
--jay

who is jay fisher?
my bio and background 
	here



			"dragonslayer"
an artist


tom clancy is a name that many recognize. tom was a friend and patron of mine, a great guy who was extremely well-versed in military history and process,
			and one of the greatest authors who ever lived. while the younger generation may recognize his name in the gaming and simulator field, his mastery of words, 
			ideas, and literature was the absolute pinnacle of his genre. he wrote about many of the world's cold war and post-cold war military hardware, and i was hugely 
			honored to have my work in his home, in his library, and as the inspiration for charitable causes. it is because of tom that i have a piece in the tower of london,
			perhaps the finest weapons museum in the world. in 1994, this is what he wrote about me and my work:

"you know, i never believed in decorous weapons until i met jay fisher. where does 
			one draw the line between a fighting knife and a work of art?  
jay fisher is a throwback to the age when craftsmen 
			were *all* artists, not mere producers of products, when every item that went 
			out the door had a story and a purpose all its own, and when you went to a 
			craftsman not because of what you wanted but because of who he was.
jay is a guy who knows how to use the modern to 
			serve the past. we really do make better steel today than we did a hundred years 
			ago - the idea of cutting an ancient samurai sword in two with a modern american 
			knife does have its attractions - and the blend of old and new in his work is 
			totally seamless. a knight templar would not have hesitated a moment to take 
			fisher's steel on his holy quest. in fact, he would have thought the 
			technological edge a gift from an especially attentive god.  
i suppose that says it all. jay fisher is one of a 
			kind, a man who knows the riddle of steel, and that the difference between a 
			good weapon and a bad one is the combination of how you make it and to whom you 
			give it."
--tom clancy




a maker of military edged weapons and tools
"jay fisher is the best modern knife maker around, pursuing an 
			ancient tradition but beautifully perfecting the craft by selecting the 
			finest man-made and natural materials. jay fisher makes every type of 
			edged steel weapon, fitting the blade to itâs purpose. the worldâs elite 
			clandestine rescue and tactical squads seek his weapons. their lives 
			depend on jay fisher custom knives- the best quality knives in the 
			world."
--bernardo m. perez
			deputy assistant director - ret.
			fbi laboratory
			washington, d.c.





a fine craftsman
named "the best living knife maker" in the 2007 best of the west sourcebook by true west publications
"many fine knifemakers exist in the world. some excel at making weapons, others 
			at creating art. at his sharp instinct studio in clovis, new mexico, jay 
			fisher does both. in the blade business since 1988, fisher makes knives, many 
			featuring gemstone handles, for collectors, museums and people who really know 
			how to use 'em (101st airborne, special forces, usaf pararescue)." 
			 
--from the  
			2007 best of the west magazine
