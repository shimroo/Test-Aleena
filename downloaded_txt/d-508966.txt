horse 
        show management software done right!
the post entry horse 
        show management system is a 32-bit fully networkable software package, 
        designed by horse show people for horse show people.
the system is fast, 
        flexible, and easy to use for part-time horse show secretaries as well 
        as experienced professionals.
although originally 
        created as the most comprehensive hunter/jumper show software on the market, 
        the system has been expanded to include features for most other kinds 
        of shows as well. us equestrian, aqha, nrha, nsba, and pcha are just some 
        of the associations whose rules, reports, and results requirements have 
        been incorporated into the system. and more are being added all the time.
