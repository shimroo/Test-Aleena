our barrel option(something different & exclusive from us)we wanted something different that would set our waterwheels apart from all others. with our barrel option your waterwheel can be freestanding and the focal point of your landscape, yard or garden. with the barrel option our waterwheels need not be attached to any type of building, unless that is your desire. flumes are also unnecessary.our barrels are handmade in our shop and ready for hookup to the pump you desire. it is also part of sullivan’s waterwheels image & trademark.



















if you don’t have a pondwith the growing popularity of garden ponds, now its easier then ever to build one yourself. lowes, home depot & most garden centers carry all you will need,including pond liners. they also carry “how to guides” that instruct you step by step on what to do. you can build simple garden ponds for less than you would expect.
