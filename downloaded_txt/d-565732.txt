mcwebber html help


















  



mcwebber started as a result of requests for help in web page construction. many of
        the request resembled orders at a fast food restaurant. "help me make a web site, and
        hold the work." hence the name mcwebber was born. 
            within these pages you'll find lots of information on html and web page
        design. some pages may be under construction but information is always being added. click
        on "contents" for descriptions of all that's available in the mcwebber web site.
