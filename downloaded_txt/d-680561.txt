opened on tuesday, november 28, 1939 by the gagnon family. 
king lanes has seen many changes over the last 85 years. in 1939 pinboys would set your pins instead of
automatic pinsetters. in 1954 the lanes were purchased by the larochelle
family and automatic pinsetters were installed, quite a marvel in its
time. over the years our center has undergone many facelifts with pool
tables added in the early 60's, automatic scoring in 1989, and no smoking in
1997.  now in our third generation, our family looks forward to serving your
family for years to come.
we are smoke free.
