what is extension?
 


utah state university extension provides research-based programs and resources with the goal of improving the lives of individuals, families and communities throughout utah. usu extension operates through a cooperative agreement between the united states department of agriculture, utah state university, and county governments.
founded in 1914 as part of the smith-lever act, usu extension plays a primary role in helping utah state university fulfill its land-grant mission. though more than 100 years old, usu extension is as vital as ever, and perhaps even more so, due to the increased diversity and complexity of the issues people encounter today. the integration of teaching, research, and public service enables usu extension to respond to critical and emerging issues with research-based, unbiased information.
