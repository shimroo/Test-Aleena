welcomewhat first strikes visitors to our school is a palpable sense of community.  the atmosphere is vibrant, purposeful and very friendly.  relationships are strong and supportive.  thereâs always a lot going on and, to an extent which is perhaps unusual, girls of different ages work unselfconsciously together, collaborating on the colourful range of events and activities that make up the fabric of the woodford school year and contribute to the distinct ethos of the place. read moreour valueswe want our students to enjoy and appreciate their education and to leave woodford equipped to embark upon happy, fulfilling and useful lives, wherever and however they choose to lead them.read moreextra curricularextra-curricular activities are a great way for girls to get more out of their school life. not only are they a fun and engaging way of trying out new things, or improving existing skills, but they also give girls the opportunity to make new friends and develop their social skills. all these are important in preparing woodford girls for the future.read morevirtual toursview our full toursread more
