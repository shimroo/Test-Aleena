the 
phoenixmasonry

masonic museum and library


an independent and universal masonic resource.


"spreading enlightenment -- one web surfer at a time!"






welcome traveling friends and brethren!


this website was 
  developed to deliver further light in freemasonry. while the origin dates of 
  freemasonry in europe are unclear, for more than two hundred years freemasonry 
  has been documented as an integral and vital part of the american society, 
  culture and history.  our site is important to phoenixmasons (e-masons) and 
  the general public, because it is a well-kept repository of our treasured 
  masonic heritage and humble origins.  our mission statement fills many roles.  
  one goal, in the global world of the internet, is to exhibit masonic 
  documents, lectures, and objects in a rich historical context that both 
  educates and stimulates the traveler to continue and learn.  we hope to bring 
  the past back to life; and incite a passion for learning.  we truly appreciate 
  your visit and welcome you to download any portion of this site for your 
  personal use as masonic research and education material.
