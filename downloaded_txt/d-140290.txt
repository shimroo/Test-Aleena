like fine wine, top sirloin has the ability to improve with age.
we invite you to experience the flavor and tenderness that high quality prime certified angus beef® sirloin can yield when aged 60 days. joe bristow, otherwise known as “joe the butcher” purchases, ages, and cuts all of our specialty sirloins. having a true “sirloin expert” on our staff ensures that your sirloin experience will be outstanding.buckhorn’s goal is to give you the best quality possible when you decide to treat yourself to a great steak! in order to meet your expectations, we buy only exclusive certified angus beef®. we age our beef 42 days on premise, hand cut, season perfectly, and broil at 1500° to insure juiciness. our steaks are prepared for discerning customers who recognize the difference. thank you for dining with us.
