discography















twilight of the romanticsin 2006, the orion ensemble recorded two lesser-known romantic-era chamber works by josef labor and walter rabl on cedille recordsfor an album entitled twilight of the romantics. as commended by gramophone, “both pieces are worthy of performance, especially when taken up by musicians as sensitive and cohesive as those in the chicago-based orion ensemble.” classicstoday.com’s david hurwitz wrote, “the performances by the orion ensemble are extremely fine. balances in mixed ensembles such as this, particularly with a piano involved, always are a bit tricky, but not here. everything falls naturally into place, and the interpretations are unfailingly lively and stylish.”

a celebration of american chamber musicthe first studio-recorded album of the orion ensemble, "made in america", appeared in 2001 amid criticalacclaim. “the program obviously was chosen for its stylistic variety, and there isn’t a weak work in the bunch.” (john von rhein, chicago tribune) it features works by peter shickele, augusta read thomas, jackson berkey, and robert kritz. the album was initiated after the success of orion’s millennium celebration.
