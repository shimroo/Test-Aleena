eating stone orphanage










while i was in nairobi, kenya, i had the opportunity to visit and spend time at eating stone orphanage of kenya. eating stone was founded by dr. cyprian lumumba who has dedicated his life to helping kenyans, especially the children of kenya.  it is his belief that it is the children who can help create a better kenya. (clicking on any picture will enlarge it)






both carolynn and i have visited eating stone and saw that cyprian (in the picture on the left) has taught the children to believe in themselves as a family dedicated to each other. seeing is believing and makes you want to help in any way you can.


carolynn often refers to eating
stone as "god's
project". eating
stone is a chartered
kenyan non-profit
organization run solely on
donations. carolynn
has been instrumental in making people aware of eating stone. many ironwood village residents are contributing to help feed the 50 children
at the orphanage and also have funded special projects such as new water
tanks shown on the right. i can tell you that the continued support is so
appreciated by all associated with eating stone.



the children are housed, fed and schooled, up to the secondary level. on my visit it was just like old country school with two grades in a room being taught by enthusiastic teachers who love the children. i had to smile as the children had backpacks just like the kids in the us and i must say they were well behaved, polite, children.









the children may not have worldly possessions but they make up for that with their compassion for one another and being part of a loving family. just ask yourself would one of our children make a pull toy from a juice carton and bottle caps :-)









as eating stone looks to the future there is the never ending concern for funding the ongoing expenses plus the looming question as to what happens at the end of 2017 when their lease runs out - where do they go?  but remember this is "god's project" and as such a donor has come forward to purchase a beautiful piece of property out in the country and another donor has provided the funds for site preparation which made the property now ready for building the structures.

 i was so moved by what i saw, especially the positive impact the money being sent has had on the children's lives, that i must go back again this summer.


if you want more information on eating stone and how you might help the children in nairobi, contact rod bahnson (712.253.5951) or carolynn landis (520.509.6278)















$30 will feed a child for an entire month!!!

memorial day





memorial day is when we give thanks to all those that served their country and especially those that gave the supreme sacrifice.thank you!


armand, jean's dad, flew the flag every day and on memorial day he donned his american legion coat & hat to raise the flag. his casket flag flies on the avenue of flags in the town where he was inducted into the army.

my story of jordan & israel





this is my story or better yet ramblings about things that stick in my mind from my trip. these will not be in any order but rather as things come back into focus of a wonderful opportunity to travel to the middle east with the ancient sights of jordan and follow in footsteps of biblical happenings.

just like the africa trip last year my good friend, carolynn, is the one that prodded me to take this trip to the holy land plus providing invaluable insight before, after and during the trip.  thanks carolynn!!!

we must remember that things are centuries old, things are passed down from generations to generations and built destroyed and built again on the same spot.

so come back periodically as the story unfolds.

holy week





for us christians holy week from palm sunday to the resurrection is an important part of our lives and having the awesome opportunity to follow in the footsteps of jesus from the grand entry into jerusalem to the resurrection a week later on easter sunday.



this is a scale model, two centimeters equal one meter, of jerusalem as best can be determined at the time of jesus. might want to enlarge to get a better picture of the city.

foreground is the temple, off the picture to the left is gethsemane, upper right is place of the last supper, red dots is the way of the cross and the crosses on golgotha.

holy week was the celebration of passover for the jews and as such the town was crowded with facilities scarce and expensive. jesus and the disciples walked approximately 15 miles from jericho, now in the west bank, to jerusalem (now split into arab and israeli with fence dividing the two) to enter jerusalem on palm sunday. jesus entered the temple and chased the money changers.  it is thought that as they were poor they camped amongst the olive trees at gethsemane. (mark 11 & john 2)

on thursday of the week they gathered to celebrate passover and that has become known as the last supper.  the building was very sparse compared to other sites and in close proximity to king david's tomb. (luke 22)

they then walked from the passover feast back to the garden of gethsemane. we also walked about half the distance ending up at the garden where jesus prayed and was betrayed. (matthew 26)





walked the way of the cross stopping at each of the stations from the trial to the final destination that being golgotha in reality an abandoned rock quarry. there were pilgrimages carrying a cross up the path to golgotha. (john 19)








under an altar at the shrine of golgotha, you could reach down to touch the place where jesus' cross was set.

the church of the holy sepulchre was at the place of the tomb and had the rock slab that jesus was laid for burial.  in that time as is today, cemeteries were outside the walls of the city.( matthew 27)

whether precisely accurate or not these and many more places sent shivers up my spine and made those stories we have heard since childhood become alive.
