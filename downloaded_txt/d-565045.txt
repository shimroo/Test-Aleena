hypnotic suggestion in everyday conversation







when people think of hypnotism, they tend to think of a flamboyantly dressed hypnotist, waving a watch in front of someone’s face saying "you’re getting sleepy…very sleepy."

although this style of hypnotism is common at parties and in vegas shows, the majority of hypnotism you are likely to encounter is in fact a covert hypnotism you probably are not aware you're being exposed to.

hypnotic suggestion is employed as a means of persuasion by a variety of people and organizations for a variety of reasons. bearing in mind that hypnotism is essentially a powerful form of persuasion, this should not be surprising. the ability to influence and persuade - whether accomplished by traditional means or covert hypnosis - is useful in almost every field, not the least of which is advertising.

advertisers have on goal: to cause people to buy. many advertisers believe that hypnotic suggestion can accomplish just that. as society becomes increasingly sophisticated and resistant to the overt style of advertising employed in the past, additional means of persuasion are necessary.

naturally, they would not go so far as to broadcast commercials of black and white spinning pinwheels with voices saying "buy our product," but rather, they employ subtle attempts at covert hypnosis. 
 
covert hypnosis and the efficacy of hypnotic suggestion in seemingly innocuous statements are not as far-fetched as they may sound.

these techniques rely on subtly suggesting to someone that they should accept an idea or suggestion without outwardly voicing support or for that idea or suggestion (hence the "covert" in "covert hypnosis").

advertisers aren’t the only ones interested in the applications of hypnotism. this subtle form of hypnotic suggestion formed the basis for an entire school of thought in self-improvement and persuasion known as neuro-linguistic programming, or nlp. 
 
students of nlp have employed their own version of hypnotic suggestion to aid in breaking bad habits and addictions (smoking, etc), building new habits, and helping others to do the same.

moreover, much of the nlp teachings on persuasion has its roots in forms of covert hypnosis originally explored by pioneer-hypnotist milton erickson. 

even the more main-stream self-help community has investigated and adopted the use of hypnotic suggestion. famous self-help guru tony robbins has long championed his neuro-associative conditioning (nac) program to help business people and entrepreneurs achieve their potential. this program is rooted in the basics of hypnotic suggestion - tony robbins studied extensively at the feet of richard bandler and john grinder, pioneers of nlp, the roots of which, again, lie in hypnosis.

finally and perhaps most strangely, the seduction community has appropriated many nlp and hypnosis-based teachings to aid their conversational skills and help to convince women to date and sleep with them. a loosely-knit group of men dedicated to determining what makes women tick (and what makes them attracted to men).

by analyzing what women find attractive, some pickup artists claim to be able to hypnotically suggest to women that they have those qualities, thus increasing their dating success rates through the power of covert hypnosis.

as you can see, the applications of hypnotic suggestion are endless. so, the next time you see a television ad or find yourself in what you think is a harmless, everyday conversation, think again - you just might be hypnotized.

covert hypnosis and resistance





let's talk about resistance to covert hypnosis. most people either make the mistake of bragging about knowing covert hypnosis and get the people to always have their guards up while talking with them, some are afraid that people will catch them and resist their attempts, yet others seem so unnatural with their techniques that people naturally resist them.

before i go deeper into this, i'd like you to know that we launched our new weight loss subliminal video. go check it out and get it because it really works incredibly well!

so, as i said before many times, covert hypnosis is a natural way of powerful communication. when done correctly, nobody will resist you because it is covert and thus people won't notice you using the techniques.

of course, when starting out, one always makes mistakes but that's ok.

when people know you're studying covert hypnosis, you already have a huge advantage... there's a preconceived notion in the general population of what hypnosis is! everybody expects to either fall asleep or become completely zombie-like when you use it on them.

most people saw a stage hypnosis show or saw a movie about hypnosis and what they expect is for you to talk in a certain voice or jerk their hands really quickly or make them stare at the light and so on...

well, you know that covert hypnosis isn't about that and herein lies your advantage.

so, when you notice resistance from people, first think what category they fall into:

1.) did you tell them you're studying covert hypnosis?
2.) do you know them for a very long time and now you've suddenly drastically changed your style of communication?
3.) are you amping their feelings to much?
4.) are you sure they're resisting you?

ad 1.) if you told them about your studying covert hypnosis, there's a fairly good chance they're suspicious and therefore automatically resist your suggestions. what you should do is deepen rapport and begin only using the most covert methods (state shifts, embedded commands, nested loops, covert anchors, indirect suggestions...) until you notice they are responding really well to you again.

what i like to do is set up a trance induction spatial anchor (got this one from tom vizzini). when they are in that state, you can bring yourself into a trance and then begin shifting your state and they will follow ;)

what also works well is to talk about it. say something like this: "you know that covert hypnosis stuff that i study now? well, i read something really interesting the other day and they were talking about how people make decisions. they said that many people see the thing that they like and want it immediately. those are the very visual types. then others see the thing and only after saying to themselves: 'wow, this is beautiful,' do they really feel that they want it. those are predominantly auditory people. yet the third type of people have to actually pick the object up and only then they begin to feel like they want it. those are predominantly kinesthetic people. i noticed that i'm (tell them how you make decisions). what about you?"

now make sure you remember and anchor their decision making pattern! ;)

ad 2.) people that know you all your life are the most likely people to notice something different and tease you about it. get more covert and you can use similar pattern as above, only substitute the "i was reading about covert hypnosis" part with "i was reading about the human psychology" or something similar.

ad 3.) many covert hypnosis students initially make the mistake of amping the positive feeling up too much.  this confuses people and it doesn't seem natural to them so they will usually resist you! make sure you amp the feelings up just right for the context you're currently in!

ad 4.) most of the times it happens that the people aren't very used to powerful and persuasive communication like covert hypnosis. so at first they might seem a bit reluctant to listen on but what they really feel inside is "wow, this guy/girl is really good!" they usually fall into a deep waking trance and into your "spell" ;)

hope this clears up some things about resistance to covert hypnosis. and remember... you won't get caught unless you told them what you're doing... and even then you can always say... "ok, let's forget about hypnosis for a minute and tell me this..."

covert hypnosis story





about a year back, i attended a cycle of seminars on the subject of the brain and human mind. it was organized by our university and featured many professors, neuroscientists, physiologists, psychologists and psychiatrists.it was a wonderful week full of great new views on the workings of the brain and human mind.one particular course especially stayed in my mind to this day because i notice the lecturer clearly using covert hypnosis on us all - and very successfully at that.he was a psychiatrist and the subject was no other than hypnosis. he told us he was using hypnosis on his patients and he had a very high success rate. he also told us he also uses hypnosis daily everywhere he goes. he answered a few questions about covert hypnosis and the audience was quite a bit sceptical so i guess he decided to do a little demonstration (he didn't tell us, of course).he told us that he was going to get back to the subject of covert hypnosis but first he'd like to give his lecture on clinical hypnosis as this was the title of the lecture.he begun explaining history of hypnosis, he mentioned a few very known hypnotists, including milton erickson and dave elman. he then proceeded to tell us about his approach to hypnosis and dived deeply into inductions.he talked about how in order to put someone in a hypnotic trance, one has to get in a trance himself. he gave an example of how he talked to his patient when he was inducing trance. he begun to speak rhythmically and deepening his voice slightly every now and again, talking slower and slower. you could hear his deep breaths through the microphone.all of the sudden, i begun to feel a bit drowsy and this wonderful feeling of connection came upon me. i realized what was happening and looked around the lecture room (which was a movie theater actually). there were around 300 people attending the lecture and when i looked around i was literally shocked...each and every person in the room looked like a zombie. they were all staring at him, breathing in sync and some had their jaw dropped. it was a hilarious sight. i tried to point this out to my colleague that was attending the lecture with me and was sitting to my right. when i looked at him, i almost burst out laughing - he was just as zombie-like as everyone else and he had his jaw dropped, too.i didn't want to bother him so i listened on to the lecture. by now the psychiatrist was explaining exactly what the sensation of trance feels and looks like and then he said something interesting...he said: "when you come out of this trance, you'll feel wonderful, euphoric even. you let go of all your worries and feel great"he then started to talk about how he brings his subjects back to full awakening, suggesting wonderful feelings and euphoria all along.he then had the staff turn on the lights and said this was all he had the time for.people were completely overwhelmed (me included). some had more questions about covert hypnosis and he briefly answered them. he then said he had to go and he got a huge round of applause. we could feel the euphoria in the room. everyone was ecstatic. we were all happy to have such great psychiatrists in our country.the lecture ended and as we were leaving the theater, you could hear comments such as: "by far the best lecture" and "this was amazing". everyone had a big smile on their faces.this was a truly amazing covert hypnosis experience. we were all brought down into a trance conversationally, without formal consent and knowledge of it happening. he was really good and he really opened my eyes even further to the power of covert hypnosis.

what is covert hypnosis





way back i wrote an article about covert hypnosis. i shared it here before but since i believe it depicts covert hypnosis quite well, i'm going to re-post it.you can read the article here:>> covert hypnosisnow, i've noticed that many people still think that covert hypnosis is some kind of mind control where the subject doesn't have any will and everything is directed by the hypnotist.it isn't quite so...like with all hypnosis, in covert or conversational hypnosis, the subject is in a way agreeing to what's going on! that's why calibration is so very important.while in clinical hypnosis in a formal environment, the subject explicitly agrees to being hypnotized, in a non-formal conversational setting the subject is implicitly agreeing on being hypnotized and following suggestions.we're not creating zombies here, lol.now go and read that article. it's very informative.

covert hypnosis is easy... once you get the handle of it





i read an interesting post in my covert hypnosis forum the other and i thought i'd share it with you.

it's about covert hypnosis being pretty simple.

well, it is, but as it goes with any technique, it's necessary to internalize it first.

here's an interesting post from one of my favorite members of the forum...

[begin post]

the most significant secret to covert hypnosis is just listening. if you can hear how a person is representing something in their mind, you can easily communicate inside that model.

the real secrets are extremely simple, and the techniques that work best are very basic.

however, many of those simple things seem complex when you don't really understand them.

getting into rapport, for instance, is quite easy to do when you understand how, but many neophytes make it a very complex process. realizing the simplicity is a very powerful understanding, but it's like bruce lee's teachings on throwing a punch. he discussed, for a long time, a very detailed description of punching, but later said that you just throw a punch, however, he acknowledged that he could only just throw the punch because of the complex understandings he had developed previously.

you learn the theory, in a sense, so you can then forget it, but both parts of the journey are necessary in order to realize the simplicity at the core.

[end post]

i think it's very important to learn the theory but it's equally as important to go in the real world and use covert hypnosis. theory is one thing but practise is something else. there's only so much words can tell. experience makes the whole thing effortless.

if you're a bit shy and on the low end of self esteem, go get the self esteem subliminal video and quickly correct this. if you have any other issues, our other unique and effective self help subliminal videos will help you.

so, no more excuses. go out there and practise covert hypnosis!

how to hypnotize people without them knowing - covert hypnosis





picture yourself three years from now... you walk through the world without a worry on your mind. people gladly do things for you. you easily make new friends and almost instantly help people change their minds, make decisions and experience emotions they never dreamed were possible.you're charismatic, energetic, and extremely persuasive.as you imagine all this, still three years from now, you can find yourself realizing how great this feels and you can look back at this very moment as being the start of it all. and after you say to yourself: "reading that article and learning covert hypnosis was one of the best decisions of my life!", you can realize that this technology is pretty amazing, isn't it?learning how to hypnotize someone instantly without them knowing is a very unique and extremely useful skill... as you can imagine. and it's much more common than you might think...hypnotic trance is an everyday phenomenon. you go through it many times a day, whether as a result of your own actions or of interacting with other people. you also constantly induce it in other people, but until today, you've probably never thought of using such moments for your advantage...here i'll show you a basic way to induce a trance in a person and how to quickly slide a suggestion into his or her mind without him or her ever realizing anything strange is happening.but... before we go on, let's quickly look at what is hypnosis.hypnosis is defined as "the bypass of the critical factor and establishment of acceptable selective thinking".the critical factor is the part of the conscious mind that critically evaluates the incoming information. so, when someone says: "you're and elephant", your critical factor evaluates this statement and rejects it as false. that way your subconscious mind is protected from suggestions that violate your belief system. but not entirely...establishment of acceptable selective thinking simply means that you focus on only one stream of thoughts and you accept them. so, you could focus on buying a new car and how good it feels to have it, but forget that you have to pay a lot of money for it and to evaluate if it really is worth it. this is something car salesmen, for example, are trained to do to their clients every day!now... how to hypnotize people without them knowing in a course of a simple conversation?this is where the fun begins!the first thing you'll need is to get in rapport with that person. rapport is simply put that feeling of connection and trust between two people. it doesn't have to be very deep. you're already in rapport with your friends, but with new people, you can just compliment their shirt, shoes, maybe laugh at their joke etc. and you're done. you'll know when they like you and when they're still reluctant to trust you.ok, when you've established rapport, you can now bypass their critical mind and establish acceptable selective thinking. i'll give you just one simple example of that...a good way to bypass the critical mind is to say "what if...". when you say that, the critical mind immediately shuts off and lets imagination run wild.this is another important point... people will only do things that they've imagined doing before and felt good about it! so, after the words "what if...", you can continue with describing what you want this person to do and present it in a benefit oriented way for them.that's it. not complicated at all, huh?in most cases, if you do this correctly, you'll get compliance.the degree of the things they'll do for you depends on the depth of rapport and how well you present it to them as beneficial.this was a very short and basic presentation of how covert hypnosis works. it's a fascinating technology and once you get good at it, you'll literally have whatever you want in life.read through this blog, sign up for the newsletter, visit and register on our covert hypnosis forum and start living the life you want. when i'm done with you, you'll know exactly how to hypnotize people without them knowing.

covert hypnosis and self esteem






i noticed that when learning covert hypnosis, very few students immediately begin using the skills (which is very important)...

almost invariably there are three main problems that keep them from using covert hypnosis:

1.) fear of getting caught



2.) wanting to have perfect understanding of each and every technique developed to date before going out there



3.) not thinking they deserve to use powerful techniques to get people to do things for them

most of the times these are unconscious reactions. this means that people usually don't even realize they have a problem before i ask them directly why aren't they using the techniques every day with everybody.

after some deliberation, i noticed that all three of the above problems boil down to only one thing...

low self esteem.

think about this... would a person with high self esteem ever even think of the possibility of getting caught? after all, these techniques are covert and very easy to use... why would a high self esteem person get to the idea that anything could possibly go wrong?

and even if it did... they know they'd get out of it easily.

second, high self esteem person would learn a technique and if it could benefit him or her in any way, he'd start using it immediately. there would be no need to get a perfect understanding from experiences of other people... they'd want to test it for themselves immediately.

and obviously, high self esteem person would always know that he or she is entitled to only the best of everything... the best service, the best partner, the best experiences... and if they could ethically get them all (which is only possible with persuasion), they wouldn't think for a second before using covert hypnosis in communication...

after all, we influence each other all the time. why not do it effectively? when we don't hurt other people in the process, it's almost stupid of us not to!

if you are having any of the problems listed above, then i have a perfect solution for you...

while researching subliminal perception, i stumbled upon some amazing research... some clever scientists came up with a way to very quickly raise people's self esteem with exposure to visual subliminal messages. the results were phenomenal...

so i decided to create a subliminal video for myself to test the research...

nothing could have prepared me for what happened next...

over the next few days, i noticed sensational changes in my behavior and responses...

after that, i regularly watched the video and also gave it to some of my friends... they all experienced similar results. finally my friends told me that i should share this with the whole world.

and thus downloadsubliminals.com was born.

if you want to excel in covert hypnosis very soon, then i suggest you get the video now:

>> self esteem booster subliminal video

we also created many other subliminal videos for various other issues (when you buy 5 in a bundle, you pay only for 3!).

>> subliminal videos

check out the links above, get the videos and have a wonderful time!
