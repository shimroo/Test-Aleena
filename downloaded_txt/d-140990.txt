 search the 
lists 


you can also 
search by artist 
name, song title and/or album title by clicking on the search link above or on the left.  for 
example,  use the search function  to see all of the depeche mode 
songs that charted over 
the years, or to see how many songs from u2's the joshua tree made the lists.
about the lists
every year these stations have listeners vote on the year's top songs.  
then they play the yearend countdowns on new year's eve and day.  as you 
might expect, the countdowns tend to have a bias towards songs from the end of 
the year and against songs from the beginning of the year, so they don't always 
reflect the station's playlist that year.  in fact, as you may notice, 
there are a lot of songs that got significant airplay but didn't make the lists 
at all, and i suspect that most of these songs suffered the end of the year 
bias.
