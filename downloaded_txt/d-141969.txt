about navy arms

founded in 1957 by the legendary val forgett, jr., the navy arms brand and legacy have endured for nearly 65 years by providing quality products to our customers that retain both monetary and historic value. 
navy arms was the first company to produce replicas of classic firearms made by colt, winchester and smith & wesson, and was a pioneer in the importation and sale of original surplus arms of the 20th century.
while the products we sell have evolved, we remain focused on marketing firearms of historic importance, be it replica or original versions.
in the coming months, look for more new product offerings from navy arms that will speak of our past, as well as our future, but always, first with the finest in historic firearms.
and now, navy arms has succeeded in bringing military collectors a heretofore unseen model â€” the french frf2 sniper rifle.
