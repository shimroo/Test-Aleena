    about our church
  













risen savior is a christ-centered, bible-believing church in the rich, almost 500-year tradition of confessional lutheranism. our services are liturgical and focused on the truths of the bible. for most of church history christians have worshipped this way, because it makes a lot of sense! we are a part of wels or the "wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod." about our church>




    things to consider
  













 churches are popping up everywhere nowadays, and everyone is trying to get you in the door. we encourage you to take a few steps backwards and carefully consider what you're looking for in a church, and why you go in the first place. if you're tired of "do more-try harder" christianity, you might need to reconsider what the church is all about. the good news is probably even better than you thought!important stuff to think about>
