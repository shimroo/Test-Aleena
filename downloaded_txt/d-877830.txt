we celebrated our 10 year anniversary in 2017 with the addition of a brand new swimming pool. yes that's right! sea and sand cottages has a cool and refreshing sparkling swimming pool!




so pack up your family, favorite pet, beach towels, fishing gear, dive gear, surfboard, sailboard, boat, sunscreen and shades to head for "port a" fun in the sun.

and then, after the day's activities, come home to sea & sand cottages, where you can sit back on your own private, cool, and breezy porch, hang out at the pool, or settle inside your quiet air conditioned cottage to play cards or watch some cable tv. remember, you're on "island time!" you can do anything you want or nothing at all.




located in the heart of "old town," you'll appreciate our quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the beach, great shopping, the trolley stop, grocery store, winton's candy shop, fine restaurants and fisherman's wharf.
