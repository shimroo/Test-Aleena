many tertiary education providers grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational
program. the curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. many professional
certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. many other professional certificates
offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses
to complete the program. some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a
baccalaureate major in the same field. the typical professional certificate program is between 200 and 300
class-hours in size. it is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. most professional certificate
programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. a few universities put some of their professional
certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.

some of the more commonly offered professional certificates include:

professional certificate in accounting (pca)
professional certificate in accounting and finance (pcaf)
professional certificate in taxation (pcit)
professional certificate in transfer pricing (pcitp)

advanced professional certificate[edit]
advanced professional certificates are professional credentials designed to help professionals enhance their job
performance and marketability in their respective fields. in many other countries, certificates are qualifications
in higher education. in the united states, a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. these
certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain vocational subject.
certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education
requirements.

an advanced professional certificate is a result of an educational process designed for individuals. certificates
are designed for both newcomers to the industry as well as seasoned professionals. certificates are awarded by an
educational program or academic institution. completion of a certificate program indicates completion of a course
or series of courses with a specific concentration that is different from an educational degree program. course
content for an advanced certificate is set forth through a variety of sources i.e. faculty, committee, instructors,
and other subject matter experts in a related field. the end goal of an advanced professional certificate is so
that professionals may demonstrate knowledge of course content at the end of a set period in time.

institutions that offer advance professional certificates in various fields and industries include:

georgetown university[2]
lesley university[3]
network kings

areas of certification[edit]
accountancy, auditing and finance[edit]
see also: professional certification in financial services
there are many professional bodies for accountants and auditors throughout the world; some of them are legally
recognized in their jurisdictions. public accountants are the accountancy and control experts that are legally
certified in different jurisdictions to work in public practices, certifying accounts as statutory auditors,
eventually selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses. today, however, many work within
private corporations, financial industry, and government bodies.

warehousing management[edit]
a warehouse management system (wms) is a part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and
storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving,
putaway and picking. the systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the
status of bin utilization. a wms monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. it involves the physical
warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.[31]

more precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished
goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. in the multi-echelon model for distribution,
there may be multiple levels of warehouses. this includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by

suggestion for those countries implementing a certification program for the explosive atmospheres' segment.[34]

language education[edit]
tesol is a large field of employment with widely varying degrees of regulation. most provision worldwide is through
the state school system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or
secondary school teachers who are native speakers of the language of their pupils, and not of english. though
native speakers of english have been working in non-english speaking countries in this capacity for years, it was
not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this
field. previously, workers in this sort of job were people engaging in backpacker tourism hoping to earn some extra
travel money or well-educated professionals in other fields volunteering, or retired people. these sort of people
are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider tesol their main profession.

one of the problems[according to whom?] facing these full-time teachers is the absence of an international
governing body for the certification or licensure of english language teachers. however, cambridge university and
its subsidiary body ucles are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to
consumers of english courses, through their celta and delta programs. trinity college london has equivalent
programs, the certtesol and the ltcl diptesol. they offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are
trained in language awareness and classroom techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which
feedback is reported. both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or
two in the field. although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma
is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and can in fact be incorporated into a master's degree program.

an increasing number of attorneys are choosing to be recognized as having special expertise in certain fields of
law. according to the american bar association, a lawyer who is a certified specialist has been recognized by an
independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as
substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. these organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate
special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition is meaningful and reliable.
lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.

legal administrators vary in their day-to-day responsibilities and job requirements. the association of legal
administrators (ala) is the credentialing body of the certified legal manager (clm) certification program.[36] clms
are recognized as administrators who have passed a comprehensive examination and have met other eligibility
requirements.:[37]

marriages.

medicine[edit]
main article: medical credentials
board certification is the process by which a physician in the united states documents by written, practical or
computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical
specialization. the american board of medical specialties, a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved
medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of
physicians.

medical specialty certification in the united states is a voluntary process. while medical licensure sets the
minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific.[38] board
certification demonstrates a physician's exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of
medical practice.

patients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an
important measure of a physician's knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given
specialty.

other professional certifications include certifications such as medical licenses, membership of the royal college
of physicians, fellowship of the royal college of physicians and surgeons of canada, nursing board certification,
diplomas in social work. the commission for certification in geriatric pharmacy certifies pharmacists that are
knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the
elderly. additional certifying bodies relating to the medical field include:

royal australian and new zealand college of radiologists
american college of emergency physicians
royal australasian college of physicians
fellowship of the royal college of surgeons
membership of the college of emergency medicine

recovery. it has the main purpose of training student-candidates on how to become peer recovery professionals who
can provide guidance, knowledge or assistance for individuals who have had similar experiences.[42]

each student-candidate must complete several key steps which include initial registration; the pre-certification
review course; and all applicable sections of the official application in order to become eligible to complete the
final step, which is the ncprp certification exam.[43]

the ncprp credential is obtained once a participant successfully passes the ncprp certification exam by the second
attempt and is valid for five years.[44]

public participation[edit]
the certified public participation professional (cp3) and master certified public participation professional (mcp3)
are awarded by two regions of the international association for public participation (iap2) archived 17 august 2019
at the wayback machine: iap2 canada[48] and iap2 usa.[49] as of 2019, only 25 individuals had achieved either of
these distinctions. the cp3 designation is awarded upon successfully completing a three-step process that includes
a written application documenting the individual's experience in the profession, a written response to a case
study, and an in-person oral assessment.

individuals seeking certification are assessed against 5 core competencies, which are the essential capabilities
for a professional in this field to effectively design, implement, and evaluate public participation programs. the
competencies emerged from qualitative analysis of a comprehensive list of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, skills,
behaviors, and capabilities identified in june 2014 by more than 100 p2 professionals from around the world. the
descriptions and quality standards for each competency were developed, tested, and refined through an iterative
process involving iap2 members. each competency is further divided into individual criteria. an individual must
meet or exceed every criterion to achieve the cp3 designation. iap2 usa's program includes 29 criteria.[50] iap2
canada's program includes 31 criteria;[51] the two additional criteria in canada address federal requirements for
indigenous engagement. the mcp3 designation recognizes additional specialization and expertise and is assessed
through a written application available only to individuals who have already achieved the cp3 designation.

to maintain professional certification, individuals must maintain active membership in iap2, provide a minimum of
20 hours (annually) of volunteer (unpaid) service to iap2, and participate in a minimum of 12 hours (annually) of
continued professional development.
