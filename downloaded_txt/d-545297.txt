welcome
eme systems designs and manufactures instruments for
          environmental science. we offer both off-the-shelf products
          and the expertise to develop and customize systems for
          specific needs of our clients.

our customers are biologists, agronomists, geologists,
          architects, and others in the broad field of environmental
          science. they work for private companies or consultants,
          profit as well non-profit, universities, and government
          agencies such as the u.s. fish and wildlife service. we have a
          world wide clientele, and can ship products directly from our
          facility in berkeley, california. we take special interest in
          air and water quality, light as it relates to energy, plant
          growth, and illumination, integrative agriculture, and
          understanding of endangered species and ecosystems.

on our  products page, you will
          find links to our owl2pe and owl3pro weather loggers,
          specialized amplifiers, signal conditioners, sensors, and
          system components such as batteries, chargers, solar panels,
          and enclosures. our own sensors include probes constructed
          using the latest sensirion rh and temperature technology.

we are a value added reseller of li-cor light sensors. that
          includes the li-200 pyranometer for solar energy, li-190
          series quantum par sensor for photosynthesis, and the li-210
          photometer for visible illumination. our amplifiers serve as a
          bridge between those sensors and general voltage and 4â20ma
          data loggers, computer cards, and scada systems. our owl data
          loggers can record light levels and ancillary data.

our bat-hat is an amplified microphone cable up to 80 meters
          long that can be mounted on a pole or near a wind turbine. it
          works with titley microphones and their anabat detector, for
          unattended recording of bat calls. bats are important
          ecologically. there are many populations and species of bats
          that are endangered or listed, so there is active need to
          detect their presence.

we sell and support products from davis instruments (rain and
          wind), irrometer (watermark), and parallax (the cutting edge
          propellerâ® microcontrollers, and the original parallax basic
          stampâ®. to access the old site with information on the basic
          stamp please see this page.)
