the moderators at calgunlaws.com regret that it has become necessary to restrict access to this website in order to prevent groups and individuals who are hostile to the second amendment and the right to keep and bear arms from using the information posted here to advance their anti-gun-owner agenda, and to prevent access by inexperienced or incompetent attorneys who are using some of the materials posted here to file inappropriate and ill-conceived litigation. we hope you understand the need to limit access as a result.
