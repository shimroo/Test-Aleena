the neutra institute for survival through design
the neutra institute for survival through design, a 501c3 private foundation, takes its name from the title of a 1954 book by world famous architect richard neutra. he argued that our very survival demanded well researched designs that served health and wellbeing. accordingly:
our vision
surviving in the climate crisis through well-researched design that helps humanity and the planet thrive.
our mission
we preserve and use the neutra legacy to promote creative research and design that benefits people and the planet.
