the best and worst movies of 2019

december 31, 2019 

 miscellaneous 

                the more i do this, the more it seems wrong to call these the "best" movies when i only saw a fraction of the entries. well over 1,300 new films were released in the u.s. this year; i saw a couple hun...

 movie reviews 

                coming on the heels of last year's documentary "won't you be my neighbor?," the unabashedly adoring mister rogers story "a beautiful day in the neighborhood" puts us at risk of deifying the presbyteri...

                edward norton, whose first directorial effort ("keeping the faith") was 19 years ago, chose an odd story to adapt and direct for his follow-up: "motherless brooklyn," a 1999 novel by jonathan lethem a...

 movie reviews 

                another one of this week's unnecessary sequels is "zombieland: double tap," a hit-or-miss follow-up to the perfectly good 2009 comedy that brings back the original cast of post-zombie-apocalypse survi...

 movie reviews 

                you'd be forgiven for thinking "the lighthouse" is a comedy when the first two things that happen are robert pattinson bumping his head and swearing and willem dafoe farting. but while those and a han...

 movie reviews

b | not-rated |                 october 18, 2019 

 movie reviews 

                 "tell me who i am" belongs to the category of documentaries that are better enjoyed the less you know ahead of time. netflix is a great home for these, as the 24/7 availability and near-zero cost mak...

 movie reviews 

                you're familiar with the type of movie where a best-of-the-best secret agent is betrayed by his own government and must go on the run. "gemini man" is a very basic one of those with one twist: the ass...

                 "in the shadow of the moon" is a reasonably ok science-fiction police procedural that begins with a flash-forward to 2024, where philadelphia is in ashy ruins and the u.s. flag has been reconfigured ...            

 


sister aimee

b | not-rated |                 september 27, 2019 

 movie reviews 

                according to the onscreen titles, "sister aimee" is "5 1/2 percent truth," the rest amusing, subversive, educated guesswork. what's definitely true is that in 1926, a charismatic evangelist, faith-hea...

 movie reviews

good boys

b | r |                 august 16, 2019 

 movie reviews 

                the characters in "good boys" were born the year "superbad" came out (this very weekend in 2007), so they probably don't realize they're living in a remake of it. the girls in "booksmart" didn't know,...
