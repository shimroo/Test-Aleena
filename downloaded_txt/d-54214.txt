your first visit

looking for answers 



some answers to questions that matter. 










what is cancer and what causes cancer to develop?

cancer begins in the cells which are the basic building blocks that make up tissue. tissue is found through out the body.  sometimes, the process of cell growth goes wrong and new cells form when they are not needed and other old or damaged cells do not die as they should.  this build up of cells many times forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor or can circulate through tissues via blood and blood-forming organs. 







what treatments will work for my type cancer?

most people with cancer will have only one primary treatment for their cancer. but usually, there is a combination of treatments. the types of treatment will depend on the type of cancer you have and how advanced it is. it is normal to feel overwhelmed and confused. but, talking with your doctor and learning all you can about all the options, including clinical trials, can help you make a good decision.







how long will my cancer treatment take?

a series of cycles of treatment is called a course. a treatment course often takes between 3 to 6 months but it can be more or less than that. during that time, you would probably have between 4 to 8 cycles of treatment.







can you cure my cancer?

some doctors use the term “cured” when referring to cancer that doesn’t come back within 5 years. but cancer can still come back, so it’s never truly cured. there is no true cure for any cancer. but new advances are helping move us closer than ever to a true cure.






please keep in mind every patient's cancer situation is different and there are many questions and answers you will need to ask your doctor concerning your cancer diagnosis and treatment.  talk with your ngoc physician to best understand what’s going on with your cancer care.
