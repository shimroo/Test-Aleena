welcome to the minnesota genealogical society
the society engages in and supports outreach to the broader community - including genealogical and historical groups, libraries, and societies in the local, state, and midwestern regions, as well as diverse age and ethnic groups - to discover and share family histories through events and expanded access to education and resources.
we invite you to join us in pursuing your family history in our classes, webinars, or researching at our minnesota genealogy center. 
mgs is an all-volunteer non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.  please browse our website for volunteer opportunities, meetings, membership, and hours we are open.  we look forward to having you visit us at the minnesota genealogy center.
