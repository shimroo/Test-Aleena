								  vedic astrology:


								  since time immemorial man has got an insatiable

								  thirst to peep into the future. everything

								  starts in time and ends in time. the reasons are

								  manifold. some take the help of 

								  astrology to

								  increase their quality of life in a material

								  sense and others in a spiritual sense. some are

								  after bhoga (sense pleasures) and others are

								  after yoga (spiritual pleasures). the ancient

								  seers of india wrote a long time back certain

								  tenets by which an individual could maximize

								  his/hers potential and live with peace and

								  prosperity.

								  vedic astrology can help one fine one's true

								  destiny and can help get riches both spiritual

								  as well as material. whether the query is to

								  start a new enterprise or marriage-vedic

								  astrology can help. vedic astrology is based on

								  the movement of the moon and hence more exact

								  than solar astrology that is in vogue in the

								  west. the moon stays in a rashi (sign) for only

								  2 and a half days whereas the sun remains in a

								  sign for a month. similarly our daily conditions

								  do not remain the same. 


								  they change as the moon changes its position and

								  the same goes for our moods too. therefore lunar

								  astrology is far superior when it comes to

								  prescribing remedial measures for adverse

								  planetary influences than solar astrology.

								  consider the following example: 


								  20 year periodicity in co relation between death

								  of american presidents and adverse

								  jupiter-saturn conjunctions is given below:






									year


									event

1840
w.h. harrison died in office from

									pneumonia


1860
abram lincoln was assassinated


1880
james .a. garfield was shot to death


1900
william mackinely died later during his

									term of office


1920
warren harding died in the white house


1940
roosevelt died in office


1960
kennedy was shot dead




if you still think that there is no co relation among the above data then

								nothing can convince you but vedic astrology

								attributes it to adverse jupiter-saturn

								conjunctions. so the question that arises is can

								vedic astrology help you? the answer is a

								definitive yes! now it depends on your own

								mental faculties whether to take it or leave it.

								gems


								gems are being widely used as a popular

								astrological remedy as a remedial measure to

								counteract adverse planetary affects.

								gems have

								their own power of attracting an individual by

								their brilliance and beauty. the ancient seers

								of india called them as ratnas (jewels) and used

								them to help an individual native. though they

								are many gemstones lunar astrology advocates the

								use of 9 stones to counteract the adverse effect

								of planets. consider newton's law of

								gravitation: f=gm1m2/r2and think whether gem

								stones affect an individual or not. gemstones

								should be carefully selected after determining

								planetary positions in one chart, ascendant (lagna),

								planetary cycle and the moon sign. careful

								selection of gem can bring about prosperity,

								mental peace and success. kindly see the

								following table about the 9 gemstones described
