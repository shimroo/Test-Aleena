early history
















































gh @ itunes 
















glass harp holds a unique position in the rock history of northeast ohio and nationally. glass harp is a bare bones group in the tradition of cream, jimi hendrix experience, and fellow ohio band, the james gang. they developed a signature sound of their own – a progressive approach that allowed the members, collectively and individually, to stretch beyond the confines of standard form.

										the band quickly found a following in the thriving music scene of northeast ohio. glass harp was especially popular at the legendary jb's in kent, ohio, playing to packed houses during the tumultuous days surrounding the anti-war demonstrations at kent state. that local following led to a national recording contract and big tours with the likes of traffic, yes, the kinks, humble pie, alice cooper, and grand funk railroad.

										in their early history, the group released three critically acclaimed albums on the decca-mca label: glass harp, synergy, and it makes me glad. “few area bands are more legendary and elusive than glass harp,” – cool cleveland.
