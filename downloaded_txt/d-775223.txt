keeping football safe & enjoyable
it’s everyone’s responsibility to make sure children and other vulnerable people are safe while participating in football.
every child or vulnerable person who plays or participates in football should be able to take part in an enjoyable and safe environment and be protected from abuse. this is the responsibility of every adult involved in football, whether as a player, coach, a referee, a club official, a league official or just a spectator.
our collective role is to create a fun and safe experience for children and other vulnerable people in football and where concerns come to light, whether they are about someone in football or the person’s wider life, then to report these concerns to the appropriate authorities, some of whose websites are listed to the right.
