i recieved the cd and i want to thank you for making such great tutorials!
since i came into contact with your site and tutorials my knowledge is growing by the day, my collegue is getting pretty nervous since i showed him what i can do with photoshop! he is an experienced photoshop user but i am showing him how to use some of the photoshops secrets already, thanks to your help.

just received it [hdr disk] today and “couldn’t stop watching” i read 3 books on it and received more information on your disk then i learned in the 3 books.
thanks for your good work. i was not blowing smoke…it is worth much more then you charged for the information i received.
i am in my mid-seventies and i understood what you were talking about !!! that is no small fete on your part………

i purchased "the best of dean on lighting" and quite enjoyed it, until i got "live at brooks" and was speechless, it is the most condensed and complete lighting primer available and it's timeless, the presentation itself is a marvel.					


paul 






						thank you colin! i recently passed my photoshop cs5 adobe certified expert exam. i went through your video series to study and felt well prepared. now i feel like i know you!					


charles krusac 






						classic pro techniques 1 & 2 by eddie tapp: just wanted to say that having seen eddie at the recent photoshop world, i purchased his dvd set on pro techniques. in a word, the product is fantastic!! eddie has an incredible easy to understand style of teaching which has made me feel like i've had a new lease on life with regards to my photoshop skills.
