frequently asked questions

are your products non-toxic?


all our modeling materials are certified non-toxic by the art & craft materials institute and bear the ap non-toxic seal.


what are the project size limitations when working with your air dry clays?


you have the freedom to create projects of any size, from the most delicate miniatures to large sculpture installations.
                        if you're working on larger projects, consider using an armature or base to optimize material usage and maintain structural integrity.


how long does creative paperclay® modeling material take to dry?


the drying time for creative paperclay® modeling materials depends on various factors, such as size, thickness, humidity, and drying method.
                            
                            small and thin pieces may dry overnight, while larger or thicker projects may take several days. humid environments may prolong drying times.
                            
                            when in a hurry, you can use an oven at 200-250 degrees farenheit for quicker drying, but be cautious about the materials you're using alongside the modeling clay such as armatures. do not use the oven dryin method with our delight™ modeling compound.
                        


what kind of paint can be used on your products?


our products are compatible with a wide range of paint types, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your project. whether you prefer acrylic, watercolor, oil, or other paint varieties, they can be applied to the dried material.
                            
                            additionally, water base paint can be kneaded into our products while they are still moist. this method works best with the delight™ modeling compound.
                        


what can i use to seal my projects made with creative paperclay® modeling material?


the choice of sealant for your creative paperclay® project depends on the project's nature and intended use. options like folk art® aerosol lacquers or glazes by plaid are good spray lacquers we recommend. delta ceramcoat® varnishes are an excellent choice if you prefer a brush-on varnish.

creative paperclay as made me a better sculptor!









an excellent sculpting material for projects requiring lighter weight materials. it takes detail pretty effectively and can be sanded or affected with finishing tools with brilliant results.









a necessity i always keep in my supply stash! i've tried other brands, and i've even tried making my own air dry clay. but i keep coming back to this product!















creative paperclay is a superior air drying clay









i love adding these details to furniture to bring it to the next level. it dries hard and can form around legs and edges, and it doesn't shrink as it dries like others that i've used. this is my go to for sure!









excellent product easy to use and meets above my expectations! i run to store when running out of it for my projects. need to stock up it sells fast! extremely satisfied customer.















"paperclay" where have you been all my life !!









this clay works great in molds. it's not too soft or fragile like some air clays but not too stiff that you can't manipulate it without a lot of work. dries well and i have bought it several times.









wonderful sculpting medium, especially for dolls; non-toxic and easy to use whether a beginner or professional artist.
