 "the ww2 101st airborne produced many 
      officers whose names will long be remembered: generals maxwell taylor, tony 
      mcauliffe, west point-trained tacticians like ltc ewell and kinnard, who 
      have risen to the top echelons of the military. but you will not find one 
      among them that knew or was expected to know the art of killing, perfecting 
      it to the degree achieved by some of the enlisted men. the best and toughest 
      of the paratroopers were cold, fearless killers, who went to great extremes 
      to kill the enemy. around this hard core of fearless killers, was built 
      the greatest military machine of any war, the 101st airborne."-
pfc melton 'tex'mcmorries' company 'g' 501st parachute infantry regiment
this site is dedicated to the hard core.
