lord, holy spirit,you blow like the wind in a thousand paddocks, inside and outside the fences,you blow where you wish to blow.lord, holy spirit,you are the sun who shines on the little plant,you warm him gently, you give him life,you raise him up to become a tree with many leaves.lord, holy spirityou are the kind fire who does not cease to burn, consuming us with flames of love and peace, driving us out like sparks to set the world on fire.excerpts from ‘song to the holy spirit’ by james k baxterin collected poems (ed. john edward weir; oxford: oxford university press, 1979), 572.
