i don’t really do reviews but dr. tattlebaum deserves more than this many reviews but i get it, he’s a “if you know you know” type of doctor. i went to him for my first breast augmentation 9 years ago when i was 22. about a week ago, i gotten a breast exchange going a bit larger than before and lipo for my abdominal and flanks. he is the most caring freaking doctor and i can’t say this enough but i love him! before going under, he literally had his hand on my wrist to just support me. now what…read more »

i had a great experience being a patient of dr. adam tattelbaum. both he, his team and his entire office were highly professional, timely and attentive. dr. tattelbaum is not your average doctor. he is well educated, highly skilled and experienced physical. this is not all! it was quite a moment to watch dr a to mark my body before the surgery. i felt in good hands of a highly capable surgeon, but i also felt a touch of an artist he is a sculptor who will his scalpel creates a better version of you!

dr. t and i have been “working together” since my first procedure in 2000. most recently i got a lower facelift which i absolutely love.  my outside presentation finally matches how i feel on the inside !  young, fresh, and energetic.
over the years he has taken such good care of me and helped me be my best, natural self. he is knowledgeable, kind, precise, and has an amazing bedside manner. i’ll never go anywhere else and would recommend him to anyone without hesitation. thank you dr. t for keeping me young and vibrant!
