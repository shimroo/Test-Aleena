become a dog groomer!


dog’s today have become like pampered children! this creates more opportunities than ever in the dog grooming industry. turn your love for dogs into a fun and rewarding career! learn how…


dog grooming offers you…



wonderful pay with low overhead
the ability to groom anywhere – from rural areas to the big city – anywhere in the world
be recognized as a respected pet care professional
be self employed (if desired) and set your own hours, schedule and pay





research has shown you that a traditional dog grooming school costs thousands of dollars and requires a full time commitment of your time. is this within your reach and do you have the savings to quit your current job so that you can go to school again? dog grooming training classes provided by local community schools are typically introductory and will never provide the in-depth knowledge needed to groom a large variety of breeds with confidence! training through a mentor would be a nice alternative, if you are able to find another groomer to work with you. typically, they are much too busy and the truth is, unless the training is structured it can be difficult to learn in a busy shop environment.

again, thanks for all the grooming tips. they will be very helpful as your manual and videos are. without them i would still be stuck doing a job i did not like. i love dog grooming and plan to open a shop someday.
 


pennsylvania - donna m.


i just wanted to send you guys a big thank you! i purchased your program between 4-5 years ago. i was very happy with it. i worked as a vet tech at that time and i also graduated vet tech school and got my license. i wanted to change my profession to grooming and open my own shop because i was always unhappy with the various veterinary hospitals that i worked in at that time. after completing your program i started grooming out of my basement. a year after, i decided to open my own shop. i had 50 clients at that time and now only three and a half years later i have almost 500. i never advertised! i simply asked my clients to spread the word ?
 


rachel - 


i have obtained, to date, forty customers with only a small sign in my yard and no other advertisement. these customers have been very satisfied and some have scheduled for the future. i am excited for what spring may hold once my advertising has been circulated. thanks to your grooming program i feel very comfortable and confident in what i am doing. i commend you on creating such a thorough and educational series. thanks again!
 


ohio - samantha s.


i want to thank you again for helping me get started in the wonderful world of dog grooming. with minimal advertising (one day a week in the newspaper and word-of-mouth) i have over 150 customers and add new ones every week. this gives me enough work to stay home with my family! thanks again for making it easy and affordable to start my own business.

get to know us





become a dog groomer


we are richard and carol doggett, the husband and wife team who have been contributing to the pet grooming industry since the seventies.
after being educated in pet grooming, we embarked on our new professional career as one of a very small number of companies, that offered mobile dog grooming services within the entire usa. this developed immediately into a successful business, even though the concept was brand new to the pet community.
in 1983 we sold our mobile grooming business and relocated to a new part of the country, where we ran a retail/grooming salon for the next 5 years. we once again sold that business and were able to purchase commercial/home property of our own. in 1988 we settled into this home business that provided us the opportunity to be with our three young children full time.
while raising them through young adulthood we were able to always be there for them and also introduce each of them to the dog grooming business. they each helped us at a young age, first as bathers and eventually as full-fledged dog groomers.
