victoria – an international city
victoria bc is an international destination for people seeking anything from culture, fun and food, to outdoor adventures or vibrant night life.
hosting the mildest climate in canada, this fair weather city has many things to do year-round within walking distance of the downtown area, which straddles the victoria harbour. one of the oldest cities in the northwest, victoria has many charming brick buildings, colourful gardens and fantastic culinary experiences from all over the world. being on the coast, seafood is both prevalent and incredibly fresh, a must try for any visitors who enjoy fish and shellfish. the harbour-front walkway hosts local artists and draws crowds to watch the talented street entertainers perform during the afternoon and evening. nighttime casts a magical glow as the water and walkway are lit up by the 3,300+ lightbulbs that adorn bc parliament buildings.
walking through the city you will see horse-and-carriage tours, double-decker tour buses, and a steady stream of tourists passing by. on the harbour there are a few different whale watching companies with boats coming and going periodically to take you out on the water for a sightseeing adventure. water taxis are also set up to give tours around the harbour. restaurants and small vendors are at the north side of the walk way offering delicious food, beautiful patios and souvenirs. check out out our list of the top things to do in victoria, as well as whale watching and fishing charters.
the opportunities are endless, so delve in and explore british columbia’s capital city on the beautiful and unique vancouver island!
