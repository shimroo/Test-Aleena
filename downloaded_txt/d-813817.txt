what our campers say










"i loved how before each activity, we had a ‘met’ to explain how christian science applied to that particular activity. the ‘met’ helped me understand that i could use christian science in everyday activities." 

- camper 







"every time i get to go to cedars i feel like i get closer to god. i learn more about spiritual ideas and how to use them in my life. i feel like the people at cedars are a second family to me. they are my home away from home." 

- camper 







"i love going to cedars because of the love that is demonstrated everyday by the kids and the counselors and other staff. everyone cares for each other at cedars and no one teases you or puts you down like they do in school. when i’m at a christian science camp i see the way the world can be when everyone shows love to each other." 

- camper 







"after being at cedars, i understand better what the lesson says every week, and use it in my everyday life. i love the mets before every activity, because they help clear my thought so i can have more fun in my activity or if i'm scared, to help me to know that god is with me." 

- camper
