can you trust the bible?

over a period of 1600 years, 40 different authors wrote the 66 books of the bible. yet from genesis to revelation we find  uncanny agreement  between them all in topics ranging across the spectrum.  in fact the entire book has been cross-referenced, and found to be one unified, harmonious oracle -- as if intentionally put together that way. some scholars consider this to be the best proof that the bible is inspired. they say, "the new testament is in the old concealed (or contained); the old is in the new revealed (or explained)." the two testaments (heb. 9:15) are two witnesses (rev. 11:3). but can you trust the bible? what is the evidence 
            from archaeology? where is the proof from fulfilled prophecy? has the 
            accuracy of scripture been confirmed scientifically? here are some bible 
            lessons that demonstrate the amazing reliability of scripture. each illustrated lesson 
            is quick and concentrated with color drawings. from jewish law to british-israel doctrine 
          to star charts we stand in awe of the bible and its author.
