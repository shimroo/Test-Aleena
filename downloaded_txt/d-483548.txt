outstanding is the incredible team & courses at c4e. it has been an honor, a joy, as well as a blessing to teach from your courses because they are beautifully articulated with amazing visuals of expertise and knowledge from your staff and authors.  i have had the pleasure of teaching your online world music, music appreciation, fundamentals of music, and history of rock and roll.

i've found the onmusic companion platform to be a transformative resource, especially for music students in remote locations who normally couldn't access the resources of our main campus. its flexibility in course customization, paired with an extensive library of music assets, enabled me to create an engaging world music course that successfully connected students from multiple islands. the adaptability and resourcefulness of onmusic companion have been pivotal in simplifying online course delivery and democratizing music education across our island nation.

connect for education courses are wonderful. i have online music classes and sometimes hybrid classes and the courses work for both. i can use it for both formats. the fact that they're so interactive... i just think the format is so adaptable and the technicians are so wonderful to work with to change it and modify it to meet whatever i ask. so it's just a great, great format.
