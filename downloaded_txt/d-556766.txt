you should discuss the potential benefits and risks of humira with your doctor. humira is a tnf blocker medicine that can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. you should not start taking humira if you have any kind of infection unless your doctor says it is okay.

serious infections have happened in people taking humira. these serious infections include tuberculosis (tb) and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria that have spread throughout the body. some people have died from these infections. your doctor should test you for tb before starting humira, and check you closely for signs and symptoms of tb during treatment with humira, even if your tb test was negative. if your doctor feels you are at risk, you may be treated with medicine for tb.
cancer. for children and adults taking tnf blockers, including humira, the chance of getting lymphoma or other cancers may increase. there have been cases of unusual cancers in children, teenagers, and young adults using tnf blockers. some people have developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic t-cell lymphoma. this type of cancer often results in death. if using tnf blockers including humira, your chance of getting two types of skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell) may increase. these types are generally not life-threatening if treated; tell your doctor if you have a bump or open sore that doesn’t heal.
