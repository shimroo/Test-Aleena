grow biointensive learning centers are sowing the seeds of 
food security in  kenya

in kenya, hunger and poverty are endemic: a majority of kenyans experience chronic hunger, and farmers are often unable to afford inputs for their farms. ecology action and our african partner organizations (manor house agricultural centre, kilili self-help project and grow biointensive agricultural center of kenya
(g-biack)) are working to provide solutions.

      ecology action: biointensive farming 
    growing ecosystems of hope  for over 50 years!



ecology action teaches people worldwide to better feed themselves 
      while building and preserving the soil and conserving resources. 

aware of intensifying world challenges and the basic need of people to feed themselves, we have been working for 50 years to develop an elegant, small-scale agricultural system â grow biointensiveâ® sustainable mini-farming â that when practiced correctly, nurtures healthy soil fertility, produces high yields, conserves resources and can be used successfully by almost everyone. our goal is to help this system be known and used locally...on a worldwide basis.

biointensive gardens can help reduce global warming!

       compost is  carbon sequestration! grow biointensive compost increases the amount of carbon stored in the soil, reduces the amount of water needed to grow crops, and increases the yields for both food and compost crops. 
         every garden planted makes a positive difference.

 1st african grow biointensive symposium
 
1st african grow biointensive symposium [2015] from ecology action on vimeo.
in 2015, 25 people from kenya, the democratic republic of the congo, ghana, malawi, tanzania, rwanda and swaziland came together at g-biack (grow biointensive agriculture center of central kenya) to share their knowledge and experiences with biologically intensive farming. this is a video that captures the kinetic energy that came together to disseminate and expand grow biointensive across africa.


try our online learning series!

in  2014, ecology action held a special 2-week farmers course in willits, ca. during this amazing event, twelve different sustainability experts with over 250 years of combined experience lectured on a variety of topics essential for sustainable farming. dozens of these presentations were captured on film so we could share this unique educational experience in farming and sustainability. these films are now online, and are offered as part of ecology action's educational mission. 
now, more people than ever before will be able to learn directly from our master farmers from the us, latin america and africa, and will come away from the experience equipped to begin growing sustainable and organic food and soil to build a better future for the whole world.
