over 500competitors in our tournaments
bcs holds weekly chess tournaments during the academic school year and camp programs, including an all-girls tournament. we also facilitate our students’ participation in annual statewide competitions. our weekly competitions draw more than 200 players, and up to 80 bcs students attend statewide competition attracting over 1500 competitors. tournaments provide the motivation that encourages students to master their games. they develop focus and concentration, celebrate wins, learn from losses, and build confidence in their own abilities. many say that tournaments are their favorite aspect of the program, because it gives them an opportunity to test and showcase their skills in front of teachers, peers and parents.
thank-you notes from our students
what parents say about us
last year i signed my older two boys up for one week of chess camp. the staff was accommodating, but i knew my busy 6-year-old wouldn’t last 15 minutes in those quiet, focused classrooms. the next day i brought him, but stayed around so i could take him home when he got bored. 15 minutes turned into an hour, an hour turned into all day and before i knew it he had stayed the whole week. this past spring when i asked the boys what they wanted most to do in the summer, they all asked – can we have 2 weeks of chess camp instead of one?! thank you for giving my son & his cousin the opportunity to experience your program. they definitely walked away with skills they can use for a lifetime! on behalf of my daughter, i would like to thank everyone there for the tournament. my daughter had a great time. the experience was marvelous. she came home even more excited and determined about playing chess. thanks so much for all of your hard work and tremendous effort! the event will remain with each and every child for the rest of their lives! many, many thanks! get in touch with us
