studies show that kids who fish develop patience, problem-solving skills, and a deep appreciation for nature. plus, it’s an amazing way to unplug, bond with family, and make memories that last a lifetime! 🎥 @deanna_falzone #fishingsharethefun #takeakidfishing #kidswhofish #getoutside #keepamericafishing

shark depredation 🦈 when a shark snatches a hooked fish—frustrates anglers and impacts fisheries. a new study by fau’s @harborbranch uncovers the scope and impact of shark depredation in florida’s recreational fisheries: ✅ 43% of anglers experience depredation.✅ snapper-grouper species are the most targeted.✅ bull sharks & sandbar sharks are the top culprits.✅ florida keys & southeast fl are hotspots.research like this is critical for developing science-based strategies to address shark depredation while balancing conservation and angling interests. that’s why the sharked act is so important—it will help improve data collection and management efforts to better understand and mitigate this growing challenge.📸 researchers use a sterile swab on bite wounds from a depredated fish carcass to collect genetic samples to capture transfer dna #sharkedact #saltwaterfishing #fisheriesscience #shark #keepamericafishing

the @wi_dnr recently announced a hearing to consider allowing commercial fishermen to harvest lake trout in lake michigan—despite their own data showing that the species has yet to fully recover.⚠️ why this matters:▪️many lake trout rehabilitation goals remain unmet.▪️ limited natural reproduction means lake trout are not yet self-sustaining.▪️ the proposed allocation could force reductions & new restrictions on recreational anglers.▪️ in the 2024 spring hearing, 86% of respondents opposed this fishery.for decades, anglers have led the charge in restoring lake trout populations—we can’t let this hard work be undone.take action now! tell the wisconsin dnr you oppose this reckless proposal and help keep lake michigan’s lake trout out of commercial nets.
