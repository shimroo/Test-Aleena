animal census

posted on wednesday,january 29, 2025  by  tristan blaine 


cheeky california sea lion showing me he doesn’t care the generator is running.
the calm before winter storms hit.
while everyone on south vancouver island talks about impending snow, we’re basking in the beautiful weather and enjoying a rare moment of quiet. it looks like the california sea lions haul-out here for the bad weather, but when it gets really nice for an extended period of time the california sea lions seem to go for a wander.
we’ve had a couple humpback whales feeding just off of race rocks, and lots of whale watching boats coming by. counting the harbour seals can be tricky, but when the tide drops the rock sausages find a comfy place to have a nap until the water comes back up.
orca spirit adventures getting some up-close portraits of the steller sea lions.
harbour seals hanging out for a quick nap at low tide.
we’ve had a female elephant seal coming ashore off-and on throughout the week. she seems to come ashore at night, and travel around the island calling for other seals, then retreating back into the ocean in the late morning. at first i was really excited thinking she might be pregnant, but it seems she is not here to stay, just looking for the other seals.
with all the grass nice and green, this handsome female elephant seal is ready for a comfy nap.
grass not comfy enough for a nap? how about a quick launch from the jetty.
 
mammals:

stellar sea lions: 80
california sea lion: 58
harbour seal: 20
elephant seal: 1
humpback whale: 2

birds

gulls: 60
cormorants: 50
eagle: 2 adult, 4 juvenile
turnstones: 20
canada geese: 3
oystercatcher: 20

i love watching these beefy steller sea lions wiggle their way up the rocks.
any time there’s a bit a weather, the whole gang is gonna post up on the jetty.
meanwhile on south rocks the steller pile has aggregated into one large handout.

frost!

posted on wednesday,january 22, 2025  by  courtney edwards 


woke up to frost on the ground this morning. weather is still clear skies and light north wind.
roughly 50 ancient murrelets fishing off the jetty this morning.
tourism boats: 2
frost!
this warm weather means that there are still lots of plants blooming out here
classic confused crocus’

all systems still nominal

posted on sunday,january 19, 2025  by  courtney edwards 


this spell of calm, clear weather continues.
usual chores today: check energy system, clean pathways, generally tidy up outside knowing that this weather can’t last forever.
tourism vessels: 2
private vessel: 1
a sailing ship called venturosa passed through the reserve today. ais says she’s 33m and was bound for victoria.

clear skies. light wind. great sunset.
tourism vessels: 2
my future-firewood pile is growing. if a good log comes through i sometimes tie it to the shore and try to work it up higher with the tides over the course of a couple days. otherwise, i can buck it up into human-scaled lengths and move it to the pile.
pile of future-firewood
this one is a keeper for sure.

gps tagged california sea lion

posted on wednesday,january 15, 2025  by  courtney edwards 


i make maps for a living, so you better believe i was excited to find a sea lion with two telemetry tags pinned in its flipper-pits. i reached out to kendra and our contacts at oregon state and got an answer the next day!
california sea lion: branded x103
x103 is an animal they tagged (odfw, wdfw, ucla, and others) in astoria, oregon on august 29, 2024, as part of a research project looking at disease ecology and movements of california sea lions.  more information about the project can be found here: at this link  (x103 isn’t listed here yet but the 2023 cohort is)
for information on the whole research project: the eastern pacific marine one health coalition https://marineonehealth.or

 
maintenance:
since talking with the oregan taggers, i’ve been reaching out to our other animal reporting partners and getting updated emails and protocols. i’ll use this information to update in the sop.

fuel delivery

posted on tuesday,january 14, 2025  by  courtney edwards 


the pearson college crew came out today and did a big diesel delivery. we got the jerry cans filled up and stowed back in their shed. the generator building has a 200 li barrel and a 100 li tidy tank, and the tank shed is mostly full. always feels good to be resource righ! very nice to move all that liquid across the island with help.

calm evenings

posted on monday,january 13, 2025  by  courtney edwards 


i make a point to go up the tower every day. currently working towards 3 consecutive trips up the tower without it feeling like my heart is going to explode. fitness in small places requires some creativity.

firewood

posted on friday,january 10, 2025  by  courtney edwards 


been doing chores. this week has no precipitation forecasted so i let the stack of logs dry a little and then split it and got it stacked in the basement. although it’s warm now but i’m sure winter will hit us at some point so it’s nice to have a good supply of wood. also lets us use much less dielse for the furnace in the house.

engine auto test

posted on thursday,january 9, 2025  by  courtney edwards 


settled in the the island routine.
the daily water sample is a bit hectic with the lack of electric fence on jetty. i’ve found the supplies so i’ll put that back up in the next week.
we are testing running the gererator on auto. which means that it turns itself on when the voltage reaches a set point. i’ve been logging the fuel consumption so i’ll be able to see how much we burn over the course of the week. this model keeps the batteries really happy because they get topped up to 100% state of charge and float there for a while. keeps the plates clean and the batteries nicely conditioned. i do an engine check and battery fluid check every day just to make sure it;s all running smoothly.
 
the view from my morning tea perch. showing our am/pm satelite checkin spot.
someone has 3d printer skills! there’s a few very cute lampshades out here based on pictures of the tower. dark areas are thicker material, light areas are thinner material. kinda magic!
