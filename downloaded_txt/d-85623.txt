review for agent: jim kredell

review for agent: olga osusky

— ernie s.




review for agent: john may
i had such a wonderful experience dealing with you guys and most impressed with john may. the moment he picked up the phone he was immediately helpful and offered great insight and led me to many fine options. it is hard to find someone who has the ability to listen to a client’s needs and immediately execute on solutions. this shows me john knows his craft and is very resourceful. i will never call another agent besides john for all future needs. it is a real pleasure dealing with a real professional. 

— patrick d.

— andrea f.

“ellen lucas has done a remarkable job over the several years she has been our agent. she was very responsive to any issues that arose and was an efficient intermediary with the owner when needed. we look forward to working with her and the agency in the future. the guide is helpful and convenient even though we have been coming to lbi most of our lives.”

— bruce r.




review for agent:   michele timlin
“i didn’t use the home guide b/c i’ve been going to lbi for 57 years, so i know the island very well. however, for a 1st time guest it looked to be very helpful. our house (bottom floor duplex), the location, the weather was great, but the owner upstairs was very unfair. he decided to redo his deck during prime season. i reached out to our realtor to tell her what was going on and she addressed it immediately. i’ve been working with michele timlin for quite a few years now and will continue for many more! thanks michele!”

— betsey s.

review for agent: ellen lucas
“this is note to recognize the outstanding service and extra effort that our family received from ellen lucas to ensure that our two-week summer vacation at the shore could be completed as planned.  
at the completion of our 2023 summer vacation, we indicated that we wanted to rent 1905 atlantic from 7/22 – 8/3 2024.  in late february we received notice that we would be able to rent the property for the first week but not the second since the owner was planning to use it. so late in the rental season we needed to find a second week in the spray beach area, not an easy task when most places are already booked.
ellen worked hard on our behalf. she found a very nice property on 26th street and was able to arrange a late check out and early check in for us.
i would like you to know that we appreciated her efforts and are looking forward to working with her again to secure a house for the 2025 summer season.”

— paul w.
