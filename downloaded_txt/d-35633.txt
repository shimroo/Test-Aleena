music and the spoken word 


the ultimate source for inspiration


        tchaikovsky, the famous composer, once said, “inspiration is a guest that does not willingly visit the lazy.” true. inspiration takes work! it isn’t something we simply download and receive with the click of a button, like we might do for the newest app on our phone. instead, we must look for it, internalize it, and even appreciate where it can lead us.
