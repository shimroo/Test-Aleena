welcome to the get bear smart websitethis site was originally created by the get bear smart society (gbss), a key founder of the bear smart community movement, with its groundbreaking whistler bear smart program in bc. the society has been a catalyst in bear education and bear smart community work, helping people manage attractants and encouraging managers to choose non-lethal options. the whistler and other programs continue to serve as models for other communities. to expand this important work, gbss has handed off this website after 27 years of operations. the get bear smart website is now managed by people and carnivores … continue
