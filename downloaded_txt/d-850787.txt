 i was actually referred to anthony by a very close friend. my case was dui - felony/accident and i was facing 1 year in jail alongside with dui classes etc. very very difficult moment in my life, since this was my first and only time i have ever been in trouble with the law. prior to anthony i called 5-6 lawyers, it is very difficult to find a lawyer that appears to care about your well-being and the outcome of your case. i would agree that anthony does make you feel comfortable, safe, and faces reality of what might come with your case, he does not sugar coat anything but instead allows you gain trust in him that he will fight for you which is always good. his assistant monica is amazing! ask her anything, she will answer promptly. he made sure to try many alternatives with my case since it was very serious and my judge was a hard one to compromise with. however, the result was 180 days in county jail (actually served 27 days) and 180 days on scram, (which isn't that bad just paying sucks) although no one wants to serve any time in jail, you never really know the outcome of your actual case. anthony is def. a professional and knows what he is doing when it comes to dui cases. i would recommend him to anyone.	   http://www.labestdefense.com/?testimonial=j-d

 i needed an attorney for my cousin who was arrested over the weekend. i didn't want just any lawyer because my cousin was facing felony charges and prison time. a friend of mine told me that his brother used anthony and that he swore by him. so, i decided to do my research. i looked up anthony's reviews on yelp and on avvo and i could see why my friend was so adamant that i give him a call. i spoke to his assistant monica who immediately put me at ease.  she explained to me that anthony was in court but that she could squeeze me in the same day (since my cousin's court date was the following day). when i met with anthony, i realized what the other reviewers were referring to. he had a very chill demeanor to him. he was very friendly and listened. the other two lawyers that i met with prior to anthony basically spoke down to me and were just interested in our money. one thing i liked about anthony is that he didn't make any grand promises without having read a single police report. he was realistic and confident in his skills and his contacts. anthony met with the prosecutors assigned to file my cousin's case and was able to get them to reject the case.   my cousin was released and doesn't even have to go to court ever again. thank you anthony and monica.  you guys were a great team in a really tough time. i will be forever sending you clients.	   http://www.labestdefense.com/?testimonial=denise-t

 this man gave me a second chance at life when i thought there was no hope at all. in january 2015 i was arrested for possession for sales due to some idiot i barely knew, which i gave a ride to, jumping out of my car and leaving his drugs behind in my car as soon as he saw the cops. i bailed out but was on probation in another county, not to mention having a strike on my record from a previous arrest in 1998. after doing 6 months in jail for the probation violation, i began researching attorneys online. i researched for a month looking for the best ! during my search anthony arzili kept popping up first no matter what i typed into the search engine. so, i made the call and scheduled a meeting with him. it took only 10 minutes into our meeting before i knew he was the one! after 8 months of court appearances and the only offer ever given to me being 3 years minimum, i walked into court yesterday, they called my name, i stood there in front of the judge and heard the d.a. say we would like to dismiss this case, judge said case dismissed and i nearly fainted. i don't know why or how but he did it! anthony arzili gave me my life back! this man is a miracle worker. i tell you now, if your searching for the best....look no further, there is no better attorney out there!	   http://www.labestdefense.com/?testimonial=andrea-g

 february 5, 2015 was the worst day of my life. i was arrested  and accused of selling prescription rx pads to unlicensed doctors labeling me a drug dealer. i was facing certain jail time. i was an authorized printer for medical prescription pads and solely dealt with licensed doctors. unfortunately a doctor i had dealt with for many years had failed to inform me that he had lost his medical license and was currently being investigated himself and informed the dea that i had sold him the pads knowing his situation. long story short i was arrested for selling this doctor prescription rx sheets. i had contacted several attorneys in regards to my situation but some i felt did not have experience in this kind of case and others did not make me feel l had a chance. also money was a little tight and some attorneys wouldn't work with our financial situation. anthony was able to work with us. my husband was looking online and had read the many great reviews on attorney anthony arzili. his website was very informative and very detailed in previous past cases. he has dealt with many cases somewhat similar to ours and we decided to contact him. i personally have never been in trouble with the law before and was absolutely terrified of what was to come. meeting with anthony that day made me feel so much better, happier and more confident about my chances. it was the best decision i have made in a very long time. anthony assured me that he will do everything in his power for the best outcome possible. anthony is a man of his word. anthony was also able to work out a payment plan with us, thank god. anthony was able to save me from going...	   http://www.labestdefense.com/?testimonial=frank-s
