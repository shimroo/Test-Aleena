congressional sex scandals





the recent dc sex scandals are, of course, unfortunate and rather disheartening. former house rep mark foley and his solicitation of teenage house pages, senator david vitter and his prostitute rompings in dc and his home-state of louisiana, and now senator larry craig and his bathroom antics are enough to turn even the most blindly-loyal american into a jaded pessimist. but do (and should) the actions of a few members of congress reflect upon the rest of the bunch? absolutely not.  it may seem as if all politicians are corrupt nowadays, but through my experiences on capitol hill i have witnessed plenty of good come out of the capitol building. in fact, the good greatly outweighs the bad. trust me. there are staff members who work 20 hour days and don’t get paid overtime - just because they want to move legislation along. there are members of congress who go out of their way for their unpaid interns and buy them pizzas for lunch or let the interns tag along with them for the day. there are freshman senators who truly want the best for their home state and the nation and will not take ‘no’ for an answer. capitol hill is not the dirty, dingy place the media paints it to be. don’t be fooled, and take everything with a grain of salt. everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt. read more
