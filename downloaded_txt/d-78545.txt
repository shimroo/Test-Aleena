ness energy international, inc.update | october, 2022many ness shareholders have been asking for updates and are frustrated none have been posted for over a year.  although i have not lost any hope or the vision to see the dead sea oilfield in israel discovered in the future, i have reached a point where i do not want to create false hope concerning moving ness forward.  i have refrained from posting on ness' webpage in hopes of receiving a clear confirmation in prayer that ness will or will not move forward.  i have yet to receive any clear answer, but i did not receive a “will not”.  therefore, i will continue to steward on over ness’ future. in years past i have felt compelled to try and "push" ness energy forward and have been guilt motivated that i had to perform and personally make the company successful. just this year i have recognized my short comings concerning past influences and motivations that were not based in the lord’s true shalom and trust. therefore, i felt i needed to step back and place everything concerning ness energy and the well in israel on the altar of the lord as a sacrifice. i can tell you, it has been extremely difficult to wait and do nothing. at the same time i had nothing of material substance to report. i wrote the update below a number of months ago, but could not get a spiritual release to post it. the following information is, again, spiritual in nature and does not contain any financial news. as i write this introduction it is in the middle of the ten days of awe between rosh hashanah (feast of trumpets) and yom kippur. so, may i proclaim, shana tova to all of the readers for this spiritual new year. may we all walk fully as the “willing and obedient of the land” to our lord and savior jesus.baal perazim: lord/master of the breaking forth or god of the breakthrough.the picture below is of a beautiful work of art located in the center of the park where i some time walk and pray. the monument was created to commemorate the discovery of a large oilfield that was critically important to supply oil to the usa during ww ii. the oilfield is located in my home town of edmond, ok, a suburb of oklahoma city situated in central oklahoma.  one particular day in june of 2019 during my prayer walk i was struggling with hopelessness about the funding of the well and ness energy.  at the conclusion of my walk i found myself drawn for the first time to go over and read the story on the monument.  as i read it it turned out to be an amazing one of faith and tenacity. (you can zoom in on the picture on your device and read the details of the unique story.)  words cannot describe how the details of the special story pierced my heavy heart and renewed hope and the confidence i needed to continue this journey of faith. from that day on every time i take a prayer walk in the park i often end by stopping and rereading the story and giving god thanks and praise for providing all required to complete ness’ mission in israel.in january of this year, 2022, at the end of another prayer walk as i read the story again and worshiped, i experienced an unusual thought or some might call it a clear “prompting” within to specifically name the well “baal perazim.” as most of those familiar with bible stories know it was the location of the first battle david fought after he was anointed king. this special location of his first and special victorious battle over the philistines as described in:2 samuel 5:20 evangelical heritage version20 so david went to baal perazim and defeated them there. he said, “the lord has broken through my enemies before me like a wall of water.” that is why he named that place baal perazim.[a] foot note:baal perazim means lord of breakthroughs.













i had always known perazim would be a portion of the well name, but i was reluctant to use baal as it also was the name of the infamous god of the philistines. i was excited and reluctant as i walked away. we are supposed to “prove” all “spirit prompted words”.  as i began to research more into the definition and meaning of the hebrew word/name baal and its meanings, i was blessed and all my doubts were turned to peace. following i will provide what i discovered and how the information birthed a beautiful revelation of the many faceted well name: baal perazim.in hebrew baal means husband. when i read this definition i was smitten with joy at the thought of modern day jews first thinking of the well name being “husband of the breakthrough.” research provided the following:baal (verb)(01166)(baal בָּעַל) to marry, to rule over, to have dominion, to get a husband.  in relation to marriage, it refers to marrying a woman (dt. 24:1); or a woman to be married (prov. 30:23). figuratively, the verb baal refers at least 3 times to jehovah's "marriage" to israel (isa 54:5, jer. 3:14, jer 31:32-note)isaiah 54:5 new international version5 for your maker is your husband—    the lord almighty is his name—the holy one of israel is your redeemer;    he is called the god of all the earth.as i searched for scriptures with the name baal, as it relates to god being or becoming israel’s husband, here’s one of the ones that blessed me the most:isaiah 62:4 amplified bible, classic edition4 you [judah] shall no more be termed forsaken, nor shall your land be called desolate any more. but you shall be called hephzibah [my delight is in her], and your land be called beulah [married]; for the lord delights in you, and your land shall be married [owned and protected by the lord].net note: hebrew (beulah), traditionally transliterated "beulah" (so kjv, asv, niv).waltke -  the name of the land, beulah (passive participle of bāʿal), signifies both the intimacy and the joy of yhwh in conjunction with the land (ʾereṣ,comment - from beulah thus comes the phrase ''beulah land''...it spoke of god's promise to israel of a future land and a future hope. nt believers can use the term by way of application because they have been engrafted as wild olive branches into the rich root of the olive tree of the abrahamic covenant.the beauty of the name, baal, “beulah land” - yhwh marries the land of israel.perazimnow let’s look deeper into the history and meaning of the name perazim. in genesis chapter 38 the patriarch judah conceived two sons through his son’s widow, tamar to whom he refused to give to his youngest son in order to bring forth children on behalf of his dead brother. here’s the scripture relating to the birth of perez and his brother zerah.genesis 38:29 amplified bible, classic edition29 but he drew back his hand, and behold, his brother was born first. and she said, what a breaking forth you have made for yourself! therefore his name was called perez [breaking forth]. 30 and afterward his brother who had the scarlet thread on his hand was born and was named zerah.judah was the fourth son of jacob by leah and his name means “praised”. judah is the southern portion of the promised land and the tribe from whom jesus is born.tamar in hebrew means “palm-tree”.an interesting fact is that the dead sea is located in judah and located at the southern end of the sea there is a kibbutz named tamar. this kibbutz is home to a large date palm tree farm. i took pictures of the signs below and they show the name of the wadi- a dry river bed, to be perazim which is located at the very southern end of the dead sea near where kibbutz tamar is located.  the actual town of tamar is thought to be located several miles further south of the kibbutz, but the actual location of the ancient town is still in question.  additionally, the area is thought to be near the infamous cities of sodom and gomorrah.  if you were to put to together the sequence of and meaning of the biblical story above along with the current physical location names it would be as follows:from the land of judah will be birthed a son from tamar and his name is perez “breaking forth” and the location of the well to be drilled will be named baal (husband or lord) perazim (of the breaking forth) will be located near the tamar date palm kibbutz crossing the wadi perazim.  the god of abraham, isaack and jacob will prove to be a faithful husband to beulah land and their marriage.

i am encouraged by what occurred in january of 2022 at my home town park where the name, baal perazim, was dropped into my heart. i went from doubting the name was really from the lord until i began to research and determined it can mean husband and beaulah.  beulah land, the land god has promised to marry.another beautiful description of the lord being israel’s husband and marrying her:hosea 2:16-20evangelical heritage version16 in that day, declares the lord, this is what will take place:    you will call me “my husband.”    you will no longer call me “my master.”[a]17 for i will remove the names of the baals from her mouth.    she will no longer call them by their names.[b]18 in that day i will make a covenant for the israelites with the wild animals, with the birds of the sky and the things that creep on the ground.    i will break the bow and the sword.    i will abolish war from the land.    i will allow the people to lie down safely.[c]19 i will pledge you to myself in marriage forever.    i will pledge you to myself in marriage—    with righteousness, justice, mercy, and compassion.20 in faithfulness i will pledge you to myself in marriage,    and you will know the lord.footnoteshosea 2:16 hebrew my baalhosea 2:17 or call on their nameshosea 2:18 or securelycould the baal perazim well be one important confirmation of isaiah 62:4 and hosea 2:16-20 by the consummation of the lord’s marriage produce what is required to provide housing as a wedding gift from the lord;  housing for his wife, when the diaspora’s all return?  we will continue to walk this journey forward.in jesus name, david m. boycepresident & chairmanness energy international, inc.
