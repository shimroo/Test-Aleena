the toss® technology advantage
what sets packworldusa apart from others is its use of the high response, state-of-art, toss technology, better known in the industry as "the optimum sealing system".









































all packworldusa machines come equipped with advanced toss technology and pireg® impulse temperature control. unlike other heat sealing methods, only toss uses variable resistance controlled (vrc) heat sealing technology to monitor and adjust temperature precisely over the full length and width of the heat sealing element.
digitally accurate to 500˚c via toss technology and pireg® impulse temperature control, the inherent inconsistencies of thermocouple controls are eliminated and customers are assured of consistent, repeatable seals from one machine to another as well as from the first seal to the last.
