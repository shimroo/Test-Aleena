	crystal cove car show (now known as cars & coffee)
	
  
select highlights of the crystal cove car show.
this incredible show had formerly taken place just south of newport beach - in the center of some of the most beautiful and highest priced real estate around.  it now has a new home in irvine (see below right for info).  an amazing gathering of all types of vehicles - there truly is something for everyone at this weekly gathering.

	 time for something new.....
    


after taking pictures for the last few years, it was time for a change.  taking hundreds of shots each and every week, just to have them fly by in a post ended up being just like the shows themselves - blink, and you miss it...but no more.  today, i announce the debut of autoworksphoto.com .   all future coverage of cars & coffee will be under this site, as well as other southern california events.  if that's not enough reason to go there, i've gone through tens of thousands of shots to pull out all the highlights of the last two years at crystal cove as well.  before looking back at it, you sometimes forget the incredible vehicles that showed up there.  hopefully, you'll find something you'll like.  :)the autoworks photography site has a full comment system, as well as photo rankings, so feel free to give your opinion of what you see.  and a keyword system, so you can find the shots you want.  and of course, you can buy high quality prints of each and every picture.  ;)come by, check it out, and get familiar with the future location of all my coverage...  :)jay
