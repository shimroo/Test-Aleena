the playstation network unexpectedly went down over the weekend in what ended up being the longest outage since the major multi-week shutdown in the ps3 era. this left a lot of gamers wondering why the network went down for so long, while others wondered what entitlements they might get due to the downtime. while all the answers aren't available yet, we speculate what may have occurred and when or if we will get more facts about the downtime. all this and much more gaming news make up another week of the longest running video game podcast, orange lounge radio!

tonight's show starts with a live listener question on how our current political climate might effect video games. we make predictions best we can on how big releases this year might shift depending on what this political climate holds. sadly, the gaming industry climate is far too full of layoffs, as major layoffs hit bioware studios, seemingly leaving the next mass effect title as a make or break game for the studio. we discuss all this, more in gaming news, and yes food too on another week of the longest running video game podcast, orange lounge radio!
 
also in the news:
 
* forza horizon to come to playstation
* switch 2 experience brings out scalpers
* new sega trademarks in japan
* no more ps4 games for ps plus (in 2026)

finally after months of rumors, mockups, and much internet speculation, the nintendo switch 2 is finally officially unveiled. while it is a short two minute sneak peek, it's enough to confirm most of the rumors we have heard thusfar. what are our early impressions of what we've seen? and how about that quick peek at a new mario kart game? there is still much more to unveil in april, but that doesn't stop the nintendo chatter from continuing. all this and much more gaming news make up another week of the longest running video game podcast, orange lounge radio!
 
also in the news:
 
* more live service games cancelled at sony
* marvel snap goes dark unexpectedly
* evo 2025 lineup
* card trading coming to pokémon tcgp
