bass fishing with licensed professional-full time guideon fayette county lake in central texas. r.w. "bob" green1782 dusty lane-- ledbetter, tx 78946281-460-9200
 



i love to fish and have spent many years learning the habits of the fish on fayette county lake.  i am a full-time guide and fish exclusively on this lake.  being a resident in the area, i am on the water several times a week - with or without clients. this allows me to keep up with fish movement and their many different patterns. most bass boated are good solid fish; however, many trips have produced the biggest “large-mouth bass” clients have ever caught.  “fishing” is my only business and yes, it is my passion.  it’s my goal to make sure your day on the lake is enjoyable.  r. w.  “bob” green!​to book a trip, call me at 281-460-9200 oremail me a message and your phone number, i will get back with you.​bobgreen@cvctx.comnotice!​   park prairie park restrooms, boat ramp, and rv loop are now open.  check availability on lakefront cabins. for more information contact oak thicket park 979-249-3504.
