testimonials















— a happy dog boarding client, overland park








i highly recommend dog pawz for play days and overnights. we left town and had our boxer stay with them for 5 nights and she came back excited and not wanting to come home. the staff is amazing and the dogs are always well taken care of!













— melanie p., downtown kansas city








the longest i’ve left foxy was for 6 nights/7 days and there was not an issue the entire time. everything was perfect & i picked her up happy & freshly bathed with her free bath… the staff was friendly & calm, thorough in setting up the appointment and excited to meet foxy!













— amanda r., kansas city mo








thanks dog pawz for entertaining my puppy. this winter has been brutally cold and thanks to your amazing space – with lots of great dogs, my shafer can play and socialize. thanks for exhausting the little guy. we love you!
