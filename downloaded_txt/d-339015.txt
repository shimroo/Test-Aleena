lira - lost & found review

* swedish translation by google: before raul midón was signed by arif mardin to manhattan records in 2005, he had driven behind shakira, alejandro sanz and julio iglesias. since then, he has released a series of plates, with the new one being the thirteenth in a row. the new album does not offer any new choices in terms of styles, you recognize yourself in the artist's world where a relatively smooth singer-songwriter style is the main flavor spiced with some jazz, for example in the soft piano ballad wall of indifference. a supple, soft voice and a varied playing of the acoustic guitar are typical of the blind singer.lost & found moves between life's joys and difficulties through ten well-written songs. in the title song, a nice on the road flow is established, while next time offers more resistance with broken expectations and keep on keeping on is a slightly funkier song where life is still quite okay. here is also the latin-scented anything at all. he varies the arrangements between the songs without the feeling becoming fragmented. a small, well-playing band with drums, bass and keyboards dress up the songs in neat arrangements. all in all, not bad at all.
