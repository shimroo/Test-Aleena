take a peek at our crowdsourced game based learning project, the phylo trading card game and  a deck or two! also, check out the research examining the pedagogical and behaviour effects of playing this game.

ambl (advanced molecular biology laboratory) is a fully equipped research lab that specializes in educational programs and is in the fortunate position of being resourced to provide a superb learning environment complete with state of the art equipment. in all, many of ambl’s programs centre on a mandate to train scientists (university students, faculty, and industry professionals) and to inform the public at large on the societal, cultural, economic, political, and ethical nuances of the sciences. as well, ambl has made a name for itself by often using creative and unconventional avenues of science communication and education, particularly where the intersection of science and other disciplines is explored. please read more about our programs and projects by visiting the pages that outline our outreach activities, our professional and research options, our web initiatives, and our association with the university of british columbia. to check out individual projects, please scroll down and look through our portfolio.

 "excellent workshop! very good review of the molecular biology techniques. dave makes the theory very clear and interesting. also takes time to answer specific questions/issues regarding personal ongoing projects. the workshop will definitely help for future troubleshooting. thanks!"− chantale andré, environment canada "excellent review of the pertinent techniques. easy way to conceptualize my readings and correlate with clinical use. dr. ng is extremely knowledgable, entertaining, and provides useful tips on how to use techniques in real-life situations."− dr. edward lum, m.d. vancouver. "awesome! excellent mix of theory and practice. dave keeps it interesting, well-paced and fun. great for people new to molecular biology techniques, or people needing a quick refresher and updating to current methods."− dr. ann marie davison, biology, kwantlen polytechnic university "i don’t think this much info could be done any better in this timeframe!"− keith turner, program head, bcit biotechnology, british columbia institute of technology "the workshop went far beyond my expectations. i now feel ready to introduce several new techniques to my lab, but beyond that, i will now be better able to teach my class in september. dave is a fantastic teacher, and i can only hope that some of that will have rubbed off."− matt s. ramer, asoociate professor department of zoology/neuroscience, british columbia neurotrauma fund chair
