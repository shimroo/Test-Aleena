you know my name contains 30 short stories and novelettes. 600 pages. 160,000 words. 
	
	here's a quick glimpse at the 30 stories and novelettes in this latest collection: 
	
	when you're trapped by a blizzard in a deserted fort in the far north, what happens next when bugs with large eyes start climbing up the walls, and across the ceiling? if a young woman tells you she's a witch, should you really let her go inside your backyard chicken coop? what is digging tunnels under your grass, all of them headed towards your house? if a pack of dogs each have six legs, should you be concerned when they start following you? if after falling into the ocean out in the middle of nowhere you're rescued by a ship captained by a man who constantly wears a hood over his head, should you be worried? 
	
	your wife invites a co-worker she may be cheating on you with over for thanksgiving, and each slice you cut into the turkey breast reveals more and more small bones within the white meat. the woman you met at a bar can only flirt with you by passing you notes, because her tongue has been cut out. a distinguished plastic surgeon has had so many facelifts on his own face his face starts to slide on the underlying bones. the men's room you step into has no toilets, just wide pipes with open tops sticking up in the air. the monkey you and your wife coax down from your roof really likes chocolate ice cream. 
	
	why don't more people take out life insurance policies on high school children, since so many of them are likely to die fairly soon from car crashes or suicide? is it difficult living with a woman who doesn't have a head? why is the window-washer outside your office window exposing his genitals to you? what lives in the crevices formed by earthquakes? can you be friends with a neighbor who's had his human teeth replaced with canine teeth? 
	
	you're having breakfast at the local diner when everyone in town starts lifting up into the sky. you and your family are stuck in traffic in las vegas when a man on the sidewalk starts taunting you. your only chance to stop being homeless is to agree to be dropped by helicopter in the middle of a large field, and use the sponsor's lawnmower to mow a path to the sidewalk within so many minutes. you're studying to get your real estate license, but the red-haired boy in your backyard keeps trying to lure your challenged son outside. you're confident you can settle a dispute between your boyfriend, a respected chef, and a children's birthday party clown. 
	
	what do you do when your new job, out in the middle of nowhere, taking groups on tour, is interrupted by a lion? if the ground starts falling away from you and your girlfriend and her little sister, the dead down in the bottom of the ever-expanding trench following you, what's the best strategy? when your rowboat is attacked by fish, is the best decision to swim to the shore? what are the consequences when a wide sheet of glass starts sailing in the air down a busy city street? when a cat's head appears in your backyard, is it wise to follow its suggestions? 
	
	you want to stop all these endless relocations, but if you do, you know what will be waiting for you when you walk through the glass door with your bag of burgers and fries out into the mcdonald's parking lot. your life is such a mess you don't even notice the people hiding behind furniture in your home. the only way to not again spend time in jail is agreeing to be locked in a cage in an abandoned zoo. you made one assumption and it was wrong, then another assumption and that was also wrong, and now, naked, you're being chased by a chainsaw. sometimes, a person just drowns-or doesn't.

breathing through my nose documents eight cases in which donald duke entered someone's life.
"rrm always makes you think. no political correctness here." - des lewis, gestalt real-time reviews

roy took a deep breath. "there's something else." 
	
	"you want me to have your babies?" 
	
	"no." 
	
	her face registered hurt surprise that he didn't laugh at her joke. 
	
	"while we were making love? i felt a small lump in your breast." 
	
	she said nothing. tilted her coffee cup towards her, saw it was empty. "wait. what?" 
	
	"i felt a small lump in your breast." he pointed at her right breast. "is that something you're already aware of?" 
	
	she stared at him, eyes reddening. 
	
	"i didn't mention it at the time. for selfish reasons. and i thought maybe you already knew." 
	
	she slipped her left hand under the top of her blouse. 
	
	"do you want me to show you-" 
	
	"shut up." 
	
	he sat across from her at the small table, watching as her five fingers, underneath the front of her blouse, moved from one side of her right breast to the other. 
	
	anger and relief in her voice, she said, as her fingers kept pressing, "son of a fucking bitch, roy, if this is some kind of sick, fucking joke-" 
	
	her voice stopped. her fingers stopped. 
	
	her dark eyes looked across the table at him. 
	
	fingers moving again under her blouse. in one spot. 
	
	he could tell she was pressing against the lump with her fingertips, trying to gauge its submerged size, and to see if it was painful.

"we used to finish each other's sandwiches."
harry and edna are a middle-aged married couple who probably did love each other when they were young and just starting out, but now maybe don't any longer? or possibly still do, in some ways? it's so hard to tell sometimes, with people who have shared their lives for so many years.
harry, a big, angry, disappointed man with a sarcastic sense of humor, flips houses for a living in the greater dallas area, buying run-down homes, supervising his crew as they go in and renovate the properties, reviving them so they're once again a thing of beauty.
edna, his wife, has become increasingly promiscuous, and has had to undergo more and more invasive surgeries to try to eliminate an infection that has taken hold in her body.
the angry red planet is a sad, funny, scary exploration of the changing relationship between a man and a woman, and the daily social irritations that slowly grind them down, like they grind all of us down.

includes "dirt land", nominated in 2016 for best story of the year by the british fantasy society. 
children born with four feet. a man physically attached to three other men. a pushy waitress. a woman who dresses up as santa claus on halloween. an off-campus nyc 
	apartment overrun with tiny, crawling faces. a tomato with spikes sticking out of its red skin. a third rate stand-up comic who insists he isn't gay. a lonely 
	woman who constructs a tabletop village of miniature buildings wherever she moves. a widow who's visited by god in a dream, singing instructions to her about the structure he wants her to build. 
	a psychiatry student who has to convince a handcuffed serial rapist to sit on a toilet seat to reconnect with his childhood.

"up on the mountain, not everything that gets born is human. or at least, human enough. that's just the way it is. some of them are kept, if they look close enough, but a lot are taken down to the river before they get big, and drowned. shaken out of a blanket. if you go downstream, you'll find all kinds of dead babies bumping against the gray river rocks. stiff limbs, open mouths. getting picked at by fish. of course, up on the mountain, the people who live there catch that fish, like they catch all fish. fry it. eat it. that may be part of the problem."

the full text of father figure is now available in new trade paperback and kindle editions, with a 2015 author's preface, and an appendix 
	which includes 6,000 words in deleted scenes.
father figure is also available at all other amazon sites worldwide, and additional online venues. 175,000 words, plus 6,000 words of deleted scenes. 
	
	south of anchorage, accessible only from a mud-rutted road off seward highway, lies the town of lodgepole. after midnight, among the blueberry bushes of white birch park, a man climbs on top of a woman and begins making love to her. as her orgasm rises he puts his hands around her throat, shutting off her air. she struggles, not to stop him, but to stop herself from trying instinctively to pull his hands off her throat. as the top joints of his thumb meet at the front of her throat she comes, her cry of orgasm ricocheting around inside her forever.
daryl putnam, handsome, bookish, wakes up from a nightmare and decides to do something he hasn't done in years. take a walk outside at night. down in the park, at the lime green shores of little muncho lake, he comes across the body of the strangled woman.
the next morning, at the coffee shop of the hospital where he works, daryl meets sally, a pretty, dark-haired girl. he's intelligent, she's outgoing. what they have in common is both are living lonely lives. until today.
also in the hospital coffee shop, shaking half a can of black pepper onto his tomato soup, is sam rudolph, a fiftyish man with eyes like an angry dog's, who has spent over twenty years quietly manipulating events in daryl and sally's lives to have this seemingly chance encounter among the three of them occur.
and who is actually a lot older than fifty.
"it is easy to see why father figure has become an underground classic over the years. it is a dark, extremely disturbing but completely gripping suspense thriller with a strongly erotic subtext...moore is an extremely talented writer with a gift for pushing the reader's emotional buttons...certainly liable to become a cult classic, and deservedly so."
from an editorial review
"immensely readable and informed by a lucid intelligence, father figure belongs up there with the likes of delany's the mad man, bataille's story of the eye, sade's oeuvre, the story of o, and other works of transgressive literature that challenge our assumptions as what is normal and what goes beyond the pale."

if you're here, it's probably night. you can see a window from where you sit, and the window is dark. who really knows what's outside? 
	
	i write. if you read, we've just made a connection. 
	
	sentence is the forest you fall asleep into. 
	
	i created sentence back in 1998 as a way of letting readers know a little bit more about me. here you'll find about a dozen of my stories, the complete text of my novel father figure, essays of mine, videos i've made, photographs i've shot, 20 years of my on-line diary entries, some of my favorite recipes, and much, much more. i don't fear plagiarism. ideas can be stolen-- a simile, a description, a plot, a joke-- but that will happen regardless of the medium in which your luggage is left alone on the airport floor. the truth is, fear of plagiarism is fear of readership. to be plagiarized is never fatal. what is more important is to be read. because if it's in a box, and no one but you knows about the storms raging through the paragraphs, the footsteps plodding soggily down the sentences, water dripping off the rims of words, that's the biggest shame of all. a fizzle. because the real achievement of writing is not the writing. the real achievement of writing is someone else reading the writing. 
	
	sentence started as an island. over the years, its accumulated bulk, added to each month, became a continent. 
	
	art is an invitation to go inside someone else's mind. to see our world as they see it. sentence is my mind. 
	
	i've been published in america, canada, england, ireland, france, india and australia in a wide variety of genre and literary magazines and anthologies. i've been nominated twice for best story of the year by the british fantasy society, in 2013 and 2016. my fiction has been called "graphically morbid". my writings are not for everyone. are they for you? find out. 
	
	i'm glad you came. i just lit a cigarette. i just made a drink. i hope you enjoy your exploration. 
	
	and to see what i'm up to right now, and what currently interests me, visit my  page.
