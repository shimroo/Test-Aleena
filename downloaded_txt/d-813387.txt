what is truth? how do we know 
                        if we found the truth. there 
                        is one who created all things that can and will lead you 
                        into all the truth. seek after the the master and you 
                        will find him.


















jesus said, "i am the 
                                way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes 
                                to the father but through me. john 14:6 (nasb)


















"if you 
                        continue in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine; 
                        and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you 
                        free." john 8:31-32 (nasb) 














beloved, do not believe every 
                        spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from 
                        god, because many false prophets have gone out into the 
                        world. 1john 4:1 (nasb)
but the spirit explicitly says 
                        that in later times some will fall away from the faith, 
                        paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of 
                        demons, 1tim 4:2 (nasb) 














but realize this, that in the 
                        last days difficult times will come. for 
                        men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, 
                        arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, 
                        unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without 
                        self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, 
                        conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god, 
                        holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied 
                        its power. 2tim 3:2-5 (nasb)














the scripture states in 2cor 
                        11:4 there is one who"preaches another jesus" 
                        whom we have not preached, a"different spirit" 
                        which you have not received, a "different gospel" 
                        which you have not accepted.
















the purpose 
                          of this website is to expose the other jesus, the different 
                          spirit and the other gospel. also to compare what the 
                          scripture states against those who call themselves christians, 
                          but are false teachers. 

















and lastly the scripture 
                            states to contend earnestly for the faith, which was 
                            once for all handed down to the saints. jude 1:3 (nasb)
