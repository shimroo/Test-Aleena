building your
tables





tables are sort of a big deal. at them, great ideas happen and big decisions are made. if they’re not the centerpiece, they’re the noteworthy accent. they’re also where we work, play, collaborate, and share. that’s a lot of pressure on one piece of furniture.

luckily, building tables is what we do. and we’re really good at it. you’ve got gutsy ideas, and we have the means to make it happen. so let’s put that notion to the test.

                                      designed for a lifetime.




                                  

audrey was inspired by the early modernist ideal of a simple “platform” to support structure and personalized flexible elements. with the ability to easily change and evolve the design aesthetic, audrey celebrates materiality and clean, simple geometric form.

also influenced by children’s building blocks, it allows for easy reconfiguration based on evolving needs, ideas, and personal creativity. designed as a “kit of parts”, audrey can be installed, configured, and reconfigured without tools, using a common platform system that can grow and change.

given the flexibility and ease of reconfiguration, audrey helps to reduce waste when change is needed, and encourages creative applications with minimum impact, providing a lifetime of use.
