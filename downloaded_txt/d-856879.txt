my name is scott. i have a website. you're on it. 




all my life have i been fascinated by video games. i like to create them just as
        much as i like to play them! visit my game library to see three freeware games that
        i have developed over the past 20 years. these games include the world famous town
            hall toaster, as well as my newest creation, dinger finger!
