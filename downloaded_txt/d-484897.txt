what is online check-in?


                online check-in eliminates the need for your team to show up in person before your first game by allowing you to complete the check-in process online.
                you will be required to upload .pdf files or images to the secure sincsports cloud. 
                the event will determine which documents are required.
            





                you must scan documents or take digital photos to complete this process. 
            we will help you through the rest!
