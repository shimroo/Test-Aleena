life gets busy.rivers to fish, boats to build, kids to raise.go and explore what is just outside your door.â€‹we are continuing on our extended break for the near future. we appreciate those that stop by from time to time to see where things stand. maybe someday we'll kick start this site up again. until that time please continue to support your local fly shops, conservation causes, and be a good steward to the natural resources all around us.
