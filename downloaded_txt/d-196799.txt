have you been affected by a problem drinker?
did you grow up with drinking in your home?
 al-anon/alateen is:



a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who believe their lives have been affected by someone else’s drinking.
a self-help recovery program based on the twelve steps of alcoholics anonymous (aa).
a nonprofessional fellowship where members share their experience and hope to solve their common problem.
an anonymous program with the identity of all al-anon, alateen and aa members protected.
a spiritual program that is compatible with all religious beliefs or none.
a program with the single purpose of helping families and friends of alcoholism whether the alcoholic is still drinking or not.
compatible with professional treatment. statistics show 63% of members received treatment/counseling after attending al-anon.
free of charge and self-supporting through members’ voluntary contributions. there are no dues or fees for membership.





what does al-anon and alateen do?
just as aa offers a new way of life to the alcoholic, al-anon and alateen offer the adventure of a new way of life to the alcoholic’s family and friends. meetings are devoted to understanding our own problems. over time the al-anon and alateen program shows us how to cope with our difficulties and we find a more serene approach to life.
