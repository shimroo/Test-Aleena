~andy clowerwe visited several that have infill made from reground tires, and we found that the mondoturf ecofill field was far superior. even on a hot day in texas, we couldn't feel the heat through our shoes on the mondoturf ecofill field like we did on other fields. plus, the mondoturf monofilament fibers felt closest to natural grass of all the fields we evaluated. it's a tremendous total system. i have no doubt that we chose the best artificial turf field available.
karl costello, director physical welfarestudents love (the mondoturf field). one of the great things about mondo is that it is a top performer, even on hot days and in rainfall. students know they are playing on a professional-quality surface.
diane dahlmann, director services and facilitiesthis is without a doubt the best turf we've ever played on. it's the best artificial surface out there because it is the closest to natural grass.
derek burton, head women's soccer coachwe evaluated several companies before deciding to go with mondo. as a division i school, we wanted our athletes to have the best surface available for training and competition, and mondotrack was the obvious choice - it's the fastest and most durable track in the world.
 brad teague, director of athleticswe continue to be impressed with the mondo surface at the university of arkansas. it has been extremely durable. after five years of nearly daily use, the mondo surface is in great shape.
chris bucknam, track and field head coachwe extensively researched all available options for use in our new student life center sports complex. at the end of the day nothing compared to kiefer usa and mondo. we are excited to open our new facility with what we believe is the finest and most reputable sports surface on the market today
mike mcdowell - track & field coachafter 20 years of hard use, it was simply time to replace our previous mondo surface. we considered installing a poured surface, but we returned to the fact that we'd always had a very good experience with mondo and the mondo surface.
