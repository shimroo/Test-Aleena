i got to start playtesting an unreleased mmorpg today. the game itself was fun, even if kinda unremarkable (certainly nothing people here would go crazy for), but i was honestly most amazed by walking into the office and seeing a bunch of framed posters of iconic games the company tested ranging from sonic titles to rayman and for honor to mirrors edge and even more.

think the funniest thing to come from the nasb games is when nick (and seemingly the devs) didn't realize a ren & stimpy adult party cartoon reference had snuck its way into their game.
