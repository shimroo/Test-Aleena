the perfect career
how many of us have either fallen into our less-than-satisfying jobs, taken the safe route in some way rather than what we really wanted to do, or taken a job out of a need to pay the bills? have

leadership provides purpose, direction & takes action
a strong company is one that has leaders spread all across the company, not just at the top. the business world today needs both  good leaders and good managers. however, because of the rapid change
occurring in industry today, a company needs far more leaders, not more managers.
