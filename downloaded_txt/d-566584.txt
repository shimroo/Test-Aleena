natural surfaces





welcome to my personal blog and/or notebook about surface design and stitch!  here i will be posting about my personal journey and challenges for 2014.  some of this surface design may not be about natural dyeing, as many of you know i also work with fabric paints such as setacolor, inks, oil bars (shiva paintstiks), etc. in addition natual dyes, see photo. 




cutch dyed cotton fabric, fabric paint, shiva paintstiks, acrylic ink, machine stitched. 

currently i'm working mostly with digital printed fabric, now tha twinter is here i will be working in my wet studio once again dyeing fabric with natural dyes.

march 4th challenge





birds of a feather is this weeks challenge, interpet as you will! the robins have returned here, even if it did snow on sonday and is threatening to snow again tomorrow.  i"m feeling spring deficient at the moment, but with daylight savings time arriving this weekend maybe i'll get more light and feel more lively.http://www.naturalsurfaces.blogspot.comkimberly

february 26th challenge





oooops i forgot to do this yesterday! somehow i missed a few days in my week.this weeks challenge is all about spring, spring green!!! with st. patrick's day coming up i thought i could get a jumpstart on everything green by dyeing my fabric with osage orange and then overdyeing with indigo.  my vat has survived the winter and quite well, of course it lives in my wet studio which is in the basement so that does help.

rust and red challenge piece





rust dyed over setacolor paints, i am in love with a color called bengal pink! i especially like the way it looks with the penrod yellow (or is it penrod green?) regardless it's a most excellent combination. i'm not sure what i will do with this piece yet, probably piece it with some hand-dyed fabrics.i should have the other two challenge pieces ready to photograph tomorrow.
