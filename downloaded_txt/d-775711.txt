in their own words
family history, including diaries, letters, memoirs, photographs and much more are shared with others.  as explained in the soon to be opened research lab (link to the right) i am available to help with research, for free and for fee depending on what is required.




far from home: the diary of lt. william h. peel, 1863-1865
the diary includes peel's vivid account of the confederates' final charge at gettysburg, as well as an often witty picture of his life in the officers' prison at johnson's island, oh.  the diary is printed in its entirety along with informative articles and footnotes, additional annotation and photographs.  it is a chance to experience the civil war's darkest hours through the eyes of one young man.

coming soon
