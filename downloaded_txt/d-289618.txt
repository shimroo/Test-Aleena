adventure is out there.      this is your invitation.














"you can hurt more than you ever thought possible, then continue until you discover that hurting isn't that big a deal."               - scott jurek
























trek.
it’s not trail running and it’s not hiking. some call it the ar shuffle and if you’re really lucky you might call it a death march.  you may be on trail but more than likely, you will be in a swamp, dense forest, or a vast ridgeline.  wherever you are, keep your compass ready and your teamates close!



 











paddle.
first rule of paddling: never lose the paddle. second rule of paddling: navigation is harder than you think! whether a canoe, kayak, packraft, or anything else a race might throw at you, this is the discipline that separates the field between beginners and seasoned racers.  don’t underestimate the value of training for paddling.















bike.
yes it’s mountain biking but it’s not all smooth lines and flowing single track.  do you know what hike-a-bike means? well, we promise you will.  26, 29 or 27.5,  full suspension or hardtail; adventure racing is the great equalizer for mountain biking because at some point you will be pushing that bike.















navigate.
navigation is the cornerstone discipline of adventure racing.  both veterans and newcomers alike will make or break their race by the decisions they make on course. remember, it doesn’t matter how fast you are if you’re going in the wrong direction. 
















 

"the reason we race isn't so much to beat each other...but to be with each other."                -chris mcdougall
