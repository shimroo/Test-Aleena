a little 
            note from miss joy from the joy house
            "i would to thank those who have believed and continue to believe 
            in this huge dream called the joy house. which is basically to help 
            build postive self esteem, good work ethics, discilpline, creativity 
            in kids and teach them how to dream and feel special about themselves 
            via all forms of multi - media and get it out to all children of the 
            world.
            to do what you love and love what you do is the essence to happiness.
            the joy house will be a vehicle to help, teach, motivate, guide and 
            inspire to dream.
so hopefully one day kids 
            will bring "the feeling of feeling good about themselves" 
            into their adult lives by staying out of trouble and becoming self 
            sufficient people who contribute something positive and productive 
            in this messed up world which we live in today...
            it is getting worse and the kids are the future and we are their teachers
            we artists, parents and teachers are their role models" miss 
            joy 1999 
it is 
            simple .......... give joy, get joy!
