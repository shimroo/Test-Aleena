about magazineline:


                in 1974 our founder and ceo, irv lesher, wanted to give college students a break. he believed that giving them a discount on magazine subscriptions 
                would benefit both the students and the magazine publishers. he was right! and so our parent company, american collegiate marketing, was born.
            

                today, we sell discounted magazine subscriptions online to students, teachers, and just about everyone in the usa, and our commitment to superior 
                service is stronger than ever. our call center is still located in our company headquarters, right down the hall from the president/ceo. 
                we work directly with publishers to ensure fast and accurate delivery. we're proud to say we've helped over 5 million americans save a billion dollars
