best filipino style coffee shop















i noticed this coffee shop when i took the dapitan jeep to libertad going home. it was high noon then and the shop had very few customers then.i reviewed mamang taho and i loved them. i was all praises on the fact that they were the first to intoduce taho as a restaurant product and as an ingredient to many new drinks that kept us coming for more (i did).the innovation of mamang taho coffee shop was the greatest i've ever heard of and i do look forward to coming to mt often in the future and would bring more and more friends, switching them from the mechanical coffee of starbucks to the exciting coffee of mamang taho.
