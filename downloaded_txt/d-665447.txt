2024-25 rankings
2024-25 high school page
your host in 2020
lots of changes this year compared to past years when it comes to post season for washington high school wrestling in the 2024-25 season.  this year there will be no regional tournaments, as we have always had, but instead we will be taking wrestlers that qualify in their district directly to state with a 32 man bracket.  there will be a 2 week gap between districts and the mat classic and the classic will be held over three days instead of the usual two.  the wswa folkstyle state championships will take place at the same t-dome location, the day after the mat classic finishes.  this will be a busy 4 days for some folks!
i will be setting up a link here that will take you the mat classic brackets when we get to that point.  the same will occur for the districts.  rankings will be updated after this weekend, in the divisions that can.  we have had some challenges this year with time constraints for a couple of my rankers and that affects three different divisions, boys 2a, 3a and 4a.   i hope that will change over the next couple of weeks but sometimes people have things out of their control that affects things.  boys b and 1a are updated and all of the girls have been updated.
links to wiaa info on districts and classifications are just below.  i hope this info will help in seeing how the post-season will be happening this year.  for information on district make up click here and for a list of teams in the different classification click here.

brackets are located on the high school page.  the rankings page link is at the top of this page along with a link to the high school page for 2023-24.  remember to have tournament directors email the completed brackets of their tournaments to be posted on the site and to be reviewed for ranking changes.  also remember to email any input on rankings to me at info@washingtonwrestlingreport.net so i can analyze them and then forward them to all the pertinent rankers for review on a class by class basis.
once the high school season gets underway the brackets and rankings will  being updated regularly.  as always, feel free to comment on the rankings on the message board as the rankers do read those and use the information in addition to what they are able to review from the data on the wwr web site.
to see  quick update of which rankings have been updated simply go to the “categories” drop down arrow in the upper right hand of the screen right over the ads on the right.  click the arrow and chose “rankings” and it will lists all the rankings by most recent date.  try it and let me know what you think on the message board.
hard to believe but it seems that not everyone in wrestling is aware of this site and the effort we make as a group to get the information in one central location for all the wrestling fans to see.  we need folks to write down my email address (info@washingtonwrestlingreport.net) and make sure they hand it to the tournament directors at all tournaments and ask them to email the completed brackets to us for posting.  the more people we have talking to the administrators that have the data, the more results we will see on the site.  keep the requests going so we can all see what’s happening!
“character is the type of person you are when no one is around”
 “the final measure of one’s life won’t be how well you live, but how well others live because of you”
the difference between commitment and interest: “commitment is making the time to do what is necessary. interest is doing what is necessary if you have the time. there’s a vast difference.”  by lou sportelli, d.c.
