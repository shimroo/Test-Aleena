our goal
as fellow collectors, our goal is to further the collectibility of these beautiful items by educating collectors about the history of the pieces as well as providing information on the current secondary market.

our research
the product information we provide is collected from a variety of sources. we are not directly associated with the different manufacturers so while we have a very good relationship with each, we spend a great deal of time collecting the information from both public and private resources.
the market values provided are also from various resources in the secondary market. some are based on actual selling transactions that are reported to us or collected through collectors, dealers, auctioneers and the like. other more rare items which are harder to find actual transactions for are evaluated based on the supply and the demand in the secondary market for each item. for each update provided, hundreds of hours are logged and thousands of transactions are reviewed to provide as accurate of a view of the market as possible.

how it works
once you choose to subscribe and go through the registration process, you will be given a login id and password to access your account. collectibles database online is a web-based service so there is nothing to install and nothing to ‘save’ to your computer.   it is accessible from every device that has access to the internet and is accessible on both pc and mac platforms. there are no compatibility or memory requirements outside of what is required for you to access the internet.  
the ‘values + inventory’ service is an annual subscription and is automatically renewed unless cancelled prior to renewal.
the ‘values only’ service is limited to the number of values that are purchased and does not have the ability to create an inventory or run reports.
