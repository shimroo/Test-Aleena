if collecting records is compared to collecting stamps
    then 45s are the definitives. indeed, it was the 45 r.p.m record
    that helped the music industry define popular music culture.
here at www.45rpm.org.uk is a wealth of information about
    the songs and artists that appeared on uk issued 45s during the
    1950s and 1960s. the content of this website grows regularly
    so don't forget to add it to your favourites list, even if you
    don't find what you want today.







 



on this site are specially featured some of the records to
    appear in the uk when that wonderful 7 inch vinyl format was
    still young. i've selected those that i think had the greatest
    influence on the genre called 'pop'- you may not agree- together
    with a few of particular interest. why not tell me what records
    i should feature? i might be persuaded to add them...
