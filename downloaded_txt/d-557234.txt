beginners lessons 
bridgedoctor has everything you need to learn how to play bridge online. like many bridge websites we have text lessons on how to play contract bridge. these lessons are listed below, however what makes bridgedoctor different from many other websites is that here you can also play bridge against the computer. for beginners, playing against the computer is a great way to practice and learn to play bridge. when you play bridge against the computer there are no time constraints, you can take as much time as you like to play each hand. you can review the previous tricks and review all the cards played at the end of the game. when you gain more confidence you can join our competition ladder and rank yourself against other bridge players. there are still no time constraints when playing on our ladder as you are still playing against the computer. 
          
there is no need to download and install any software, our game runs in your web browser.
