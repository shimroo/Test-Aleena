to illuminate and advance greater understanding of and support for wabanaki nations’ heritage, living cultures, and homelands.

  

in recent years, the abbe has grown from a small trailside museum, privately operated within acadia national park, to an exciting contemporary museum in the heart of downtown bar harbor. in 2013, the museum became the first and only smithsonian affiliate in the state of maine. at the abbe's downtown museum, visitors find dynamic and stimulating exhibitions and activities interspersed with spaces for quiet reflection. the history and cultures of the native people in maine, the wabanaki, are showcased through changing exhibitions, special events, teacher workshops, archaeology field schools, and workshops for children and adults. from spring through fall, the abbe's historic trailside museum at sieur de monts spring continues to offer visitors a step back in time to early 20th century presentations of native american archaeology in maine.“the museum is heartfelt, accessible, and has something for all visitors but doesn’t shy away from telling the hard truths of the past and present. we are all involved in the process of making the world better. thank you for the opportunity to learn and appreciate, to recognize beauty and work, and the unity of all things.” —emma, 2018

the abbe museum acknowledges indigenous land.we are in the homeland of the wabanaki, the people of the dawn. we extend our respect and gratitude to the many indigenous people and their ancestors whose rich histories and vibrant communities include the abenaki, maliseet, micmac, passamaquoddy, and penobscot nations and all of the native communities who have lived here for thousands of generations in what is known today as maine, new england, and the canadian maritimes. we make this acknowledgment aware of continual violations of water, territorial rights, and sacred sites in the wabanaki homeland. the abbe is honored to collaborate with the wabanaki as they share their stories.
