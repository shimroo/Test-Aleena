if we help one, they can help thousands!



in 2014, an idea of helping children by renting condos and donating half of the rental income to fund surgeries for children, has since turned into, not only assisting surgeries, but also, supplying food, educational needs, medical needs, as well as christian camps for children around the globe. the funding of the condos remains private, and is not tied to any funding received from donations. the private condos provide a stability to the organization to fund fixed costs, so the donations received  can go directly to help the children in need around the globe. 









condos for kids international provides assistance around the world

condos for kids international helps children in developing countries, as well as children in need in developed countries. we assist with medical expenses to help the children have access to doctors. this helps to increase the chance for adoptions.  in some locations, we also assist with camps for the children, supplying food when the homes are needing supplements, and also helping with the education of children.
we are a non-profit and your donation is tax deductible!

helping kids when they need it most.

many children come to the care homes as an entire family, they are to stay as a family unit when they are adopted.   if one child has a large medical expense it can stop a family unit from adopting the children, due to the costs for helping the one child. 

our charitable organization helps to connect doctors with the children that need medical assistance. many children are in need of medical care. however, the funds at the care facilities is not enough to fix the difficult cases. the children are able to be adopted yet the medical expenses can overwhelm the families that are adopting the children, thus preventing some of the children from being adopted due to the expenses alone.
