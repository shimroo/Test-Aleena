the pittsburgh district provides expertise to help the region and the nation meet water resources development, environmental and other engineering needs.
the u.s. army corps of engineers' involvement in works “of a civil nature” dates back almost to the origins of the united states. over the years, as the nation’s needs have changed, so have the army’s civil works missions. those missions today fall into four broad areas:
 - water infrastructure
 - environmental management and restoration
 - response to natural and man-made disasters
 - engineering and technical services

missions in each of these areas support the army, department of defense and other federal, state and local agencies.


delivering integrated regional solutions that minimize risk and enhance reliability for the nation’s infrastructure, water resources and environment.
maintaining a team of multi-functional professionals poised to face the challenges of the future.


the pittsburgh district has developed expertise to accomplish its varied civil works missions in the areas of navigation, flood-damage reduction, recreation, environmental restoration, hydropower, storm-damage reduction, regulatory, water supply and emergency response with more than 140 years of experience. our jurisdiction includes more than 328 miles of navigable waterways, 23 navigation locks and dams, 16 multi-purpose flood-damage reduction reservoirs, 42 local-flood damage-reduction projects and other projects to protect and enhance water resources and wetlands.  
like all corps' civil works districts, the pittsburgh district’s boundaries are defined by the watershed basins for which we are responsible. pittsburgh’s 26,000 square miles include portions of western pennsylvania, northern west virginia, eastern ohio, western maryland and southwestern new york.  
the pittsburgh district is known as the headwaters district because it includes the upper 127 miles of the ohio river and the drainage basins of the allegheny and monongahela rivers which join at the point in pittsburgh to form the ohio river. additionally, “headwaters” acknowledges pittsburgh’s role as a district of 'engineering firsts' within the corps of engineers.


our people: valued and productive
our organization: effective and efficient
our customers: valued and satisfied
our future: integrated solutions to local, national and global challenges


environmental restoration
our region’s strong industrial past has served the nation well but has extracted a high environmental cost.  congress has given the corps of engineers legislative authorities to carry out environmental missions.
environmental stewardship
environmental stewardship has become an integral part of the corps’ work ethic and its roots extend back into history. the corps of engineers was the first federal agency to exercise environmental management over the areas that became yellowstone and yosemite national parks. while this tradition may have been overshadowed by the national pro-development push of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, today’s corps takes a strong approach to protect the environment.
the district’s responsibilities in this area are to maintain technical and professional expertise to assist the nation in fulfilling the objectives of the national environmental policy act and other laws protecting environmental, cultural, historic, and wildlife resources. district efforts include water quality monitoring at all corps projects; participation with other agencies in fish sampling on the allegheny, monongahela and ohio rivers; cultural, historical, biological and archeological surveys at proposed construction sites and existing projects; wildlife and natural resource management plans at the reservoirs; and a variety of public education programs.
infrastructure rehabilitation
it is possible you have noticed the corps of engineers logo while boating on one of the pittsburgh district’s three rivers, or during a picnic at a nearby lake. the pittsburgh district not only builds, but operates and maintains the infrastructure of locks and dams and multi-purpose reservoirs that provide local flood protection, navigation corridors, recreation and water quality improvement to our region.
section 14 of the flood control act of 1946 enables the corps of engineers to restore and protect eroded stream banks and shorelines that threaten the structural integrity of public works or non-profit public facilities.  examples of these works include highways, municipal water supply systems, treatment plants, sewer and water lines, hospitals, schools, fire companies, churches and libraries.
the corps can also play a role in helping local communities to construct new, improve existing, or expand water-related environmental infrastructure. section 313 of the water resources development act of 1992 authorizes the corps of engineers to provide support to communities for projects like waste water treatment and related facilities; water supply; storage, treatment, and distribution facilities; and surface water resource projection and development in 21 counties of south central pennsylvania.
section 219 of the water resources development act of 1992, as amended, authorizes the corps to provide environmental infrastructure assistance to other areas of southwestern pennsylvania.  funding under this program has been received each year since 2002 for work in allegheny county.
section 594 of the water resources development act of 1999 authorizes an environmental infrastructure and resource protection and development program for the state of ohio.  funding has been received under this program to prepare a program management plan, to develop model project cooperation agreements and to initiate a number of projects.
local protection
in additional to its reservoirs, the pittsburgh district has constructed 42 local flood protection projects.  these projects are designed to provide protection for heavily developed residential, business and industrial areas with a history of flood problems. 
such projects typically consist of stream bank protection, dredging, flood walls, drop structures, debris basins and levees. once construction is completed, these projects are generally turned over to a local sponsor for operation and maintenance. the district and the local sponsor periodically inspect the project to insure it is still capable of providing the protection for which it was designed.
three local protection projects within the pittsburgh district hold a unique status in that the corps retains responsibility for their operation and maintenance. these unique projects are located in johnstown, pennsylvania; punxsutawney, pennsylvania; and elkins, west virginia.
flood damages within the pittsburgh district are controlled by both structural and non-structural methods. non-structural flood warning systems with the cheat and tygart river basins in west virginia are innovative early-warning systems designed to save lives and protect property by providing advance warning of flood crests. ice jam related flooding is being controlled at oil city, pennsylvania with uniquely designed ice control structures on oil creek and the allegheny river.
support for others
the district’s support for others program provides technical and management services to federal, state and local agencies who do not have the in-house capability to meet their needs for specified activities, or who are interested in combining their resources with the corps – creating a partnership to support various needs/projects.
current/previous support for others work provided to:  environmental protection agency, federal emergency management agency, housing & urban development, military, national energy technology laboratory, national park service, natural resource conservation service, office of surface mining, panama canal commission and the tennessee valley authority.

the pittsburgh district is merely one of many districts of the corps of engineers, united states army, that direct water resource development and performed other assigned missions throughout the world; yet, it is proper for many reasons to refer to the installation at pittsburgh as the “headwaters district.” at pittsburgh, british and french army engineers first met in combat, launching the french and indian war; and from pittsburgh, american frontier engineers staged their campaigns during the revolution to secure the ohio and mississippi basins for the united states. here, army engineers began their explorations of the american west, and here, the pioneers boarded their frail craft to begin their voyages to new homes on the frontiers. a reminder of those events is the fact that distances along the ohio river are measured not in miles above the mouth of the stream, as on other rivers, but in miles below pittsburgh…
the pittsburgh district was the home of the pioneer marine engineers and waterways shippers. here were built the first flatboats, keelboats, and steamboats; here the first barges and towboats were built. the district was the cradle of american inland river commerce.
it was natural therefore that the improvement of inland river navigation should begin at pittsburgh. here, the army engineers undertook their first experiments with waterways improvement engineering, clearing snags and constructing dams in 1824 to open river channels for reliable commerce. so many innovative waterways engineering methods were tried and tested in the pittsburgh district that it became the empirical “experiment station” for the entire inland rivers system. pittsburgh was the “headwaters district” for waterways navigation engineering.
it was at pittsburgh that the great political and engineering controversies over flood control methods began and were fought out during the twentieth century. to find the origins of the modern multipurpose water resource development mission of the corps of engineers, one must look to the history of the pittsburgh district.
in the history of the pittsburgh district, one also finds many firsts in military construction engineering, - in the engineering of aerospace facilities ranging from biplane aerodromes to moon rockets, and in the multitude of other missions assigned to the corps of engineers during the past two centuries. in sum, the district has been the site of so many “firsts” that it clearly is the “headwaters district.”

-- dr. leland r. johnson, historian
(excerpted from author’s preface, “the headwaters district, a history of the pittsburgh district, u.s. army corps of engineers,” 1978)








what we do
allegheny river locks and dams
monongahela river locks and dams
ohio river locks and dams



navigation systems across the united states significantly contributed to the growth and economic prosperity of our nation. for centuries, settlers in the upper ohio river basin used the system of rivers in the pittsburgh region to expand commerce and industrial enterprise. in 1824, congress tasked the corps of engineers with improving navigation on the ohio river. 
dedicated in 1885, davis island lock and dam, was the first of 53 ohio river locks and dams, built over a 44 year period, descending from pittsburgh to cairo, illinois. in 1893, the corps opened a permanent office in pittsburgh with the mission of improving navigation on the allegheny and monongahela rivers. today, pittsburgh district’s navigation system includes 23 locks and dams on the allegheny, monongahela and ohio rivers. 
to support this system, the district also operates a major warehouse and repair facility located on neville island, housing a repair fleet responsible for major maintenance work on the locks and dams. eight locks and dams on the allegheny river provide 72 miles of slack-water navigation from the point at pittsburgh to above east brady, pennsylvania. nine locks and dams on the monongahela river maintain navigable waters for the entire 128.7 miles of the river from just above fairmont, west virginia to the point at pittsburgh. six locks and dams on the ohio river provide navigable waters from the point at pittsburgh for 127.2 miles of the river downstream to new martinsville, west virginia.
the three rivers that make up the port of pittsburgh are used to carry raw materials, bulk and manufactured goods for many industries in the region. the port of pittsburgh is the second-busiest inland port and the second-busiest port of any kind in the nation.

when a storm hits, multi-purpose flood-control reservoirs built and maintained by the corps of engineers retain excess water upstream of the dam. controlled releases of this excess water prevent or reduce downstream flooding. without the corps' reservoirs, the flood of january 1996 would have raised the crest at the point in pittsburgh by 9.7 feet, and during the september 2004 flooding from hurricane ivan, the crest at the point of 31.1 feet would have been 7.7 feet higher.
as the headwaters district, pittsburgh has played a key role in the evolvement of the corps of engineers’ flood damage reduction mission. part of that role is directly related to the region’s history of major floods. local and state efforts to find solutions to local and regional flooding prompted congressional debate on a national flood control role. devastation from the 1936 st. patrick’s day flood provided the impetus to pass the omnibus flood control act of 1936 assigning that mission to the corps of engineers.
since then, the pittsburgh district has constructed a system of 16 flood control reservoirs and 42 local protection projects that have returned more than $20 in flood damages prevented for every $1 invested. regional sources estimate that the district’s flood control reservoirs prevented more than $14 billion of damages and 42 of its local flood protection projects prevented more than $2.6 billion of damages since their construction.


water quality management is an integral part of corps' civil works missions. the pittsburgh district, as stewards of federal lands and the environment, complies with the mandates of the clean water act and other laws and regulations to enhance the physical, biological and chemical integrity of our nation’s waters. we conduct field surveys and operate a real-time monitoring network to assess existing water quality conditions at our reservoirs and navigation locks and dams, track trends, operate reservoirs for optimum downstream benefits and identify and implement aquatic ecosystem restoration initiatives.
although specific for each site, the primary purposes for our reservoirs include flood control, low flow augmentation, water supply, water quality, navigation, recreation and conservation of fish and wildlife. approximately 90 percent of our total reservoir storage is dedicated to water quality. by manipulating flows, we can substantially benefit downstream water quality.

what we do
assistance we provide
assistance criteria



the corps of engineers provides emergency assistance under public law 84-99 to save lives and protect improved property (i.e., public facilities and services, residential or commercial developments) during flooding or coastal storms. the corps also reconstructs levees damaged in flood events. assistance to individual homeowners and businesses is not permitted. corps operations are federally funded, but the corps has no authority to reimburse states or local communities for their efforts. the corps provides support to other agencies, particularly the federal emergency management agency (fema), under public law 93-288.



assistance in search and rescue operations.
emergency construction of, or repairs to, levees or other flood protection projects.
hiring of contractors and equipment for flood fighting, construction of levees, etc.
providing flood fighting materials (i.e. sandbags, sandbag machines, plastic sheeting, pumps, etc.)
technical advice and assistance on flood fighting.
removal of stream obstructions or bridge opening blockages.




flooding must be occurring. urban or residential areas only.
a declaration of a state of emergency or a written request from the governor of the state or from a local official is required. the request must detail state and local commitments and identify the specific needs and types of assistance requested.
emergency operations assistance is meant to be temporary in nature and will be in support of state and local ongoing or planned efforts. non-federal interests must commit all available resources (i.e., manpower, supplies, equipment, funds, etc.)
the request must be technically feasible and economically justified.
the state must agree to furnish all assurances of local cooperation and indemnification of the united states.

the department of the army regulatory program is one of the oldest in the federal government. initially it served a fairly simple, straightforward purpose: to protect and maintain the navigable capacity of the nation's waters. time, changing public needs, evolving policy, case law, and new statutory mandates have changed the complexion of the program, adding to its breadth, complexity, and authority. the regulatory program is committed to protecting the nation's aquatic resources, while allowing reasonable development through fair, flexible and balanced permit decisions. the corps evaluates permit applications for essentially all construction activities that occur in the nation's waters, including wetlands.
the corps of engineers has been involved in regulating certain activities in the nation’s waters since 1899. initially, the primary driver of the corps’ regulatory program was the protection of navigation.  passage of the clean water act in 1972, greatly broadened this role. today, work in navigable waters ,or depositing dredge or fill materials in waters of the united states, including wetlands, requires a permit from the corps of engineers.
in making decisions on whether to grant, deny or set conditions on permits, the pittsburgh district considers the full range of environmental and socio-economic factors.
the permit process varies depending on the project’s complexity, location and effect on the environment. anyone who is planning work related environments such as lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, and ponds within the pittsburgh district’s regulatory boundaries should contact our regulatory department to determine federal jurisdiction, ask questions or submit a permit application.

planning
key projects



planning is a structured, rational approach to solving problems that requires experience, analysis, intuition, inspiration and collaboration. planners help decision makers identify problems, develop solutions, and consider the importance of the conflicting values inherent in any solution.
planning plays a vital role in supporting the u.s. army corps of engineers' civil works water resources development mission in the pittsburgh district. members of a corps planning team are professionals with expertise in water resources planning, including plan formulation, environmental evaluation, cultural resources evaluation, civil works policy, and public involvement.
in addition to possessing knowledge, skills and insights, corps planners seek input from the public (homeowners, businesses, environmental advocates, native american tribes and interest groups) and agencies (federal, state, regional and local) to arrive at a solution for a water resource issue. examples of water resource issues include flooding, degraded ecosystems, streambank erosion and stormwater management.
the pittsburgh district can assist local communities with large or small water resource issues.

points of interest
     the pittsburgh district attempts to solicit all requirements for commodities, services, and construction between the $2,500 and $100,000 range by computer through army single face to industry (asfi) and fedbizopps.
     all competitive requirements over $25,000 that are not deemed suitable for an asfi solicitation are published by the fedbizopps (federal business opportunities) . each notice of a proposed procurement is published only once, so it is important to check the fedbizopps regularly.
     contract and bid information is also available at the pittsburgh district contracting branch office located on the 22d floor of the william s. moorhead federal building, room 2203, 1000 liberty avenue, pittsburgh, pa 15222.
eft and ccr requirements
     all contractors/vendors doing business with department of defense (dod) agencies must be registered with central contractor registration (ccr). after may 30, 1998, firms not registered in ccr will be unable to receive dod awards. to obtain registration forms, call the central contractor registration assistance center at (888) 227-2423. firms may also register on-line via the internet on the ccr website. it is mandatory that all contracts contain provisions for electronic fund transfer (eft) with few exceptions.

micro-purchases
     to streamline the procurement process, the pittsburgh district utilizes the government credit card for micro-purchases (purchases of $2,500 and less). the card is an internationally accepted visa credit card issued by us bank system, and bears the legend "for official government use."
american recovery and reinvestment act (arra)
     recipients that received contracts with arra funds are subject to recipient reporting. all recipients will report via www.federalreporting.gov. training is available at this website on the information required and how to file the reports.
important notice
     the department of defense has mandated that paperless contracting be in place for all acquisition types. therefore, vendors are encouraged to be capable of accepting government credit cards and subscribe to asfi / fedbizopps to maximize business opportunities.
