land acknowledgementdurham college is situated on the traditional lands of the first peoples of the mississaugas of scugog island first nation. these lands are covered under the williams treaties and rest within the traditional territory of the anishinaabeg. we offer our gratitude to the indigenous peoples who care for and, through the treaty process, share the lands on which we live, learn, teach and prosper today.
