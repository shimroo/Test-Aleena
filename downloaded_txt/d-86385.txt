"the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly
been considered,
as the palladium of the liberties of the republic;
since it offers a strong moral check against usurpation and arbitrary
power of the rulers;
and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance,
enable the people to resist and triumph over them."
—justice joseph story, commentaries on the constitution (1833)
