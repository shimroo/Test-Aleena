favela rising brazil (final version) by douglas giovany

  this map has been featured as a custom map on axis3000 over many saturdays. 

  its proved so popular it has been adopted as a standard. this is one of the 

  classic ctf maps, very well thought out - i could play it for hours. 10/10.

this is the long awaited release of the ultimate sof2 demo viewer by infrequent. refrag soon became an essential tool for sof2 movie makers and you will see it in the credits of all the best sof2 videos. refrag2 is the new improved version with even more features and a much improved user interface. refrag2 is not just a tool for movie makers though, it's also an excellent stand alone demo player that lets you analyse every players move from every angle.unfortunately refrag2 does not support v1.00 but if you play sof2 gold this 
	is a must have tool.

playing sof2 v1.00

		some time ago when re-installing sof2 and before adding the gold patch to bring my 3 year old cd up to date, i noticed there were lots of servers still running version 1.00 i decided to do a duplicate sof2 installation in a second folder on my pc, but running v1.00. i have to say its like another dimension with many hundreds of players never seen on the gold version. you can add v1.00 in about 4 minutes, why not give it a try:) there are more people playing rmg than on gold!!

playing sof2 v1.03some months after sof2 was launched a number of modifications were made to the original game which included bug fixes, new weapons, punkbuster anti cheat software and additional maps. this update, called the gold patch changed your original game to v1.03. it was intended to replace to 1.00 version but if you make a copy of your original v1.00 files before applying the patch you can still play both versions.
