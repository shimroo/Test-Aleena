getting started is easy
step 1: select country
use the dropdown tool below and find the country you wish to call. there are 200+ destinations for you to choose from.
step 2: select card
once youâ€™ve selected the country you wish to call, our tool will find you the best phone cards for that specific destination.
step 3: start calling
after purchase, youâ€™ll receive your calling card via email with instructions on how to call your friends and family abroad!
why phone card selector?
get your phone card via email
in the early 2000â€™s we used to physically post our phone cards out to our customers.
these days we only send our phone cards via email, this helps you to start making calls sooner.
the best part is that once you receive your digital phone card thereâ€™s nothing for you to activate, simply make your first call!
no hidden fees or contracts
itâ€™s common practice for phone card providers to charge additional fees to their customers but at phone card selector weâ€™ve waived any hidden charges so you can make calls so you donâ€™t need to worry about the real cost of your calls.
australian based customer support
no more hours on hold or communication barriers. our local sydney-based support teams are ready to help, even on public holidays. get prompt, knowledgeable assistance tailored to your needs.
enjoy a seamless customer experience and focus on what really matters.
how to dial overseas using our phone cards
step 1: dial the access number
dial the local access number in the area that you are in from your mobile or landline (the local access numbers are printed on the email that we send you after you order)
step 2: key in your pin number
you will then hear a computerized voice that will ask you for your pin. punch the pin in on your telephone keypad and the voice will then tell you how much money you have in your phone card account
step 3: dial the international number
next, dial the destination number:
for overseas calls, dial:
0011 + country code + area code + local number + [ # ]
for std calls, dial:
area code + local number + [ # ]

what is a phonecard?
a phonecard is a service that allows you to make cheap international calls. phone cards are often delivered by email but can also come as a physical card, please note that the physical card itself has no utility (it canâ€™t be inserted into a pay phone for example) other than to show the customer how to use the service.
how do phonecards work?
step 1: dial the access number. step 2: enter in your pin. step 3: dial the international number of the person you wish to speak to.
what are prepaid phonecards?
a prepaid phonecard is a phone card that you load with credit in advance â€“ itâ€™s not connected to a plan of any sort and can typically be recharged or topped up with more credit.
can i use a prepaid phone card on an old cell phone?
yes, as long as you can call our local access number, your old cell phone will work with our service.
do you need a sim card to use a phone card?
yes. phone cards do not come with their own phone numbers, they are a service that requires that you are already connected to a network through a sim card.
do phone cards still exist?
even with new technology like the internet, phone cards still offer benefits. phone cards use the same copper wires as landlines, allowing calls to places with poor or no internet connectivity. older generations often prefer the familiarity of a telephone over apps and video chatting. additionally, phone cards provide very inexpensive rates for international calls, much cheaper than plans from major phone companies. so phone cards remain useful for their ability to access remote areas, appeal to those who favour landlines, and save money connecting people across borders.
