who we are



founded and run by women who have experienced birth trauma, we are the only charity in the uk solely dedicated to supporting women and families who have experienced traumatic birth. part mental health charity, part campaigning charity, we work to support parents and families, and improve parents’ experience of birth - engaging and educating health professionals, and taking part in research to identify failings in maternal care. we believe we were the first charity in the world to support those with birth trauma, and this year - 2024 - sees us celebrate our 20th birthday.we were honoured to be chosen as the lead organisation advising on the 2024 parliamentary inquiry into birth trauma, initiated by theo clarke mp and rosie duffield mp. you can read the final inquiry report here. podcasttheo clarke has a new podcast on birth trauma called breaking the taboo. in the first episode she discusses what birth trauma is and the effect it has with the bta’s kim thomas and campaigning mum gill castle. you can download it from apple or spotify. awareness weekevery year we run birth trauma awareness week, which is always on a specific theme and includes a mix of social media activities, including blogposts, q&as and video interviews. in 2025, the week will run from 14 july to 20 july. we will announce theme nearer the time. in 2024, awareness week was on the theme of informed consent. we published a report, ‘it’s easier to catch them unawares’: informed consent in labour and birth, outlining the results of a survey we carried out. trusted legal partnersmany parents who come to us for help need legal advice, whether that’s to do with making a complaint against the trust where they gave birth or making a decision about whether to take action for medical negligence. it’s not always easy to know where to turn, so we have set up a panel of legal partners who we trust to offer a compassionate, high-quality service. 




4-5%of women who give birth develop ptsd – approximately 30,000 a year.
