about livvymy heart belongs to the sea. ever since i can remember, i have felt most at home when i was by the coast. from my first holiday abroad at age 11, i remember arriving at lanzarote airport in the blistering heat and asking my parents if we could go and see the beach first, even before unpacking.
nothing quite beats the feeling of the warm sun on my skin, smelling the distinct saltiness in the air and waves lapping at my feet. i feel my happiest and most peaceful when by the ocean. for this reason, i wanted to create a guide for beach lovers alike. although not a fan of flying or airports, i aim to fly to a new destination frequently in search of the best beach holidays.
along the way, i’m also discovering new cities, foods, cultures, and traditions and meeting people who have careers on the beach. my adventurous lifestyle is a book of adventures, and i intend to discover many more as i travel. come along too!
