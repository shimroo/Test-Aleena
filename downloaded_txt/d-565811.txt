                          buzzwords mean a lot to marketing, but only the experience matters to
                          customers. hype from nft, blockchain, ai, vr or any other buzzword
                          are not silver bullets.

                              developers are ground troops, engineers are officers, architects are generals.
                              if you know skill x experience = rank, you will understand. fake titles to entice
                              candidates set up teams to fail.
                            


                              contractors don't buy tools to build
                              your house from social media, so you should not choose your
                              technology on buzzwords or hype.
                            






















my principles







                                        do no harm
                                        





 building
                                      something that is aimed at users and not
                                      about trying to impress with needless
                                      features is important to me.
                                    






                                        leave nobody behind
                                        





 too often
                                      those that need a little extra help should
                                      be accomodated. the web is difficult to
                                      use of you require a screen reader or
                                      assistive technology.
                                    






                                        building with smart tools
                                        






                                      technology is a tool, not a reason. i
                                      choose stacks based on what gets it
                                      done cleanly and maintainable.
                                      complexity pretending to be powerful is
                                      the enemy of all things holy, maintainable
                                      and affordable.
