 the gulf coast bigfoot



            research organization  is leading the
search in the quest for answers
        to the greatest mystery of all,  bigfoot!
our quest initially began in
        the southern united states, which had been either
ignored or completely
        overlooked by most bigfoot researchers for years.
until the gcbro
        came along most emphasis was put solely on the pacific
        northwestern
bigfoot, leaving the southern
        bigfoot to do as they wish, and go virtually undetected for
        years.
yes, there have been reports of
        the southern bigfoot emerge from some research groups,
but not much effort has been
        put into the belief or investigation of these sightings.
we changed all of that and are
        now investigating areas of high activity levels, and have
made some startling discoveries
        pertaining to the habits of these creatures.
we are grateful for all 
        the input we have received thus far from other southern bigfoot
researchers.  their
        observations, and input has helped us in finding new
evidences of these creatures
        existence, and shed new light on old theories.
gcbro  proud to be from & born in the usa
let us continue to function as
        a whole, and not fall prey to the negativity that abounds
in this field of research.
 

 
 bigfoot,
sasquatch,




          or any of the other names for which it is known, is
no
          stranger to the south.  for years we have all heard
          stories and tales from
family
          and friends alike, such as "the wild man, ape man, monkey man,
swamp
          monster", etc., that had been seen back on somebody's
          property, etc., or
how "ol'
          jim ran into that wild man down on the river the other
          night."  these tales
are
          plentiful here in the south. most of the stories and
          encounters go unreported.
there
          seems to be a tendency to just accept these creatures
as
          something that is there, and left at that.
 

 
the most
          famous of the southern bigfoot creatures is the "fouke
          monster",
aka
          "boggy creek monster".  this creature has been reported
          around
fouke,
          arkansas.  a small town in the southwest corner of
          arkansas, just a short
distance
          from louisiana and texas state lines.  it is best known
          from the movie
created
          around it's existence, "the legend of boggy creek".
another
          famous southern bigfoot is "the honey island swamp monster"
which has
          been reported to have been seen in the southeast swamp
areas of
          louisiana.   near the town of covington louisiana,
          just above new orleans.
these
          bigfoot, creature stories made their way into the public eye,
          but there
are
          countless others that do not.  hopefully this site will
          change some of that.
