bad choices to end 2008





new year's eve was exciting. of course i got picked to make the liquor run for the party i was at. and there i was standing in a long line with other drunks, when the video poker machines caught my eye. have you ever had to go back to a party with 1 bottle of whiskey instead of the 5 bottles of other types of alcohol you were supposed to get? well, i did just that. i don't recommend it. at all.
