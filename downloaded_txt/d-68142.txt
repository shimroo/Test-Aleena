laymans school of training - calling america to pray 2004-8































































your church will grow by correctly training and mobilizing the 'sleeping giant' of the laity
















è


















1. devoted intercessors - praying in the harvest2. trained evangelists - gathering the harvest3. caring shepherds - discipling the harvest
















































































the above leaders must have (a) impeccable biblical people skills and (b) excellent management by measurement training.(c) the above ministries need to function within an interrelated motivational structure to maximize member involvement.noah built the ark - but god filled it.  noah's ark is a 'type of our salvation'.  the physical ark represents structure.churches with good structure, offering position & training for leaders of 1,000's, 100's, 50's & 10's will flourish.jesus said, 'i will build my church' when structured after my pattern of prayer, evangelism & shepherding.every church has potential for great leaders - after 24 years of diligent research and application, we found the "laymans" method to be the most effective means to discover, train & activate them.the harvest fields are ready, but do we have the best structure and training for ingathering?




































in conversational & classical greek the word "equipping" has two meanings:-(i) the raising up of an army and (ii) every bone finding its right place.'laymans' will raise up such an army of correctly placed church members.




























































rev. smiley has 24 years of fruitfulness in this proven ministry that is resurrecting "armies of believers" in local churches.

é god's commission for pastors to diligently raise well trained active laymen êezek 37:7b,10 (nas) ...as i prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.10b  ...& the breath came into them, & they came to life, & stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.luke 6:40 (nas) "a pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been fully trained (not taught), will be like his teacher."eph 4:11-12 christ's charge to the 5-fold ministers is to ...equip the saints for the work of ministry...eph 6:15 (nas) ...having shod your (members) feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace...  (sadly most christians have this most vital part of god's armor missing.  a barefoot army is laughable - certainly not one an enemy would take seriously).john 21:16 (nas) jesus said, "...do you (really) love me? ...(then teach my saints to) shepherd my sheep."eph 4:11-12 is the new testament parallel of ezek 37:7-10, which reveals god's purpose for the end time church; which is for every bone in the body of christ to be resurrected to function in its right place - resulting in an exceedingly great army of equipped and mobilized saints actively involved in the spiritual work of the ministry.é curriculum êthe "laymans school of training" is set out like an 18 hole golf course (adding functionality)...
























each hole represents a purposeful, life changing, practical bible course - producing mature, functioning members.  pastor, imagine how awesome it would be having a church of equipped and mobilized "fully trained" members, who under your direction are diligently doing the bulk of the work of the ministry - gathering and discipling the harvest - freeing more of your time to "...devote yourself to prayer, and to the ministry of the word" - acts 6:4.  it's god's divine strategy, as given to moses in exod 18:17-24.i offer my services and years of expertise to help implement god's divine master plan.
