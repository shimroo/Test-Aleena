slinkies
 
my slinky passion started in
1994.  i used to have a
smaller-than-normal slinky in my car that i purchased at pic-n-save (now known
as biglots).  on one of our first dates,
lisa played with it and permanently tweaked it.  i gave her a guilt trip about destroying my slinky.  she tried to find an identical slinky
to the one she tweaked, but the shape proved difficult to find.  this launched a mission to find “odd”
shaped slinkies, an obsession that has branched out to other slinky
paraphernalia.  we now have
hundreds of other slinky items, and we have finally inventoried our
collection.  photos of the collection:
broad overview; closer overview of plastic and
metal slinkies; rainbow slinkies; novelty slinkies; metal slinkies; plastic slinkies; closer overview of plush and
pull-toys; slinky pets; slinky dogs; older slinky novelties;
keychains; unusual miscellaneous pieces.  at epinions, i’ve written reviews on slinkies generally,
the slinky extreme, the
super slinky, and why slinkies are good gifts for executives.  
 
most people who know me believe
that i am the world’s biggest slinky fanatic.  however, i’ve found a milwaukee-area collector who may very well top me!  
 
see the original slinky patent.
