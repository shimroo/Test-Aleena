	life from the trenches....literally
	
  
a perspective on life, sometimes humorous, sometimes critical, yet always thoughtful. a view from the "bottom", rather than the one from the "top" that everyone so clamors for. a realistic view for those not too timid to peak.

	 what's in a profile?
	 
    


so what exactly is in a profile anyway? likes, dislikes, favorite coffee, brand of beer? hmmm, a little of all and more i suppose, but it is very much more fluid than it suggests. take mine for example, the one over there on the side there with the cute little dog, true as it was at the time, it is drastically different now. for starters, the little dog is now gone, no not dead, just lives with mom, who doesn't live with me anymore...see, there's another change! yep, gone is the son, the little trailer in florida, the "palace". things never seem to stay the same in life, but that's not necessarily a bad thing i suppose. a wise man once said "the only constant in this world is change".

so that brings me around to this post, and why i'm starting up again at all. change, i seem to thrive on it much more than some. i'm in galveston, texas now, that's a change back to the seaside for me and that's a good thing. my son is in college, going to be a chef like his dad, that's a change that somehow seems eerily similar to my own path, and it is a good one as well, hell now can cook his own food and eat himself out of house and home, lol! i can deal with that for sure. the wife? well she got tired of staying home sick, so she got well and moved on, and well, that's not a bad thing for either one of us i suppose. i've been cooking up a storm professionally as of late, both in the kitchen and in the press, actually got a full page article printed a few months back that is kinda flattering if do say so myself. at the moment, i am gainfully unemployed again, and as much as i miss the check, i do not miss the stress of running one of the largest kitchens on the gulf coast!

my views? well, they change all the time, i actually voted for obama this time around, but mostly because of the lack of alternatives! i am, and always will remain an individual, neither left on all, nor right as well. the one thing that hasn't changed is my sense of responsibility to my own mind. (was that code for "i'm a self centered bastard?", hmmm...i digress..) anyway, i've time on my hands again and a good read on life today, so here i am again to put my nose where it does and doesn't belong, hopefully with a wit you will enjoy. that's all for now i guess, other than to say, i really don't miss my wife, but damn i miss that dog.

	 henny penny was right!!! (or was he left?)
	 
    


caroline, israel, bush, hamas and blagoya-whateverthe_f, now this is a newscycle!! to coin a phrase, "you know?". actually ms. kennedy, no i don't know, otherwise why would i be listening to your skilled oratories? i can see this crew driving us over the edge on january 19, in comes saint obama...a day late and a scheckel short. i have been wondering why i post on reviewpoint more than here lately, maybe its because when i cue up a really bad new cd, i know what it is i am listening too?! cnn says "all out war", as if they get to decide? nice story on the "aid" boat bound for gaza...(hmmm, looks like a war zone, walks like a war zone, sounds like a war zone....must be a duck?)  puhlease!why is it we have this desire to validate the eagles' dirty laundry, over and over, " she can tell 'bout the plane crash, with a gleam in her eye". i can only imagine what the west texas wonder is thinking now, 'hey daddy! watch this! (oops, was that iran?..hmmm...missed, oh well) so this guy blagoyapuke does the deed, announces a black to replace a black, congress says "foul play" because he refused to take his toys and go home, meanwhile another oppressed hero is born and we don't even know who he is before the cannons of sainthood are adorned, brilliant move for a polish guy in the land of micks, ( i can say that, i am a real life mick myself, so get off my ass about being correct!!..lol)in walks little miss sonshine from new york, wait i thought these guys were from maine, well actually daddy warbucks made his "liquid assets" out of canada, but i digress. the only real problem i have with caroline kennedy actually, is that after years of artful dodging...why the f now? as if this is the golden age of media, seriously? "excuse me gentlemen and ladies, but i really want to play in the big sandbox, you promise you won't watch?" now there's a stellar performance in judgment. listen folks, camelot burned a long time ago, and there is no pulling of a sword in the foreseeable future, unless you count the sword in the suicide king's hand as little george plunges it in deep just before the 20th..."the end is near" can someone please speed things along? (no, israel, not you...oi vay!, kids!!)labels: attorney general roland burris, barrack obama, blagojevich, bush 41, bush 43, caroline kennedy, end times

	 will hillary & jim jones open the "gates" of hell?
	 
    


"there's a lot of people in washington that feel relieved. these are known quantities, they've been around for a while," said cnn senior political analyst bill schneider on cnn's "late edition sunday." "and there's criticism. some on the left say, 'wait a minute -- we voted for change.'"is it risky business coming to 1600 pa. ave soon? mr. obama set a major foundation of his candidacy on getting out of iraq on a fast track, and timely basis, so what's up with this triumverate of past hawks waltzing in on the upcoming ignauguration balls? i mean, granted, hill' knows balls, but seriously, is this such a good sign to be sending out this early in the game yet pending? i watched as gates was floated out to retain his post, i thought to myself, " ok, continuity helps ...", and when ms. clinton softly landed as the impending secretary of state, i mused "hmmm , well she does know a thing or two about the world, and uncle bill does retain a few key connections out there ...". now we seem to complete this "trifecta" with maj. general jim jones, an outstanding vet, to be sure, but lest we forget his ties to mccain?"general jim jones effectively killed the possibility of an obama/jones ticket by appearing with john mccain at an energy related event during the recent presidential campaign."it seems to me, that we are dancing perilously close to the edge of the famous "cliff of lemmings" here, with obama as a seeming pied piper in the lead!don't get me wrong, i like the man, i voted for the ticket, my first democratic cast in my narrow 48 years, but i did so with a few memories of someone saying this war will end soon."immediately begin withdrawing our troops engaged in combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year"i'm not geting that warm and fuzzy feeling anymore...an awful lot remains to be seen in the coming weeks, of course, but i am for one, aman who shall be watching very, very closely.labels: barrack obama, foreign policy, general jim jones, hillary clinton, iraq war policy, marines, robert gates

	 ho, ho , ho! happy rehab america!!!
	 



ok, so here i sit, unemployed now, car re-possessed, bank account closed, and fresh out of rehab. how is the world treating you these days? just peachy here (that's one step short of ducky').secretary henry paulson...(any kin to pat paulson,i wonder?...i digress..)...he says i am doing just fine. hmm...does it sound like i am on the bubble of success? i think more about where i am going to post a resume today than where my next meal comes from, thanks to a cosig grant that supplies me an ample $25.00 per week for attending 4 intensive outpatient treatments a week, i even have a signed letter from the psychiatrist that says i am permanently disabled. oh joy! maybe i can cash in on the extravagant sum of $627.00 per month like my ex-wife? happy days indeed!yes indeed, all my republican errors are now coming back to haunt me, not unlike the ghosts of christmas' past! i know, bush 41 can play "christmas past", a joyful chap full of vim and vigor in repositioning us as the world's reigning goose egg. spreading cheerful excess amongst lobbyist extraordinaire in generous christmas fashion.bush 43, of course, is "christmas present", cameoed as a quaint little elf finishing father time's work. spreading 41's prolific ideas of tax wealth and criminal shame...i wonder where he did his rehab?... teasing the country with tasty little morsels of "tax relief", while gouging the coffers in the name of "trickle down economics". trickle down, isn't that a description of the obvious result of a tot's impression after pissing his/her pants? that brings us to "christmas present", surveys show "deep discounts", "falling prices", and let's not forget "soaring bail-outs for the omnipotent elite corporations across america and the world at large. merry fucking christmas.dear santa; please send me a rope sometime, no, not to hang myself, although the idea has occurred, let me have a rope to tie all those selfish, altruistic, omnipotent a-holes in washington together, and a plane as well to deliver them to n. korea in a humanitarian aid drop. it might destroy a part of the axis of evil, but it might just lend a credible hint of hope for president-elect obama's chance to lead us to some sort of recovery, kind of like "rehab for the us", strip us of the bad, and put us on an ample budget of $25.00 per week, just like me...congress roasting on an open fire,...labels: a.a., bailout, bush 41, bush 43, christmas, congress, economics, henry paulson, obama, rehab, trickle down

	 texas satire
	 
    


ok, so at times i'm kinda like the red headed stepchild of liberals. i have taken all the online tests, and they swear i am a liberal. i consider myself an independent, and a centrist, but the tests never lie, right? so here i am on this liberal blog, talking liberal points after voting most of my life as a conservative, and i look around to see what? the liberals are coming!!!!remember that freaky semi-rock song about the men in white coats coming, "they're coming to take me away, ha ha, ho ho..!",seems like it was early '70s, anyway i think they are the liberals! i have been checking the blogosphere, and there seems to be this movement out there, sweeping the nation with bleeding hearts and carbon monoxide meters, hell, they have even been reported to accost confused individuals acquiring coffee in the morning while driving h3s in california! the very nerve of such tarts!!problem is, though, these sneaky little insurgents are disguising themselves as men and women from all walks of life, even as little teenage girls! i am utterly appalled at the brash tactics employed by these thugs to infiltrate the very fabric of our society! how dare they?! is it not enough that we have to send our young to die in oil laden sands? now we have to acknowledge it? as if to say these atrocities are our faults?puhlease! everyone knows that they bombed us first! remember the alamo! remember goliad?! (ahem..oops, wrong war, sorry..) well, i think i remember hearing cnn declare them as rogue states or the axles of evil knievel anyway. (what a waste of a perfectly good canyon!) and who the hell is this obvious immigrant guy moulitsas? he sounds a bit too greek for me if you know what i mean! (wink, wink) and we all know what position the greeks prefer! and when the hell did my home state of texas become so all fallutin' republican? the last time i checked, texas was full of little guys in little towns, living little lives, hell just listen to the country hit "little bitty", and it’ll tell ya! i'm pretty sure the liberals had something to do with this as well...(stroking my absent beard furtively, and wondering where the hell i was going with the texas thing...oh yeah!)if my grand daddy knew that his beloved brethren had gotten all carpet bagged up and sidled up to a bunch of damn yankees who claim texas lineage, as if to imply texas heritage was unimportant in that lie! how the hell did natalie maines get ostracized for disclaiming bush as a texan anyway? he ain't, and that's that! i am damn sick and tired of texas taking the blame! so here is a born again liberal's view upon modern history.kennedy was killed by a louisianan drifter hired by someone with three initials that don't mean texas. lbj is a freeway in dallas. nixon only dreamed of having texas roots. ann richards was, and is the first lady. the whole damned bush clan started, and as far as i can see will end, well north of the beltway, and have absolutely no claim to the alamo, goliad, border patrol, the texas rangers, dallas cowboys, or anything south of okla-fucking-homa.technorati tags:liberals, texas, lbj, bush, politicsadd to: | technorati |  digg |  del.icio.us |  yahoo |  blinklist |  spurl |  reddit |   furl |

	 to god or not to god; a liberal interpretation
	 
    


so doc collins beat me to the punch with his quote, mine would only be slightly different..."i am a scientist and a believer, and i find no conflict between those world views."mine would read "i am a liberal and a believer, and i find an acceptable conflict between those worlds."it is no secret that i have a belief in christianity, nor is any secret that i have sinned many times, i voted for george as governor and president, jeb for governor, and yes even for poor george the 1st as president way back when, but hey, god forgives...can you?i found it fascinating to listen to francis collins, mapper of the human genome as he talked about his faith and his work."as the director of the human genome project, i have led a consortium of scientists to read out the 3.1 billion letters of the human genome, our own dna instruction book. as a believer, i see dna, the information molecule of all living things, as god's language, and the elegance and complexity of our own bodies and the rest of nature as a reflection of god's plan."dr. collins went on to juxtaposition his theolgical views with his "logical" views in a way that is rarely seen by men of great scientific wisdom, let alone we lowly liberalites. make no mistake, i am not here to make converts or save souls, rather i am speaking about expanding one's inner liberal mind, if you will, to accept that "organized religion" and a "religious belief" have very, very little to do with each other.make no bones about it, the single worst blow for islaam was osama bin laden, and the single worst blow for christianity has been george w. bush.george the extreme. george the drug addict. george the alcoholic. george the party man frat boy. george the arrogant. george the fool. and on the 40th year he arose from the blind and was born again. and he ascended unto the right hand of dad, and did happily send young men to their deaths in foriegn heathenistic lands, and dad saw and it was good.a particularly interesting view from collins' statement was"actually, i find no conflict here, and neither apparently do the 40 percent of working scientists who claim to be believers. yes, evolution by descent from a common ancestor is clearly true. if there was any lingering doubt about the evidence from the fossil record, the study of dna provides the strongest possible proof of our relatedness to all other living things.but why couldn't this be god's plan for creation? true, this is incompatible with an ultra-literal interpretation of genesis, but long before darwin, there were many thoughtful interpreters like st. augustine, who found it impossible to be exactly sure what the meaning of that amazing creation story was supposed to be. so attaching oneself to such literal interpretations in the face of compelling scientific evidence pointing to the ancient age of earth and the relatedness of living things by evolution seems neither wise nor necessary for the believer."now i know that am block quoting an awful lot here, but i feel it is the only way that a few of my more staunch atheist amigos here will actually get to read this statement from a brilliant, "should be atheist", scientist. it is an excellent use of 2 minutes, so go ahead, indulge and read..but buyer be warned, there are truths ahead that may test the dogma of your atheism. i will close with a quote from g.k. chesterstom, the british author who famously remarked "atheism is the most daring of all dogmas, for it is the assertion of a universal negative."labels: collins, genome, god, god and science, liberal, life, science

about me

name:  p_jordan_sr 
location:  galveston, texas, united states 
i love the sea, absolutely adore it. we lived on two fine vessels at a marina here in florida, until charlie visited that is. what a wonderful life that was, rocked to sleep by the tides, fresh air, no land ties to worry about. and then. 
valerie's copd diagnoses, charlie's devastating blow, an un identified nerve disease with shades of ms and als, and homelesness all in a three week period. entrenched.
but that was then, and this is now.
fema planted us in a fine little trailer park in sw florida, and a year later we were living the american dream! homeowners! a beautiful 32 foot rv with a built on "florida room" to boot! hot dog, we had moved up from homeless to the lofty perch of "poor white trash" in a mere matter of months...bought and paid for, this little gem is ours!
valerie is my wife of 16 years, and paul jr. is 14. we, along with alex, our alexandrine parrot, cc, our kittycat that survives charlie with us, and cali, a little dapple red mini dachshund. we call this palace home!
