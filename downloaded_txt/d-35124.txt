as a transgender 
		or 
		gender variant person...

			 
...you already know how 
				important it is for your physical body
				to pass in public as your authentic gender, but...






...have you 
				ever considered how important it is to
				
				transition your mind
				- along
				
with your body?




think about that for a 
				moment... 






what 
				typically happens to so many 


				transgender people 
				who don't improve 
				their mental and emotional selves - while transitioning their 
				physical selves?


 





> many 
							tend to 
							develop new insecurities that they may never 
							have experienced; 

> many 
							discover that some things just don't work as 
							easily for them as they used to;

> many 
							m-to-f trans persons get frustrated when they 
							experience a sudden loss of power; 

> many 
							get angry when they're no longer respected by 
							society as they had been; 

> many 
							don't know how to handle the feelings of rejection 
							they experience from others; 

> too 
							many 
							don't know how to handle the new negative thoughts 
							and emotions they're having;

> many 
							will lash out with intense temper tantrums, and 
							resentment toward others;

> many 
							start hating themselves and others, and typically 
							will speak negatively; 

> some 
							will blame others for all of their problems;

> some 
							will hurt themselves as a means of suppressing their 
							pain; 

> many 
							will turn to drugs and/or alcohol to tranquilize 
							their pain and mental anguish; 

> most 
							become frustrated that their body is not "changing" as 
							quickly as they would like;

> many 
							more nasty self doubts will start creeping into 
							their minds;




> all 
							of that negative thought programming tends to hold most 
							trans persons back;

> many 
							will begin to feel fearful of being read (and 
							embarrassed) by others;

> some 
							will develop a fear of coming out; 

> many 
							become upset about losing friends and family; 

> many 
							have concerns about losing employment, or their 
							home (or both); 

> many 
							tend to become easier targets for bullies; 

> most 
							feel worried about being harassed or attacked; 

> some 
							have fears and other concerns about getting 
							surgery; 

> many 
							often become quite miserable, and

> never 
							mind the fact that more than 40% of all trans people 
							attempt suicide!





wow...doesn't 
				that make transitioning your physical self, without
				
				improving your mental and emotional selves, sound
				scary??





now tell me, how many of these
				scary issues 
				and insecurities 
				have you personally experienced? 


 



                            
							

							have you ever felt:



							> a sudden lack of 
							confidence - just when you need it most?



> 
							worried that your voice or mannerisms will 'give you 
							away'?


> 
							worried about disappointing your partner, family, or 
							others?

> 
							worried about making mistakes 
							while you're out in public?


> 
							pressured to speak and act perfectly in public?


> 
							feelings of inadequacy, or that you're not good 
							enough?


> 
							difficulty focusing at work, school, or during other 
							activities?





                                
							

							do you ever:



							> 
have self 
							doubts, anxieties, or fears tripping you up?



> 
							feel worried about being harassed, attacked, or 
							worse by others?

> 
							get worried about losing your job or career if you 
							come out?

> 
							struggle with the stress and anxiety of coming out 
							to the world?

> 
							feel worried about embarrassing yourself, or other 
							people you're with?


> 
							suffer from a lack of mental & emotional discipline?


> 
							contend with those nasty panic & anxiety attacks?


> 
							deal with recurring mental flashbacks from any 
							negative experiences?



> 
							feel worried about having surgery or other 
							treatments done?



                    



							has this ever happened to you:



							> think negative 
							thoughts...at the worst moments?

> 
							feel too nervous or jittery while you're out in 
							public settings?


> 
							feeling the fear of being ridiculed by others?



                            
							

							how often do you:



							> feel apprehensive 
							about using the restroom that fits your gender?



> 
							feel the fear of getting 'read' while you're out in 
							public?


> 
							feel overwhelming stress & pressures holding you 
							back in life?

> 
							struggle with intense anxiousness about upcoming 
							events?


> 
							get painful memories holding you back from achieving 
							your dreams?



> 
							get depressed, or possibly even have suicidal 
							thoughts?




if you've ever experienced any of these negative 
				issues and insecurities, 
then you 
				already know how much stress and anxiety they can cause you,
				

and

how quickly they can mess up your life!




    


but wait...what 
				if there was a
				better 
				way? 
  






>
what if all of those 
						stressful issues had virtually
						no 
						effect on you?


>
what if your nervousness, 
						self doubts and fears were simply
						no 
						longer there?


>
what if you
						
						never again had any of those obstacles holding 
						you back?


>
what if there was
						an 
						easy way to weaken each of those troubling issues 
						to the
						    point, where they would no longer be noticeable 
						issues in your life?




 


how much 
				better would your overall life become if


you never 
				again had any of those negative obstacles holding you back?








take a moment and imagine 
				what it would feel like for you to be 
				completely 


calm and 
				confident at all times...


how much of a 
				difference would that make on your life?



  
				would it make...a slight difference?



or...

possibly...a big difference?


or...


more like...a huge difference?



or...


would that 
				become...


a major game 
				changer??

well then, today you will 
				begin to 
 
				
neutralize the debilitating 
				effects from all of those negative issues!
