history

								cagny began with a small group of firms and individuals who came together in 1984 to pursue shared interests unique to large-scale, high-quality, primarily residential builders. as construction in nyc and state has evolved, so have our members. as a result of our founders’ vision, and the vision of cagny’s leaders today, cagny initiated several objectives critical to the success of large-scale development projects in new york city. some of these objectives include collective bargaining and insurance reforms, development of safety, security and ethics standards, support of new construction technology, recruitment of women and minority-owned contractors, and legislative advocacy on issues relating to construction.

scholarship
john a. cavanagh scholarship fund


in 2001, cagny created a college scholarship fund to enhance educational opportunities for tomorrow’s construction industry leaders. the fund was named the john a. cavanagh scholarship fund in honor of john a. cavanagh, a founding member of cagny, its past chairman for over 20 years, and a chairman emeritus. sadly, john passed away in 2012; a great loss for cagny and the new york city construction industry at large.


each year, the scholarship fund presents a 4-year scholarship award to an eligible child from each cagny member company, as well as two 4-year awards to economically disadvantaged students enrolled in new york city high schools.
