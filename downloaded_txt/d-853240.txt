welcome to the traffic cone preservation society.
Â 
until the late 20th century, traffic cones were not thought worthy of scientific study. it is the society's mission to counteract these centuries of neglect. by preserving and studying these "helpers of humanity," we hope to allow future generations the opportunity to enjoy these magnificent creatures in their natural habitats.
