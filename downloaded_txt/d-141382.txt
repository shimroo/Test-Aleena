 “over the last eight years, farida has been a wonderful mother, teacher, chef, referee, nurse, musician, and cheerleader to our four children and the many others she has welcomed into her home. we could not ask for a more amazing provider and are so thankful she is a part of our family.”
“we would like thank you for hugging maxwell each day he is with you while we are away. thank you for loving and protecting our children each day. we appreciate your time, attention, patience, and loving gestures that you have shown to all of our children.”
“we are not surprised that itfdc has thrived for thirty years when we consider that it takes a truly great organization to recruit such talented and caring daycare providers as osai.”
“we put our trust and confidence in you to take care of our 3 month old baby, allison. now almost 8 years old, allison still is a part of your life coming to you after school.”
“i will say that the best part about raheela is that she gets him to eat his vegetables!!!”
“with your guidance my little baby has grown into a little gentleman who is polite, kind, smart, and loves to dance.”
“it is always entertaining to receive the daily report and it inevitably involves some funny anecdote about how the kids did something new or learned something new”
“as first time parents, we were very nervous in handing our baby to someone else’s care when he was at such a young age. of all the daycare places that we visited, we were most impressed by your cozy homey place, your warm and loving spirit, and your gentle and caring manner.”
“she and her family offer a perfect home away from home, with so much love. it’s a wonderful environment for our children to laugh, live, love, and learn. as new parents, we also appreciate her wisdom and advice”
“we drop her off every day knowing she is in nurturing hands. emily has learned so much from you. you have been a consistent support for so many of her milestones–eating, crawling, walking, talking, and potty training.”
“you were the first person to make him laugh and we have always felt so lucky that you are in our lives. you taught him so many things and helped him to become the wonderful, caring boy that he is today.”
“we were returning from overseas with our brand new baby and we had so much to do.  finding a daycare was at the top of the list and thankfully we found  salwa who provided a wonderful place for our daughter to grow.  as soon as we met her we were so pleased; her patience, caring and experience with children put our hearts at ease.  she took great care of our daughter and taught her her first words.”
“our boys will become better men because of fifi’s loving influence.”
“under your care our son is blossoming into the most wonderful little boy full of life, adventure, and vibrant personality. we love hearing about his days with you and what new skills and tricks he is learning.”
“the children are always interacting with one another and are encouraged to share and help one another.”
“the thoughtfulness and love you (and your entire family!) have shown them is something we will never forget. you do such a wonderful job of helping the kids feel like your home is their home too.”
“tanya is creative, loving, patient, kind, gentle, and respectful. she is a conscientious professional who not only loves children but recognizes how critical the first years are for teaching the foundational skills necessary for a lifetime of learning and growth.”
“betty can be found reading books with the children or even being a clerk at the pretend grocery store. she is always ready with a fun activity.”
“there is always a new song, new adventure outside, or new book that you introduce to the children and that spirit is evident in his excitement every day.”
“we came to itfdc seeking a different approach for care for our daughter and we not only received what we were looking for but have gained much more – an extended family that the we are grateful and fortunate to have in our lives.”



we are proud to serve essential workers during the covid-19 emergency
some emergency personnel and essential workers are parents too and the pandemic response has made this a particularly challenging time for them. we have been working closely with those whose jobs require them to work during the pandemic. for many they don’t have alternative child care options which is why we need support them in any way we can.
