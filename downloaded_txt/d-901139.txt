healthy churches are essential to making more disciples of jesus christ.


but as churches work to stay relevant in our changing culture, pastors like you often struggle to get the discipleship they need to lead their congregations well. 
it’s easy to feel defeated and isolated when your church is struggling – and the weight is often too much for one person to bear.

testimonials
see how people have been impacted by baptist church planters and our programs!  “this [ leadership journey ] class has helped me learn how to set goals within each of my roles in order to take responsibility for the roles god has given me and to accomplish action steps for the glory of god in those areas. it has helped me to be reminded of the necessity of the spiritual disciplines. i want to learn to be consistent in journaling, memorizing scripture, and fasting, and this class gave me the methods of doing that. i just need to implement these things consistently!” daniel mccoywalnut park baptist church, muscatine, ia “the impact the leadership journey training has had on me is two-fold. first, the training has helped me further my relationship with god by setting my eyes to view the world through his lens instead of through the selfish eyes of a human being. this has led to a biblical view of all my roles in life rather than compartmentalizing some activities as spiritual and some activities as mine to do as i please. this lets the word of god permeate throughout daily life, not just at church. secondly, it has shown me examples and ways that i can help move people along their spiritual walk with god by giving practical steps of spiritual leadership. it has taught me that spiritual leadership is not only given to the pastors in the church, but rather a charge given to members of the church as well.” eric nihartankeny baptist church, ankeny, iowa “going through [teacher journey training] has had a huge impact on my life and spiritual walk. the bible study methods i learned and the accountability that was built into our weekly meetings encouraged my vertical growth while focusing my horizontal discipleship impact. i have continued to utilize the strategies we learned to create meaningful lessons for my sunday school class. as a result of taking tjt, i have grown as a discipler in and out of the classroom. with great excitement, i now lead a bible study group as well.” wendy wynnfaith baptist tabernacle, sherburne, ny “[teacher journey training] has opened my eyes to see god within every passage of the scriptures: who he is in his character and his works. now i see the word as more than “stories,” and i teach with a renewed passion. i have gone from teaching information to discipling my students to know god and to put their confidence in him. i still talk about david and daniel, etc., but now they take their rightful place in the narrative of god.” deacon and part-time teacherpleasant hill baptist church, smithville, oh “we are so grateful for how god is using [intentional discipleship ministries] in our church's ministry. this year, we added teacher journey training to our arsenal of tools to help the people of our church live out what is critical to god. i am so thankful that we added this tool. i have watched our teachers, who are involved, have their eyes opened to the responsibility that they have to help their students live for christ. i have watched our teachers humbly submit to each other to brainstorm, talk and evaluate their methods in order to help make better disciples. i have been able to illustrate these methods from the pulpit and with their help, regularly evaluate the effectiveness. it will be great to see the ripple effect of this tool in the coming years.” pastor brian cederquistgood news baptist church, grand rapids, michigan “at victory baptist church, thirty-five eager children come to joy club on a weekly basis to learn god’s word, and two boys have been saved this school year. at grace baptist church, the youth group has grown from a few to eighteen, and two teens have been saved. in both churches we have believers who love god, love each other, cooperate and work together well, and desire to be used by god.” fran cupplesassociate church planter, victory baptist church in fullerton, ne & grace baptist church in genoa, ne “after years of struggling and seemingly trying to pull my men along, leadership journey has begun to foster an environment of accountability, camaraderie, and spiritual growth that i have never witnessed before. i believe that i am seeing for the first time guys caring for other guys, and each of them trying to spur on one another to good works. it’s been a very beneficial process and one that i’m still very eager to see how the holy spirit continues to move.” pastoriowa
