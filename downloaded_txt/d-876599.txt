level sensors, switches and controls 



abm offers a complete line of plug-and-play, self-adjusting ultrasonic and radar level sensors, level switches, controllers and accessories. select a product to learn more about our solutions. 

















ideal for continuous level measurement applications in challenging environments with vapour, temperature variations, extreme temperatures, extreme dust, wind, foam, ice or acoustic noise.







radar sensors 

















ideal for continuous liquid and solid level measurement in environments without gases / vapours such as co2, co, h2s, h2.







ultrasonic sensors 





















ideal for continuous level measurement in short range liquid applications measuring weirs, small tanks, drums, totes or barrels.







mini ultrasonic sensors 

















ideal for continuous level measurement in liquid applications for underwater pump control / protection and liquid-solid interface detection such as sand or sludge and water.







submersible sensor 





















ideal for point level measurement in liquid applications that benefit from non-invasive operation.







non-invasive switch 

















sensor mounting accessories for ease of installation and sensor aiming.







accessories 





















a complete line of controllers and displays to meet your need with dry contact monitors, relay controllers, and loop powered displays.







controllers

abm offers a complete line of plug-and-play, self-adjusting, ultrasonic and radar level sensors, controllers and accessories. our technologically advanced sensors have feedback with their environment, automatically adjusting their parameters to a wide range of environments without user interference for accurate and reliable level measurement in any application. select a product to learn more about our solutions. 







 



radar should be your choice when dealing with challenging environments such as vapor, temperature variations, extreme temperatures, extreme dust, wind, foam, ice, acoustic noise, etc. 



radar sensors 















ultrasonic is the ideal solution for liquids and solids without gases / vapours such as co2, co, h2s, h2.

 



ultrasonic sensors 















mini ultrasonic sensors are used in liquid applications such as food & beverage processing and small tanks such as barrels due to their mounting and maintenance-free nature.
 



mini ultrasonic sensors 















the cellular gateway connects up to eight rs485 type abm level sensors to the secure abm server using a cellular network for access to the customer web portal and 24/7 online support.
 



cellular gateway 



















based on the vibration patterns, the non-invasive switch is the ideal solution to detect the presence or absence of liquid inside a tank - directly opposite the switch.
 



non-invasive switch 















the submersible ultrasonic sensor is ideal for submersible pump control or detection of solid materials such as sand or sludge in liquids, with self-cleaning of the air bubbles.
 



submersible sensor 















ultrasonic transducers matched to air with very uniform polar-pattern, low ringing and very wide temperature operation -40 to 130°c (-40 to 266°f).
 



ultrasonic transducers 















the relay controllers with up to 6 relays, readouts energized by the 4 ma to 20 ma current loop. easy set-up using push-buttons.
