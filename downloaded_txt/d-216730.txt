home electric systems 
for on or off grid

make your own  home electricity with 
alternative energy wind generators and solar electric modules (also called 
photovoltaic or pv). the pv modules generate electricity when exposed to light, 
have extremely long life, no moving parts and almost no maintenance. installing 
a home energy system is within the grasp of many people. you can start small and 
add on as needed. many homes in the usa and world wide are already using wind 
and solar electricity. they are statements to reducing pollution, waste, 
dependence on fossil fuels and increasing independence and self-reliance.





make your home, cabin, farm, camper or rv better and be more 
self-reliant. there is always a risk of natural disasters and conflicts. be 
prepared with sources of electricity, water, food, fuel, etc. a disruption in 
commerce, no matter the cause, will catch many people dependent on others to 
bail them out. become more prepared so you will be in a position to help others 
and not be a burden to your community.

basic engine generator system
    
    some systems start out with just battery, inverter and 
    engine generator. the inverter quietly powers the house. an engine generator 
    is used periodically to recharge battery or power loads to large for 
    inverter. solar modules or wind generator can be added to help charge 
    battery and reduce engine generator run time. a gasoline, propane or diesel 
    generator can also be used for backup power for on grid house.








 
a home alternate energy system might 
include: 


          air max wind turbine on tilt-up 
tower
         
six 350 watt pv modules on a pole mount
         
power boosting solar charge controller (mppt)
         
lithium batteries or lead acid deep cycle batteries
         
inverter to convert battery power into ac 
electricity

this system could provide 1.3 kilowatt hours per day from wind in a 12 mph 
average wind area. solar could provide another 4-10 kwh/day depending on climate. 
a small system of 1 or 2 pv modules is commonly used for rvs, campers, water 
pumping or as a starter system. an engine powered generator can be used as a 
backup to power large loads and to help charge battery during low wind and solar 
periods. solar or heat pump water heaters are a great way to provide hot water. 
small systems can be 12 volts. 
medium or large systems are 24 or 48 volt. larger diameter wire size is required 
for lower voltage systems. higher voltage systems will save on wire costs.
we encourage people to be more energy 
efficient so their system can be smaller, cost less and reduce their cost of 
living from now on.
