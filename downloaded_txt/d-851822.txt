note: sponsorship price is reflected with current discount. 
in 2025, the oelma conference will be located at oclc in dublin, oh, november 14-15, 2025. the multi-day in-person conference and the centralized location will be a big draw for the conference. the conference planning committee has created a schedule that will let attendees and exhibitors capitalize on this wonderful location and venue. as an exhibitor, you will have more time with attendees, more exposure for your products and services, and a more productive exhibitor experience!
there are many opportunities for you to participate. members of our exhibitor committee are eager to work with you to create a custom sponsorship package that helps you showcase your company and services in the way that fits you best. hundreds of school librarians, educators, and administrators are expected to attend oelma 2025 and your sponsorship will make it possible for oelma to present another great event!
a copy of the digital sponsorship packet is available here.
