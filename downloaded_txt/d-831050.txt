boundary garlic began growing and selling seed garlic in october 2002 and in october 2019 henry and sonia retired from the seed garlic business.
this website is known for the wealth of garlic information. we will keep it going for the foreseeable future.
 we sold certified organic seed garlic  grown on our own property. seed garlic is garlic which has been grown with meticulous attention to quality. 
my husband henry and i - im sonia - began growing garlic on the ranch in 1999. the ranch is in the boundary area in the southern interior of british columbia. in the beginning we started with several heirloom cultivars. these flourished and we built up our collection until at one point we had about 200 distinct cultivars. we gradually worked it back down to a more manageable number, selling off the ones that were not doing well in our environment. by 2019 we were down to about 40 strains and henry has kept some 20 for personal use.
our relationship with garlic  transformed into a conscious, mindful partnership. the more carefully we listened, the better we were able to meet the needs of the different garlics and to collaborate with them in their culture and dissemination.
 
 what we grew
the canadian climate is particularly well suited to growing true hardneck garlic varieties. we had a large selection of cultivars (strains) of garlic from the five true hardneck varieties which thrive in our cold winters and moderately hot summers. we also had softneck garlics and ‘weakly bolting hardnecks’. for information on the changing face of garlic classification see the article by bob anderson on the garlic family tree. 
the varieties pages show some of the  garlics that were available from each of the five hardneck varieties: rocambole, porcelain, purple stripe, marbled purple stripe and glazed purple stripe; from the three weakly bolting hardnecks: asiatic, creole, and turban, and from the softneck varieties artichoke and silverskin. 
bulbils
we grew many of our strains up originally from bulbils and we refreshed our stock from time to time by growing from bulbils. 
growing bulbils is an excellent way to develop your planting stock. it is economical and in the years it takes for bulbs to reach their full potential the garlic strains adapt to your particular growing conditions.
