	 'the blog according to don' has come to an end
	 
    


after a week of pondering i have officially decided to discontinue this blog.with my new myspace site up i felt i needed to make some changes and this is one of them.  their are so many political blogs out their and this i felt just did not get a lot of notice.i am trying a different approach with myspace focusing on life & leisure topics and entertainment.  i might throw in some politics once in awhile but not as much as it was here at tbatd.i plan to leave my blog up for awhile.  afterwards i intend to take it down.check out myspace page.http://www.myspace.com/donmccullenthanks for your support for past two years or so.don mccullen

here is the link.http://www.myspace.com/donmccullenwith this new site on myspace i am really looking into discontinueing this blog. after a few years it seems that this blog has not gotten the attention i hoped for. also i have not said much and done more links to commentaries if anything.it takes time to put my blog up, and its not as easy as it looks. i will let you know what my final desision will be. very likely i will end this blog.be sure to visit my new myspace site soon.

george will talks about the dangers of making dc a state. does show that the dems want to stay in power and suck us dry. they really don't want fairness; they want it unfair. this is what power hungry socialists do.robert novak talks about the new budget that the dems came up with. the biggest tax increase in history, and kent conrad thinks the time is ripe for that to happen. read on.don't worry if this should come to pass the democrats truly do care about the hard working people of this nation. you sweat and they still can live the good life with lots of money to burn. now tell me who thinks your stupid.their were no terroists in iraq until we came in. victor davis hanson says otherwise.william f. buckley talks about john edwards plan for free health care. somebody has to pay for it however.ann coulter says the republicans should stop saying sorry and reminds us that the president can fire political appointees anytime he wants and for no reason.
