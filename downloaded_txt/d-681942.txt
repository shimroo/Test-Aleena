because god is free the future must be open
 


ultimately, open theism is not based on man's freedom but on god's freedom. open theism is the christian doctrine that the future is not settled but open because god is alive, eternally free, and inexhaustibly creative. although this undeniable truth is virtual heresy to many calvinist and arminian theologians, regardless, open theists affirm the obvious, that god is able to think new thoughts. and he can write new songs. and if he so desires he could design new butterflies too.
