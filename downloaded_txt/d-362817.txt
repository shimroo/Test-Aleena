        for over 46 years american has created unique pipes-
      lightweight and comfortable, using only the finest hand selected
      grecian plateaux briar. all american pipes employ a custom made
      italian black lucite stem which is filed, sanded, and polished to
      perfection to ensure a long and comfortable relationship between
      the pipe and its owner. we also offer pipe making kits. customer
      designs are always welcomed as we endeavor to create your "dream"
      pipe.
