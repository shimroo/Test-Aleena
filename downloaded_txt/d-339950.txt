promoting asthma care for children

















































 
 
 


welcome!
allies against asthma (allies) was a national initiative to improve asthma control for children and adolescents. funded by the robert wood johnson foundation with direction and technical assistance provided by the center for managing chronic disease, university of michigan, allies supported seven community-based coalitions and their efforts to improve the way asthma is managed in their communities and provides resources and tools to support other asthma coalitions and programs throughout the united states.  

the allies initiative has closed, but evaluation activities of the impact of the coalitions' work continues at the center for managing chronic disease.  medicaid health care utilization data will be analyzed over the next few years, and findings will be posted on this site as they become available.
