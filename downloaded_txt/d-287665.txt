maiden voyage is a 15.2 hh chestnut mare born 5/9/2017.  she is a homebred kwpn dutch warmblood out of bon voyage by florianus ii.  she is small but mighty.  she has a lot of scope and has the potential to be a very competitive child/adult jumper.  she is honest to the jumps, quick in the air and has a great lead change.  she hacks quiet for those looking for a non-spooky comfortable ride.  never been bred.  not a lot of mileage because we were waiting for her to grow.  wears two front shoes and is up to date on vaccines.  she is registered for life with usef and kwpn.

giulia is a 12 year old 16.3hh registered kwpn mare out of garole by judgement isf.  i have 4 wonderful foals from her and i have decided to stop my breeding program.
i bred her to olympic jack bwp and have a lovely mare named olympic jill (5/19/2019), then i bred her to omano bc and i have positano (5/12/20), roger that (5/3/21) and testimony (3/9/23).
she is currently not in foal.  she is up to date on shots.  we purchased her in 2018 and are unaware of any riding training.  please call for pricing or lease option.  good home a must!
