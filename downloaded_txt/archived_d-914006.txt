hello everyone,
 
congratulations on getting a job.  my name is david kanter, and i am
working at one pennsylvania plaza.  i am looking for an apartment in
brooklyn or some other place that is relatively inexpensive (i am hoping
for under 600 a month per person).  i have taken a look and found some
stuff.  would anyone be interested in rooming me with me?

i don't smoke, drink or party much, although my taste in music is a bit
loud to some people.  let me know if you are interested and best of luck
finding apartments.


regards,


david kanter

subject: [sitc_newyorkcity] ideas for sitc programs?

thanks for subscribing to one of the summer in the cities mailing 
lists!  the staff of caps and the alumni association are currently seeking 
ideas for workshops, events, etc. over the summer specifically in chicago, 
dc, and nyc.  as students planning to be in one of these areas over this 
summer, we'd like to hear from you!

i've set up a "thread" on the sitc discussion board and hope that you may 
take some time to post some ideas of what you think you would like to see, 
attend, participate in, etc.  the process is very easy -- simply go to 
http://caps.uchicago.edu/sitc and "click here" under the section titled 
"summer in the cities discussion board."  you will see a message titled 
"ideas for sitc events?" -- click on it and post a reply!

you may be wondering why we aren't just asking you to respond via email -- 
the answer?  so you can see what your fellow students are saying!  the idea 
is that the discussion will continue throughout the summer and that those 
in charge of summer programming will be able to check the discussion board 
regularly for new ideas.

if you have any questions, feel free to reply directly to 
swang00@uchicago.edu.  otherwise, we hope to see your responses online!

thanks,
sophia

2100 employees and directs projects of a corporation with sales of almost $6.5 
billion annually.  her proven energetic leadership tempered by wisdom and 
experience provides a strong foundation for the company as they enter the 21st 
century. 

pamela was born in new york city and studied at the university of 
massachusetts, amherst and the european business school in london. she has 
lectured at new york university, marymount college and the real estate board of 
new york and serves on numerous panels and committees. a nationally recognized 
market expert, she is frequently quoted as a real estate specialist by such 
leading news organizations as the new york times, the wall street journal, cnn, 
national public radio, and bloomberg. in 2002, crain's named pamela as one of 
the new york business world's rising stars in its annual "40 under 40" 
article.  in 2003, the new york post selected her as one of the 50 most

for any one interested in exploring careers in financial services, we 
sincerely hope you will be able to make it out to tonight's event.  we 
have invited a number of young alumni all working in financial services 
to chat about the industry and job search strategies.

some students in the past have asked about networking tips -- here are 
easy tips to remember:

1) don't clutter with your friends.  if you do, you won't have the 
opportunity to meet new people.  agree that you will separate at the 
beginning of the party and then make an effort to introduce each other 
to those you meet.

2) a great place to introduce yourself is around the food/drinks.  when 
someone is waiting in line with you, simply introduce yourself.  a 
simple "hi, i'm john smith and i'm a third year undergrad" can suffice.

3) speaking of drinks, we highly discourage students from drinking 
alcohol at these events.  you just don't know how people will respond.  
*for tonight's event, please bring your picture id as there might be a bar.*

4) some questions to get a conversation started:

-- where do you work?
-- what do you do?
-- how long have you been at xx company?
-- how long have you been in ?
-- what did you study at the uofc?

5) some questions that you might expect:

-- where do you work?  (if you aren't working, what are you doing that 
is productive? volunteering? taking classes? relaxing?)
-- what do you do there?
-- what are you studying?
-- how do you like being at the uofc?
*
if you are planning to attend tonight's event, please make sure to rsvp 
by emailing jessica ansehl, ab '05 at jansehl@uchicago.edu.  hope you 
will be able to come and have fun!*

hello new york,

my name is koryn kendall. i will be assisting conor barnes 
in coordinating the summer in the cities program the next 
couple of months. i will be the person to contact with 
questions regarding any of the events. e-mail is probably 
the best way to reach me, although if it is urgent you may 
call 773-702-9456 to get a hold of me or conor. 

first, i would like to thank all of you for already joining 
the listhost. we have a number of exciting events planned 
for you. these events are coordinated with the alumni office 
and are open to current college students. we hope that they 
will offer you a relaxing and friendly atmosphere to network 
with other alums and enjoy the summer. 

to start the summer off in new york, i would like to remind 
those of you who have registered that this friday, june 23, 
is the âyoung alumni brooklyn brewery happy hourâ. also, 
this saturday, june 24, there is a ânature walk in central 
parkâ. you must have already registered/rsvped to attend 
these events. to find out the exact time and location of the 
events and for more information about the program in 
general, go to alumnievents.uchicago.edu and click on 
the âevents calendarâ

once again, if you have any questions or concerns feel free 
to e-mail me.

thank you,
koryn kendall
