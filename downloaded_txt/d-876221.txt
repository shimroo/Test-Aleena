    for a swamp tour that is more than just a boat ride




   about cajun country swamp tours owner, walter “butch” guchereau, grew up on a small cajun farm located on the banks of the bayou teche in breaux bridge, la. from early on his father introduced him to the swamps of cajun country. by hunting, sport and commercial fishing and just plain exploring he came to know the swamps like his own backyard. butch put himself through college by working summers on dredge boats located in louisiana on the mississippi and atchafalaya river systems where he experienced the dynamic forces that have built the land of acadiana over the last 25,000 years. he learned how the rivers, bayous, wetland areas, man’s interventions and coastal erosion are all intertwined and constantly changing. the time he has spent in the swamplands of cajun country coupled with college degrees in zoology and botany has given butch a rich insight into the ecology of louisiana swamps.this knowledge has been taught to cajun country swamp tour boat captains to make your tour educational, entertaining, and enjoyable (more than just a boat ride). your swamp tour is taken personally by us because we know that for many of you this maybe your only trip to cajun country and it is important to us that everyone’s swamp tour in cajun country is both pleasurable and memorable. our tour boats are open cajun crawfish skiffs powered by an extremely quiet, environmentally friendly, 4-stroke outboard motor with the water intake fixed so that shallow water muck and thick vegetation are not a problem. this very quiet motor, and the relatively small size of the swamp tour boat allows for some great wildlife viewing.my swamp tour guides and i have spent most of our lives either learning about or earning an income from the swamps of cajun country - this is where we want to be. the swamps are our passion and joie de vivre (joy of life), and sharing a few hours with people who love and enjoy nature and the great outdoors is an enjoyable experience for us. our personal experiences and observations along with my educational background enables us to give you an insightful eco-journey into the swamplands of the atchafalaya basin that is educational, enjoyable and entertaining; and just maybe with a serving of cajun hospitality this will not be your only trip to cajun country.



   located only minutes from lafayette; an hour from baton rouge; 1.5 hours from lake charles; and 2.5 hrs from new orleans, louisiana... in the heart of cajun country!
