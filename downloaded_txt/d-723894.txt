the uk's telephone network is changing







we're upgrading the uk to digital phone lines and will be retiring the analogue phone network by 31st january 2027. this means that landline voice calls will be transmitted in the same way your broadband works.
 
find out what the digital upgrade means for you








































who we are and what we do







let's take a look at who we are, what we do, and what we don't do


























we're network builders







we build and maintain the uk’s largest broadband network. this includes managing the copper phone line network and rolling out cutting-edge full fibre broadband to 25 million homes and businesses across the country by december 2026 - that's one every 10.4 seconds.







discover openreach and what we do


































we supply network services







when it comes to broadband (as well as tv and phone packages), there’s the network that carries the data and then there’s the broadband and tv bundles that you order for your home. we supply network services to more than 650 service providers, for example, sky, vodafone, talktalk, ee, bt, and bt business who use them to bring broadband packages to you.













































we install and repair the network







because we supply the network, we’re in charge of installing and repairing the network, on behalf of the service providers. we’ll build the physical connections that bring broadband into your home, while your service provider will supply the broadband package.





































we’re not a service provider







we don’t supply the packages that allow you to use broadband, watch tv, or make phone calls. if you have an issue with your broadband service, you’ll need to contact your service provider. if there’s a problem with the network – for example physical damage to the cabinet or a telegraph pole – then you should contact us.












































our broadband network in numbers

















26k
field engineers working round the clock to deliver the highest quality service.














70k
homes and businesses our full fibre broadband network reaches each week.














98.3k
poles we replaced, repaired or recovered so our people and the public will always stay safe and connected.
