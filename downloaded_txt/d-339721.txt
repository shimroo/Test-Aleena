my plants are hearty and beautiful, and my son is ecstatic to have less grass to cut!
angela bushman




the craftsmanship and attention to detail is incredible!
bathroom remodel




working with the team at minnehaha falls landscaping has been a joy. i needed a master plan for my yard. i worked with them to let them know what i liked and my goals for a yard that is human, dog and pollinator-friendly. i now have a master plan and we have begun the work in stages. the dog run went in first and my dog loves it!
beth harvey




they installed a butterfly garden along my fence where it was difficult to mow. the new garden immediately began teeming with pollinators of all sorts including monarch butterflies. i absolutely love watching the butterflies and bumble bees dance around the garden while i sit on my back deck. the plants grew enough to fill in the garden in less than one season because of the amazing compost and soil management.
julie




i was thrilled at the results i got from minnehaha falls landscaping. they’re creative, and an impeccably professional landscaping company. they know gardening, and always have a good idea for what to do with my garden. and not only that, but they’re a whiz at creating beautiful patio spaces– their work and creativity allowed my family to enjoy our garden even more. everyone who is looking for someone to help them figure out how to beautify and optimize their outdoor space should talk to minnehaha falls landscaping. you’ll love the result. i certainly did!
keith stacy

scott and arlene kringle




our backyard is now an oasis. our relationship with minnehaha falls landscaping is a partnership, and we couldn’t be happier.
tim kretzmann




thank you minnehaha falls landscaping. our experience could not be any better – the patio is amazing! we sit on the new patio every night and enjoy the landscaping, trees and shrubs. it really feels like a new room in the house.
tom & kelli




minnehaha falls landscaping created a comprehensive landscaping plan for our property, including removal of old overgrown shrubs and planting a variety of shrubs and flowers suited to our shaded property. they also added some rock features and a nice slate garden path and rain garden. these guys are great, i highly recommend them.
tim k




russ and his crew helped us remove our traditional front yard and convert it it a grass-free landscape using native plants. russ took our suggestions about what we wanted and designed the landscape using some of our existing plants, and incorporating additional new natives. the crew was great – punctual, neat, and responsive to our suggestions along the way. we are thrilled with our new front yard space and look forward to watching it grow in the spring and happy to have established a bird and bee friendly space for years to come. we would recommend them to anyone interested in going native.
margaret b




chesney and russ have an incredible landscaping business focused on creating healthy environments for all. their chemical free focus and natural approaches to benefit nature are so appreciated – and needed. thank you for all you do.
susan k




in only two applications, our lawn has never looked better! it’s finally getting the nutrients it needs for optimum growth. it’s not the artificial-looking thick carpet grass that is the result of toxic chemicals. it is simply green with some patches of clover left intentionally for the bees, just like grass should look! the products are pure, organic, and bursting with nutrients for the soil, plants, and probably the whole environment! every aspect of this company is stellar. the employees are respectful, professional, and have great follow-though. we will continue to work with russ and his company, and encourage anyone reading this to call and get on the service schedule. you will be soooo happy you did!
mary beth




the education and encouragement that russ provided during a consultation session alleviated my overwhelm and indecision with planning a pollinator habitat in my yard. russ provided a simple yet thorough plan for each step along with design ideas and recommendations according to my preferences. russ’s insight and recommendations for materials and plants likely saved much frustration and potential over spending on unsuccessful design. highly recommend!
tracy peterson




minnehaha falls landscaping desinged and built a patio, garden and small beach at our home. they cleared the overgrown buffer zone and decided where the patio would be placed. then they designed the landscaping and planted it. the people who worked in the yard were professional, polite and funny. they did a great job with the entire project. we spent many hours relaxing on our new patio surrounded by beautiful flowers. we highly recommend them for your yard projects.
jone tiffany




we approached minnehaha landscaping wanting a patio and a landscape plan. we worked with their landscape designer. our instruction was whatever you come up with make it look like it has always been there. they hit it out of the park! we thoroughly enjoyed working with them.
scott k




minnehaha falls landscaping recently built a lovely 10×12 paver patio in a shady area of our yard. the price was reasonable, and the work was done quickly but with great care and little disruption. we couldn’t be happier.
chris d




russ and his team helped my husband and i turn our passion for preservation into action by transforming our landscape into an everblooming nature refuge. the minnehaha falls landscaping team was professional, respectful, and kind to work with. our pollinator paradise gardens delights us year round – even in the winter! the bee lawn is a low maintenance dream come true. the lack of pesticides has welcomed flora and fauna that we delighted to see in south minneapolis!
leah




that soil! all the plants grow with such incredible enthusiasm! the soil work russ and his team did is amazing. every year our plants come up taller, denser, and faster growing than other gardens i see, especially when it gets dry out. the last 3 summers have been really dry, and our native plants are able to power thru it no problem, with their deeper roots and native adaptations. our yard looks amazing and green all summer longs even when then neighborhood lawns turns brown.
dan




we are returning customers because we love the wall, patio, stoop & pavers path they installed 12 years ago. this year we added to the patio and added a grill pad off the path. they did another beautiful job. they are professionals that care about their customers and the quality of the work. after all the work was done, they cleaned up everything. there was nothing for us to do but enjoy the results. i recommend minnehaha falls landscape highly. they are my go-to company!
lynda k




responsive, knowledgeable and fun to work with – highly recomend!!
nancy z




minnehaha falls landscaping repaired my falling-down retaining wall, which was leaning over the sidewalk after many years of frost heave and wet ground. they listened to my concerns that this section of wall be super-stabilized because of worry over rising groundwater and reused the existing blocks, removing most of the wall to put in a new foundation. the crew was friendly, explained what they were doing and worked hard and long at a heavy and difficult job. the repaired wall is perfectly straight and level. i’ve hired many contractors but minnehaha stood out for their communication, promptness and work quality. recommended!
mary jane




top notch landscaping team. couldn’t be happier!
susan kaulbars




russ and his team were magnificent to work with. we like to think of our home and yard as a work of art. russ was able to guide us with education and suggestions to create a yard that is environmentally friendly and beautiful in our eyes. the team is hardworking, knowledgeable and friendly. the wall reminded me of the egyptian pyramids. each piece laid surgically and beautifully. environmentally friendly piece of art! we couldn’t be more pleased!
