			health			
 




high lead/copper
biofilm
low chlorine
disinfection byproducts
 
by 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas. seaquest makes water safer to drink by preventing harmful contaminants from entering the water from the pipes.













			complaints			
 




red water
black water
low pressure
 
 
in the us alone there are >2.2 million miles of pipes, with an average age of 45 years. most of these pipes suffer from corrosion and scale, which cause color and flow issues for consumers. seaquest stops these issues and complaints are eliminated.













			water flow			
 




excessive flushing
clogged pipes
well productivity
 
 
a water main breaks every two minutes, and an estimated 6 billion gallons of water is lost per day. seaquest reduces pipe corrosion and cleans out scale buildup, which reduces the number of pipes needing to be replaced.













			ops / regulatory			
 




compliance
dangerous chemicals
hard-to-feed chemicals
 
 
it’s estimated by nrdc that >5,000 water systems in the us may be in violation of the epa lead / copper rules. seaquest complies with the upcoming lead / copper rule changes, and most seaquest customers have moved to reduced monitoring.













			cost			
 




expensive chemicals
hard to control chemicals
low bill rates
rogue water loss
 
in 2019, the total us capital spending on water was $48b, while investments needed were $129b (gap of $81b). seaquest users typically experience total chemical cost savings between 5-50%, freeing up money for other system improvements.
