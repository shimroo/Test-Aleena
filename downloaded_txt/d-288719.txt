 making an impact“as a parent and a passionate supporter of the arts, i am continually inspired by washington performing arts. the education program, children of the gospel (cotg) in particular, has helped shape my twin daughters into both skilled artists and ardent arts enthusiasts.
since joining the choir five seasons ago at age eight, i’ve witnessed their personal growth ―from honing their vocal talents to learning the values of teamwork and dedication ―and the experience has been truly transformative for our entire household.”
– dr. tafaya ransom
