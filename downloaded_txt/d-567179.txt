	 straggler!
	 
    


this is a sadly washed-out picture but i had to post and profusely thank everyone who posted on this kal.  i made this sweater in about a month, off and on, in august and september.  it's my first knitted garment!  until this sweater i'd only made scarves and other square things.  i pored voraciously over this knitalong and took copious notes about the shaping and the sizing, and thank god it worked!!!  i didn't have to frog back at all!  the arms are a wee bit bigger around than i'd like, but they're certainly not bad, and the sweater body fits perfectly.really, i can't thank you all enough for all your notes.  i feel like i got to avoid a lot of the problems some of you experienced, thanks to your chronicling of the problems you had!  i added a lot of waist and hip shaping that i wouldn't have considered otherwise.  i've worn it to work several times and it just successfully had its first washing and drying experience.hooray for overdue green gables!

	 my green gable in progress
	 
    


hi everyone,i just joined this blog as i was thinking my gg wasn't turning out right.  however, i'm not so sure now that i put it on waste yarn and put it on.  it does look kind of crooked, but that could just be that i didn't have it on straight.  but it seemed huge on the needles but is fitting when it's on. i made the size 34 and my actual bust size is 34 1/2.  does it look right?here's what it looks like off the needles...

here's where i am after 2 short car trips, 2 bus rides, 1 lunch break, and 2 episodes of the sopranos (the last two of season 4, if you're curious.).not bad.  if i were an optimist, i'd say i think i can get this done by the end of this weekend, but...i'm not.  hehe...
