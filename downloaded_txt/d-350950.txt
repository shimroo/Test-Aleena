on 
		our lifeâs journeys there are major turning points. falling and 
		fracturing her hip, and then having surgery was an experience that 
		forced barbara sinor to travel an unknown path. the experience took 
		barbara beyond her normal life to exploring emotions and thoughts in 
		foreign regions. while barbara was confined to a rehabilitation facility 
		to recover, her inner journey took her through territories of fear, 
		doubt, pain, guilt, and down other emotional paths. regardless of your 
		personal struggle, the lessons in inspirational musings: insights 
		through healing offers courage and insights to awaken and 
		transform.

		newest book!

inspirational musings
insights through healing



advanced reviews:
inspirational musings is a 
		beautiful, compassionate companion book, a precious gem to be used as a 
		lifeline on those gloomy days when one needs a boost. this work offers 
		poignant musings for those going through any kind of emotional and 
		physical trauma, offering insight and strength. inspirational 
		musings is a soft and poignant reminder that we must grieve at our 
		own rate, slow down, practice mindfulness and compassion, enjoy nature, 
		and allow life to unfold. 
		sinorâs wisdom and kindness illuminate every page. she reminds us that 
		while suffering is a part of lifeâs journey, love and compassion are our 
		higher powers. the book is a heartwarmer, and a reminder that healing, 
		no matter what kind, is a form of awakening. this book is a blessing to 
		whoever picks it up and one that deserves to be read over and over again.
		diana raab, mfa, ph.d., author
writing for bliss and writers on the edge
we all 
		have times when physical challenges pin us to the spot. sometimes we 
		squirm, sometimes we relax, and sometimes--if we are very fortunate--we 
		use the time as barbara sinor has, jotting down contemplative thoughts 
		stirred by the stillnedd. drawing on words from many teachers and adding 
		her own honest stories and reflection during a time of convalescence, 
		barbara offers us a small book to dip into when we want to go deeper, 
		when we need to find healing for this moment. 
		inspirational musings: insights for those in recovery is a 
		book to slip into your pocket or bag as your travel the journey that is 
		taken by human beings.

exquisite! how so like 
		barbara sinor to use her time in rehab to delve inside herself to 
		explore and expand her soul journey as her body heals, and then to share 
		the treasure she unearths with the world. inspirational musings 
		is to be savored page by page, insight by insight, bit of wisdom by bit 
		of wisdom. enjoy!
anita rosenfield, ph.d., author of 
		flame: a cautionary tale
 
recovery from emotional, 
		physical, or spirational trauma can overwhelm even the strongest among 
		us; yet it can be an unprecedented opportunity for our personal growth.
		inspirational musings is a treasure trove of elegant, gentle, 
		and wise passages written by dr. barbara sinor while undergoing her own 
		rehabilitation. poetic, profound, and powerful, it is not only a must 
		for anyone going through a challenging recovery, but can also benefit 
		those of us who yearn to connect with the awe, magnificence, and meaning 
		of life.
