    aloha to wellness - mālama mushrooms


 november 1, 2024

the most common question when the topic goes to functional mushroom products tends to be: “are these magic mushrooms?” well, this hawai’i based company is determined to prove that all mushrooms are magic. while these aren't psilocybin-containing hallucinogenic mushrooms (most commonly referred to when talking about ‘magic’ mushrooms), their healthful effects are just as remarkable.                                                                                     mālama mushrooms is a family-owned business based in kona, hawaii, dedicated to promoting health and wellness through the power of superfood mushrooms. founded by benjamin lillibridge in 2015, the brand’s name, "mālama," meaning "protect, preserve, and nurture" in hawaiian, reflects the company’s core mission of sharing the healing properties of mushrooms.                                                                                     residents in the pacific northwest are probably most initiated with the wonder of mushrooms. but for those new to the party, welcome! now let’s give you some ‘mush’ needed context: mushrooms have been used for targeting a prodigious number of ailments and maladies in traditional cultures medicinal regimes throughout the world spanning millennia. the conventional western world, in their typical resistance to harnessing the holistic capabilities of earth’s natural intelligence, has been a tad slower to embrace. however, fungi had their historic watershed moment in america during wwii when the power of a lowly fungus, penicillium spp., was utilized to create the first industrially scaled anti-biotic, penicillin, and deployed to the allied troops and eventually the rest of the world. this had a dramatic effect on reducing mortality from infections.                                                                                     today, the literature surrounding fungi such as functional superfood mushrooms such as lion’s mane, reishi, cordyceps & chaga has expanded immensely.                                                                                     lion’s mane                                               - known for its cognitive benefits, lion’s mane is often referred to as a “brain booster”. it supports memory, focus, and mental clarity, and has been shown to promote nerve regeneration. its antiinflammatory properties may also reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimer’s and parkinson’s. lion’s mane is a great option for anyone looking to enhance brain health and overall cognitive function for themselves, their family and even their dog!                                                                                                              reishi                                              - nicknamed the “mushroom of immortality” reishi is revered for its stress- relieving and immune-boosting properties. it helps calm the mind, improve sleep quality, and strengthen the immune system. reishi is also known for its anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits, making it ideal for supporting overall well-being.                                                                                     cordyceps                                               - cordyceps is celebrated for its ability to boost energy and enhance athletic performance. by improving oxygen uptake and increasing stamina, it’s a popular choice for athletes or those seeking a natural energy boost without a crash. it is also linked to improved lung function and anti-aging benefits.                                                                  chaga - packed with antioxidants, chaga is a powerful mushroom that supports immune function and combats oxidative stress. it is also renowned for its ability to promote skin health by fighting free radicals and supporting cellular regeneration.                                                                                     mālama mushrooms crafts a variety of products that make it easy to incorporate these powerful mushrooms into your daily routine. whether you’re looking to improve cognitive function, enhance your immune system, or reduce stress, there’s a mālama product designed to support your health goals.                                                                                     in line with their commitment to quality, mālama uses organic, fruiting bodies of the mushrooms, a method aligned with traditional practices which does not include any of the oats & rice substrate used in the growing process.                                                                                     but it’s not just obsession with quality that makes mālama aligned with their namesake of ‘protecting, preserving & nurturing’. the company also donates 5% of profits to the hawaii fungi project, a non-profit dedicated to studying and preserving the native hawaiian mushrooms, some of which are already on the iucn’s endangered species list and have seldom been seen by human eyes. in addition, during the maui fires last year, one of their mushroom farm partners lost 70% of the accounts they sold fresh lion’s mane to overnight. mālama sprang into action and began dehydrating & extracting their mushrooms to incorporate into their product line and support.
