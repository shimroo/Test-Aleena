 therapy thursdays
god can handle it!  he doesn't want the king james version of what's bothering you. god want's you to keep it real with him.  the real question is can you handle it? "but the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth, for the father is seeking such people to worship him." ... the father is looking for those who will worship him that way."" john 4:23
