welcome to
mosquito control
mosquito control of michigan, inc. is a michigan based company located in southeastern michigan. we proudly serve livingston, macomb, monroe, oakland, st. clair, washtenaw and wayne counties. we offer backyard mosquito control services for residential, event, commercial and municipal applications. most applications take only 20 minutes, but if you have a larger property it may take a little longer. once we are done applying all you need to do is wait 30-45 minutes for the treatment to dry and then you can enjoy it once more. fortunately our product is not removed by rain. we use an organic elastic film (enblock™) that helps protect it from washing away with rain, breaking down with the sun or wearing off by leaves rubbing due to wind. however, if the weather negatively effects your treatment all you need to do is give us a call, and we will return and apply another treatment. if the forecast calls for heavy or consistent rain or high winds that day, we will reschedule to protect the integrity of the application.
