*are ancient myths works of fiction, or do they contain details
of real historic events and events in the earth's history?
*have the earth's features been developed gradually over
millions of years purely by the processes we see today, or
have catastrophic upheavals played a major part?
*has the solar system undergone upheavals during historic
times and does electricity play a much bigger role in the
cosmos than currently thought?
*ancient egyptian history has formed the basis for the
chronologies of most ancient civilisations, but have the
egyptologists got it wrong? have they falsely inflated it with
'ghost' centuries and rulers, generating corresponding
distortions in all the surrounding areas? 


"by catastrophism i mean any form of geological speculation which... supposes the operation of forces different in their nature... from those which we at present see in action." huxley in sci. opinion 21 april 1869 (464/1).

perilous planet earth: catastrophes and catastrophism through the ages by trevor palmer. hardback, 522 pages 8 line diagrams 35 half-tones 1 table, isbn: 0521819288. [buy]

perilous planet earth places our present concern about the threat to earth from asteroids and comets within an historical context, looking at the evidence for past events within the geological and historical records. the book looks at the way in which prevailing views about modes of global change have changed dramatically over the years. it also considers the way in which catastrophic events are now seen to have influenced the course of evolution in the distant past, as well as the rise and fall of civilisations in more recent times. professor palmer argues that the better we understand our past, the greater the likelihood that we will be able to take appropriate action to preserve our civilisation for the future. written in an engaging style that avoids jargon, the book will appeal to general readers and academics with an interest in evolution, geology, astronomy, social anthropology and history.
