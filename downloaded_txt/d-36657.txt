warning!!!
the following pages will more than likely contain
         stuff that will shock and offend you. they also,
         incidentally, have absolutely no socially redeeming value
         whatsoever. enter at your own risk. and kiddies, check with
         your parents before entering, because there's a lot of lewd
         material in here that will almost certainly corrupt your
         values.
all pages and information inside the konformist
         are free to copy, and you are encouraged to do so, provided
         it is for non-commercial purposes and copy provides the
         proper attribute. feel free to spread the word on the
         hottest site on the web.

         and sign up. or, e-mail konformist-subscribe@yahoogroups.com
         with the subject: "i need 2 konform!!!" (okay, you can use

the konformist offers a konspiracy theory du jour,
         tantalizing the paranoid with new takes on the latest

hey kids, don't forget to enter the "rockin' to
         armageddon sweepstakes", sponsored by the konformist,
         the official internet underground magazine of the super bowl
         xlvi. (okay, it's not official, but we're anti-authority
         anyways.) write down the day, month, year, and time of the
         end of the world, and, as a tie-breaker, your nominee for
         the anti-christ. the winner will receive a t-shirt stating,
         "i came closest to predicting the apocalypse, and all i got
         was this crummy t-shirt." you will also receive a free one
         year supply of reese's peanut butter cups.
by the way, this is a free magazine, but we'll still take
         your money if you want. please send cash, check, money
         orders, and credit card numbers (visa, master card, american
