top 5 benefits of having a home based business





1. the first and foremost major benefit of having your own home based business during the first two to three years is the income tax savings involved. an average family of 4 with 2 teenage children normally save in the area of $2,000 to $5,000 each year.there is a possibility that you could save much more than $5,000, it all depends on your gross family income. this is all tax free savings and will put this much cash in your pocket come next year at income tax time!2. another major benefit is the personal freedom involved. if you need more money, you simply work harder.3. time freedom. what is the most important aspect of life, after health of course? in my opinion...it is time. all the money in the world is no good to you unless you have time to spend with your loved ones. most people in the corporate world that are six figure income earners would be happy to take a pay cut in order to spend more time with their friends and families.4. less stress. being your own boss has it's advantages. if you don't produce, the only person suffering is yourself. there is no-one looking over your shoulder all day and expecting more from you than you can give.5. the end result. instead of your personal creativity putting cash in the pockets of others, you are keeping the "fruits of your own labor".in summary, if you don't have a home based business of your own you are giving time and money away to others. can you really afford to do this?   by: john jarvis

starting a new business in a small town





q. i am a former pastor who left the ministry after sixteen years to spend more time with my family. we moved to a very small town (less than ten thousand people) and i want to start an internet caf&eactute business and also offer pc repair. how can i investigate and then promote this business?a. in a big city, you'll make decisions by numbers and neighborhoods. in a small town, you schmooze!on the surface, everyone will be friendly, optimistic and positive.your challenge: get below the surface and learn the true story. you might consider asking a lot of questions before you disclose your own intentions. listen for, "i wish we had"1. talk to others who have opened businesses recently.what challenges have they faced? what works and what doesn't? were others newcomers successful? if so, were they truly new or did they have deep roots in the town, such as a brother who lived here forty years?if nobody's opened a business for awhile, dig deeper. maybe there's no market. or maybe they're just waiting for you to arrive! sometimes a new business can generate latent demand. it's a judgment call.2. make a great first impression.promotion isn't hard in a small town. ten minutes after you've opened, everyone will know! some towns resist doing business with uppity newcomers. others welcome new blood. regardless, your first impression will linger a long, long time. and you'll have trouble recovering from a local opinion leader with a bad experience.3. uncover the town's market and memory.considering buying a business? take time to discover the owner's reputation. when the local residents seem eager for a change of management, you'll need a new name and image. but if someone's just moved away and everyone misses them, you've got a wonderful opportunity. right now in silver city we could use a few first-rate pet-sitters and dog groomers.but be sensitive to change. before i moved here, i'm told, at least three coffee shops failed. now we have several, along with a wine bar and a microbrewery. all seem to be thriving.4. search the fine print of local regulations.here in silver city, our newest businesses had to fight all kinds of red tape to get opened. one called city hall to get help with a business that was new to the area. "it's not listed here," said the clerk, "so it's probably illegal." (the business has opened and thrives.) another discovered his license hadn't come through because the council forgot to add it to the agendaand they weren't interested in making last-minute changes.any time you serve food or drink, you know you're facing permits. find out what's involved locally.5. prepare to do most of the work yourself.in a small town, you can have trouble finding good help. the local work ethic may surprise you -- in either direction.6. know your community.will your market come from second and third generation local residents? or are you serving those who relocated recently from urban areas? here i've met folks who think three dollars is way too much to pay for espresso drinks. but those who bonded with starbucks will buy at least one cup a day, every day.7. build relationships.if you can attract a town leader, you'll draw a following. conversely, if you inadvertently alienate a key player, or if a local person's got an idea on the drawing board, you'll be miserable.and in a small town, you'll be expected to be a super-citizen. choose alliances and sponsorships carefully. prepare for all sorts of friendly requests to donate time, materials and money.   by: cathy goodwin, ph.d.

is home business really a business?





home business, doesn't it strikes you? but then another question hammers in your mind, whether it is a credible & lucrative business just like others? this is a never ending argument between successful and botched people who tried this business. do you know that only 2 % people are successful in home business and 98% are failures. can you think of who are those 2 percenters. successors?why majority people are botched? let me discuss some core issues about home business.what is the home business?a business you can operate from your home in flexible hrs. you will be your own boss. there is only a small investment and above all you can work with world's top marketing companies. you can earn decent money for your efforts and knowledge.who is the right person to do it?in my opinion everybody can do this business, who have a strong urge to do something with certain level of commitment and dedication. but one can generate a handsome income only after having accumulated a reasonable knowledge about marketing techniques, knowledge of your target audience/market and certainly latest promotional tools, because internet is the fastest way to market your products and services. a good knowledge of email marketing, websites and search engines will be additives to your income & success. you must be innovative and creative while marketing your products and services. there are no set rules, every successful marketers have developed their own strategies. you will also learn when you decide not to quit but to persist your enthu to succeed.is it worth to invest money in home business?yes! i say yes, if you are really serious about this business you have to invest some money wisely just like any other business. for eg. if you are planning to open a shop, you need space at a high traffic area, you need some hot selling products, you have to do some interior to make it attractive and last but not least you have to advertise your business to get customers. all the above requires wealth/capital to invest. right! same basic rule also applies in home business.why 98% peoples fails?this is a naked and callous truth about home business that 98 % people are failures. the foremost reason is lack of knowledge, patience and earnestness. most of the people joins network marketing companies to earn quick money without doing anything. they endeavor it for few months and then give up. they never attempt to learn the right techniques and strategies, they only want some quick bucks. they don't be bothered for their customers or downline. they are reluctant to solve the problems of their customers and downline, which results in dissatisfaction and frustration and then finally surrender. this ends the business in itself because "u" ultimately will end up with no earning and get only a ruined business.who are the successful 2 percenters?these 2 per centers are the people who never quit and have faith in themselves. they learn from their mistakes and imbibe a lot more from apex of these businesses. they motivate themselves endlessly and help others in their downline to achieve the same. they are taking towering risk as they know that nothing comes without efforts. they strive to imitate and generate new ideas from their upline and other successful marketers. they always welcome new ideas, believes in acceptance, always ready to take risk, and have a "never say die" attitude. believes strongly in "if someone can earn, then why can't i?"why more and more people are going for it?according to my study and observation, a lot more individuals are looking for home business opportunities and the only one main reason is "time". today maximum no. of populace is fed up of their working schedules, jobs and lifestyle. there is no time for the family, oneself and/or society. a hate feeling has developed for routine 9 to 6 hrs job as the maximum times goes in commutation (3-4 hrs. daily) from home to office and then office to home. after a long drenching day reached home fully exhausted and frustrated. so the idea of home business always fascinates them. they would have always dreamt about it. that's why every 45 second someone has joined the home business worldwide. it is an alarming figure and more and more people opt home business as substitute earning source. you know 90% of the working mothers don't have more then 2 hrs daily for their kids. this is very provoking for both mothers and kids, their family bonding is at a risk. the only solution for this problem is owning home business where one can not only earn well but also have a suffice time for family and oneself.in my opinion everybody has a right to live freely and must devote enough time with their family. so joining a home business is really good decision but mind you, you have to work smartly and not hard. now a days a lot of successful marketers are ready to share their secrets with you and you get all valuable information for just a few bucks. if you are really thinking about to start a home business consider some points before you join:1) check the company's reputation, their promoters their products and existence of company and track record.2) check if the company paying their affiliates timely.3) is the products are really good quality.4) is your upline supportive.once you verify the above points, go and join it and start working as this is your own business. if you are determined and ready to learn, you will definitely win.best of luck for your successful home business.   by: by: amar srivastava

hard work - an unknown concept in homebased business?





as i sit here in front of the fire and tv at 8.30pm on a wednesday evening, many would be mistaken for thinking that working from home is easy. but then that is before you take into account my daily routine:i get up at around 7.45am and feed the cats and sheep, make myself a cup of tea and then by 8.30am i am sat in front of my computer collecting my emails and responding to the numerous enquiries for more information on my mlm business.then after an hour i start my daily traffic exchange surfing, forum posting, yahoo group blasting and so on....this daily routine of promotion and advertising takes me until around lunch time. the afternoon is then taken up following up prospects, updating my websites and checking and responding to further emails. i usually finish for the day at around 6pm, although i always leave the computer on and check my emails again before turning in for the night.i work longer hours now that i work full time from home on my mlm business than i did when i worked a normal day job. then i started at 9am, leaving the house at around 8.40am, i had an hour for lunch and a couple of breaks through the day and finished at 5.15am, being back by 5.30pm. now i start at 8.30am and finish at 6pm with the odd trip downstairs to make a cup of tea and half an hour for lunch.of course i wouldn't and don't think i could go back to working for someone else and doing a 'usual' 9 til 5 job but why do people think working from home is easy. and why are so many people scared of putting in some good old fashioned hard work to make their homebased business a success.working from home, whether you are in a mlm program, an affiliate program or running your own website, selling your own product, promotion, getting sales and following up prospects all takes time and effort. you must put in the time and effort needed to get your business off the ground, you must do the promotion required to get those sales, you must follow up with your customers, update your website and answer emails and so on.anyone who joins an affiliate program, becomes a distributor for a mlm company or starts their own home based business must be prepared to work at it, and usually work much harder than you would going to the office each day and working for someone else.if you are afraid of a little hard work, then do not attempt to start you own home based business because the bottom line is you will fail. if hard work is a dirty concept to you, stick to working for someone else.if you are prepared to put in the hard slog and really work at it, then you will find working from home very rewarding and in the long run, be it one, two or three years down the line, you will be successful. and your success will be proportional to the hard work you put in at the beginning.stick at it....you will succeed.   by: rachel gawith

are you ready to start a business?





are you ready to start a business? take this quiz and see.don't get discouraged! a "no" answer to any of the questions will identify an area for development -- not a roadblock. i am available to help if you would like to discuss your options in greater detail.(1) do you offer a clear, unambiguous benefit that your target market can't live without?ideally you can learn whether demand exists for your service. otherwise, don't dive in. dip a toe into the water to see if it's warm.(2) can you demonstrate expertise?collect testimonials, references, products and awards. credentials help only if clients believe they make a difference.(3) do you have evidence that people will pay for your services? for instance, you may have achieved expertise in a certain type of healing where the going rate is $15 an hour. .(4) is your market crowded with competitors?if it's hard to stand out, you need a network of personal contacts to get started. and if the quality of your competitors varies, much of your business will depend on referrals.(5) do you have networks of people who can become clients or referral sources?for instance, are you a cpa whose clients pick your brain for career change and business start-ups? do you belong to professional groups that will give you access to a mailing list?if so, you may have a straightforward transition to your new business.(6) have you ever(a) been self-employed or(b) been successful at a straight-commission sales job?if you dropped out of a sales job because you couldn't handle the uncertainty, you need an exceptionally generous safety net before you embark on your own solo venture.(7) are you at home on the internet?do you understand the principles of web design, so you can do-it-yourself or work intelligently with a designer?a website is a commitment, especially for service businesses. you have to be your own designer, marry a designer, or have a big maintenance budget.(8) are you active in a community that is large enough to include potential clients and referrers?it is possible to have a lucrative distance business, but it takes longer and requires unique marketing skills.(9) are you comfortable in a sales role? when someone calls to inquire about your services, are you willing to view your task as selling as well as helping, analyzing or troubleshooting?(10 ) how much continuity exists between your former career and your new business?professions have norms and values. the greater the distance, the more challenging will be your journey, and the greater the risk and time to achieve. you may have to learn a new way of thinking about the world.and you truly may not be able to go home again.   by: cathy goodwin, ph.d.
