(commonly asked in security screening). if the former reactions are greater, the examinee passes; if the latter are greater, he fails. if responses to both "control" and relevant questions are about the same, the result is deemed inconclusive.the test also includes irrelevant questions such as, "are the lights on in this room?" the polygrapher falsely explains that such questions provide a "baseline for truth," because the true answer is obvious. but in reality, they are not scored at all! they merely serve as buffers between pairs of relevant and "control" questions.the simplistic methodology used in polygraph testing has no grounding in the scientific method: it is no more scientific than astrology or tarot cards. government agencies value it because people who don't realize it's a fraud sometimes make damaging admissions. but as a result of reliance on this voodoo science, the truthful are often falsely branded as liars while the deceptive pass through.perversely, the "test" is inherently biased against the truthful, because the more honestly one answers the "control" questions, and as a consequence feels less stress when answering them, the more likely one is to fail. conversely, liars can beat the test by covertly augmenting their physiological reactions to the "control" questions. this can be done, for example, by doing mental arithmetic, thinking exciting thoughts, altering one's breathing pattern, or simply biting the side of the tongue. truthful persons can also use these techniques to protect themselves against the risk of a false positive outcome. although polygraph operators frequently claim they can detect such countermeasures, no polygrapher has ever demonstrated any ability to do so, and peer-reviewed research suggests that they can't.latest news:cvsa con man charles humble sued for fraud (again)former arkansas department of corrections employee trayesha booth has filed a lawsuit against charles humble and his companies, nitv, llc and nitv federal services, lcc.ukraine enacts polygraph requirement for foreigners seeking to join armed forceswhat could possibly go wrong?cbp drops questions about illegal drug use from pre-employment polygraph screeninga moderator of the u.s. government-controlled reddit community r/borderpatrolapplicant writes that as of january 2025, u.s. customs and border protection will no longer ask applicants about drug use during pre-employment polygraph screening.possible polygraph dragnet in investigation of leak of classified documents on israeli preparations to attack irana leak investigation is almost certainly underway concerning the appearance of highly classified u.s. intelligence community documents on a private telegram channel. a polygraph dragnet to identify the leaker may ensue.oakland city council budgets $800,000 for polygraph screening of police applicantsroselyn romero reports for the oaklandside that the city council of oakland, california, has approved contracts totaling $800,000 to two private companies for the polygraph screening of oakland police department applicants.steve wilkes show guest kandie meinhart passed polygraph but pleaded guilty to murder of infant daughteron thursday, 18 july 2024, kandie alisha meinhart of delaware county, pennsylvania, in a plea agreement pleaded guilty to third degree murder in connection with the death of her infant daughter, li'aziah thomas, and was sentenced to 30-60 years in prison. meinhart had previously professed innocence in the matter.s.f. chronicle publishes investigative report into use of cvsa by law enforcement agencieson tuesday, 4 june 2024, the san francisco chronicle published a well-researched investigative article by susie neilson and matthias gafni on the use of the computer voice stress analyzer (cvsa) by law enforcement agencies, especially in the state of california.confessed spy alexander yuk ching ma evidently did not beat the polygraphon 18 august 2020, antipolygraph.org reported that alexander yuk ching ma, a former cia officer and fbi contract linguist charged with espionage, had evidently beaten the polygraph to penetrate the fbi. it now seems clear that this was not the case.california department of corrections and rehabilitation phasing out cvsaantipolygraph.org has confirmed with the california department of corrections and rehabilitation (cdcr), that its office of peace officer selection, which in 2016 began using computer voice stress analysis (cvsa) to screen applicants, terminated this practice in may of 2023.dr. wes boyd on physicians being forced to submit to polygraph "testing"some state physician health programs are compelling physicians with or suspected of having substance use disorders to submit to polygraph "testing."polygraph evidence at issue in alex murdaugh's federal sentencingfederal prosecutors are attempting to revoke a plea agreement based on an allegedly failed polygraph "test."government-controlled reddit community for border patrol applicants bans discussion of polygraphstalk about polygraphy is now verboten on r/borderpatrolapplicant.virginia polygraph board unanimously rejects cvsait appears that cvsa will not be approved for use in the state of virginia.
