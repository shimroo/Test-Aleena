ft4 powder rheometer®
comprehensive powder flow characterisation 
the ft4, the flagship product from freeman technology, is a universal powder flow tester. the range of measurement capabilities the ft4 provides makes it the world's most versatile powder testing instrument for measuring and understanding powder flow and powder behaviour. if you work with powders, either in a research or production capacity, the ft4 can provide valuable information about powder flow properties and other behavioural characteristics of your materials that other technologies simply don’t deliver

powder rheology
understanding powder flow and powder behaviour
there is no single measurable parameter that defines how a powder will flow, mix, feed, granulate, fill, convey, compress or behave in any other process operation. our powder testing instrumentation is designed to help users in the field solve their powder handling challenges

working with powders
powders are blends of solids, liquids and gases, usually air, and their flow properties may be affected by perhaps 30 or more factors. these include particle characteristics such as size, shape and surface properties, environmental factors such as air content, temperature and vibration, and chemical interactions leading to adhesion and caking

                            i've never ever had any experience with any other instrument that was so positive as with the ft4 powder tester.

                            i use the ft4 to answer most all of my powder characterization questions and wouldn’t have it any other way. thank you to freeman technology for enriching the capabilities of my laboratory and helping us solve our applied powder application questions.

                            if we’re considering a new supplier or a customer brings us a new powder to print with, then we can determine with a high degree of confidence whether it will work and if so how to process it, simply from test data. without the ft4 this just wasn’t possible.

                            when powder testing unlocks throughput gains like this it can easily deliver savings of up to 50 – 100 times the cost of the instrument.
