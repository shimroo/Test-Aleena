(sold) item b0009 - mara flocked carpet handbag by tocca with broken zipper



















$3.50
this bag definitely needs the zipper on the front repaired (the zipper teeth won't stay closed) and the back zipper may need repair eventually as the bag was filled to capacity during its use. other than that, it's in "move-in condition" --a bit worn around the edges and not spotless, but clean nonetheless.check with your local shoe repair or tailor shop for a ballpark figure on zipper replacement to factor into the cost of purchasing this bag.if you know how to replace the zipper yourself, this is an especially amazing bargain for a tocca bag.
