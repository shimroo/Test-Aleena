what our clients say 










						heidi did an amazing job. we are very pleased with her local knowledge and professionalism. she knew a lot about construction and the land, the environment, and many important things on our list. she was always there for any questions we may have concerning the area or the purchasing of the home. i would highly recommend her. 
					
home buyer 








						my experience working with heidi was magical, to say the least. she is highly skilled, kind, resourceful, patient, and very on top of her game. we listed our property and got offers after two showings and sold our property within a few weeks of going on the market. i would highly recommend anyone to work with her for all your real estate needs as she knows her stuff and is able to get the job done smoothly and as stress-free as possible. mahalo nui, heidi!					
home seller 








						heidi is an impressive real estate agent. she and her team were always available for check-ins and questions during the process of selling our home which was very comforting. our sale involved some peculiarities that came up during the process and i felt that she and her team were always on top of it and moving things forward. heidi was very good at navigating competing offers and we were able to sell our house for more than we anticipated in a very short time and in a changing market. she was on our side the whole time but also came across as fair to all parties so i would recommend her for anyone buying or selling property.
