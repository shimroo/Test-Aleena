          artists as varied as the classic sir william russell flint and j w waterhouse, 
          the elusive sara moon,
          the fantasy women of boris vallejo, the lingerie and bikini-clad sensations 
          of alberto vargas and so much more
 you'll find galleries dedicated to inspirational photography - images that beg to be artworks.

          are pages dedicated to my (illustrated) thoughts on the sensual world 
          of art, including my art tutorial
          offering some thoughts on how you may begin to capure a little of the 
          magic for yourself.

"welcome 
  to sensual-arts.com. few things in life are capable of stiring human emotion 
  with such remarkable diversity, as is the female form. in my life, i have come 
  to recognindition as a three-cornered paradox, with beauty, glamour 
  and p8rn8gr8phy at each of its extremes. within those elusive boundaries each 
  of us has our own 'sensual zone' ... this website is dedicated to mine."
