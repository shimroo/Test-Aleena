here at cardiff high school the metaphor of light is an important one, since this is a school that strives for the highest educational standards. the school motto tua'r goleuni, or towards the light, reflects the school's aspiration to assist all our pupils to fulfil their individual potential, to find new talents and to develop a love for learning.
please note that the school website is currently being updated with an anticipated completion date of january 2025. in the meantime, please excuse any gaps in information you may find.
