the earglassesâ® story
invented by a music lover
these elegantly simple and inexpensive 
little acoustic lenses boost the volume 
of any sounds that you face. they also 
block noises that may come from your 
side or your back. 
and they do all this for less than $7 per 
ear! they work in a completely natural 
way. no batteries or cheap electronics 
get in the way of helping you to hear 
more. they can even improve how some 
ite hearing aids sound. 
this device is so unique, it's been 
awarded two united states utility 
patents. more than one hundred 
thousand sets have been sold in the 
united states alone in the past 20 years.



âiâm afraid that they may 
make me look sillyâ
if youâre worried about how you 
will look when you wear them, just 
use earglassesâ® at home to listen 
to music or watch tv. but you may 
be pleasantly surprised at how 
people react when they see you 
wearing them at the movies, in 
church, or at a play or a concert, 
anywhere you want to hear better. 
our braver users consistently 
report that strangers are just as 
likely to ask where to get their own 
earglassesâ® lenses as to comment 
on their distinctive appearance.




to hear what earglassesâ® acoustic lenses can do 
to help you to hear more, just cup your hands 
behind your ears. earglassesâ® work the same 
way. but they do even better, because your 
arms won't get tired!
