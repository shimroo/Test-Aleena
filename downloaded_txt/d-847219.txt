know thyself:  the pathway to ascension  to multi-dimensional selfhood
in order to “know thyself,” we must seek the truth about ourselves and our  entire human family.

a galactic society  – the fulfillment
of the american declaration of independence
       the occupation of wall street in the usa  and the demonstrations taking place all over planet earth are indications that  people are awakening and demanding change.   we, the people of the world, are declaring  our independence.  this time, our  independence is not simply to enable us to build peaceful, prospering nations,  but the foundation upon which we are to build our galactic culture and to be  re-united with our galactic brothers and sisters... read more
following our individual    road map to ascension
life is eternal for the soul—no  beginning, no ending.  many souls choose  to explore the various dimensions of life, rather than remain in the heavenly  realms.  those of us presently residing  on earth made that choice.  during our  explorations, we made mistakes that require correction—karma that necessitates  transmuting into positive energy.  in  order for us to achieve ascension into the higher dimensions, these mistakes  must be resolved on earth plane.
as a result, when preparing for another  physical incarnation, we and our spiritual mentors construct a road map to guide our soul  along its chosen path.  this road  map also involves contracting with additional souls to play particular roles in  the forthcoming incarnation.  these soul  contracts are created to ensure that we accomplish the goals upon which we are  basing our future physical plane life.  (read whole article....)
 
preparing for 2012
earth is to become an ascended planet!
you & i determine how it will be
transformed.
tremendous
changes are taking place on our planet, in the solar system, within our milky
way galaxy, and the cosmos.  2012 marks the end of time as we know it.  once
more we are to attune to fractal timecycles within ever increasing cycles. 
december
21, 2012 signals the end of a 5,125-year cycle of time called a world age.  
the last humans to experience the shift of a world age lived in 3114 b.c.  it
is for this reason that we find it difficult to believe that we incarnated to
assist in this momentous shift to another world age.
the
soul of every individual on this planet chose to be present and to assist earth
in making this shift into the the new earth and the new heaven.  many have
forgotten that goal.  it is time to awaken to our soul purpose!
2012
also signifies the end of a 25,625-year cycle, called the precession of the
equinoxesearths journey through the 12 constellations of the zodiac.   each
25,625-year cycle contains 5 world age cycles.
according
to gregg braden, in his book fractal time, the closing of each of the previous
world ages is preserved in earths geological record.  each of the preceding
world ages ended with a great cataclysm:  the first with earthquakes and the
sinking of continents, the second with the earth covered in ice, and the third
with a great flood.  2012 ends this fourth world age.   we, who presently live
on this planet, will soon be living in the fifth world age and the age of
aquarius.
it is up to us to determine how this fourth
world age will end.
we have no time to waste!         (read more...)
 
bridging the gap in our changing world

  by nancy b. detweiler, m.ed., m.div.
our world is  changing at an unprecedented speed—literally everything is changing!
our belief systems  are undergoing a major shift.  this shift  is freeing for some, frightening for others.
many christians  have been taught to fear anything denoting the new age.  a part of this fear is due to living on earth  in a very unique period—the end of several cycles of thousands of years  duration.  this is a new experience for  us.  we were excited over the approach of  the 21st  century and its  potential discoveries because our history books talk about centuries.  but to think in terms of a new world age  thousands of years in duration is beyond our conscious comprehension.  as a result, we tend to react in fear and  disbelief.  
our educational  systems have not routinely taught fractal time.   to think in terms of life being cyclical (fractal) is new to most of us,  even though the old testament book of ecclesiastes speaks of these cycles.   for example:   “whosoever speaks and says, ‘look, this is new, should know that it  already has been in the ages which were before us.”  (ecclesiastes 1:10)  “that which is now, already has been; and  that which is to be, has already been.”   (ecclesiastes 3:15)  we read these  words and think only in terms of “history repeats itself” as we ponder the last  few centuries.  we comprehend the bible  only in terms of what we have been taught or learned on our own.  ecclesiastes is speaking of ages that are  beyond our comprehension unless we have studied fractal time and know that time  is measured in ever widening cycles.
it is the same  with the rest of the bible.  most  christians read it through the lens of traditional religious teachings and  thereby miss much actually contained within the bible.  it’s like learning a “new” word … we don’t  remember seeing the word until one day we do notice it and look up its  definition in the dictionary.   thereafter, we are surprised at how frequently we see the word because  it is now a part of our conscious knowledge.   this limited method of reading the bible has rendered most christians  unprepared for the shift in ages that is now taking place. 
in 1997, i  published a book written especially to assist christians during this time of  transition into a new cycle of time—a new world age.  a new age christian:  my spiritual journey is the account of my  journey from traditional teachings to an expanded view of life and its  purposes.  my book is the result of  decades of biblical, historical, and metaphysical research.  it contains 274 endnotes that provide  additional information and resources you can use to do your own research.  
a new age  christian can assist christians in expanding traditional teachings to include  the new truths that are coming forth as the new world age approaches.  as our intentional spiritual expansion  occurs, we overcome fear and experience a level of freedom that we have not  known.  
 
a new age christian:  my  spiritual journey
  nancy b. detweiler, m.ed., m.div.
i have posted on my website the two chapters i consider of major 
  importance: "astrology: sacred or taboo," and "reincarnation in the 
  bible."
why these two chapters? because the vatican's condemnation of astrology in
  the late 15th century and its declaration of reincarnation as heresy in
  553 c.e. at the 5th ecumenical council have deprived christians of the
  ability to know who we are as unique expressions of god. this deprivation
  means we have been more easily controlled by the power elite. it has also
  deprived us of the means to seek in depth understanding of ourselves and
  all that is held within our subconscious minds. it has deprived us of the
  answers to our "why?" questions regarding understanding our own lives and
  that of others. it has resulted in untold suffering that did not have to
  be.

ascension
nancy b. detweiler
for eons, the spiritual journey of humanity has involved alternating spans of
      time between life in a physical body and life on the plane of spirit. living
      within a physical body entails limitations that do not exist during the
      intervening periods on the spiritual plane.

when we enter a physical body, we leave behind most memories of prior
      lifetimes on earth. by age 4 or 5, most of us have forgotten our experiences on
      the plane of spirit. the reasons for our soul’s choice to enter another
      physical body are buried within our subconscious minds. we begin to view the
      present incarnation as the only time we have, or will, experience life on earth.
      sadly, our societal institutions allow us—even encourage us—to remain in
      this amnesic state of consciousness. the inevitable result is that we feel
      separated from god and cut off from the root of our being. not knowing where our
      roots extend, we view every part of creation as separate from ourselves. we
      stand alone on an empty island.
we embark on the process of ascension when we open our conscious awareness to
      comprehending the truth about ourselves and all of creation. we can never learn
      all there is to know; however, with each new awareness we ascend into fuller
      consciousness.
most persons presently incarnated on earth have thus far—consciously or
      unconsciously—chosen to follow "the broad path," meaning to meander
      their way into an expanded consciousness. to walk the broad path is permissible
      and will eventually achieve the same desired goal. on the other hand, many are
      choosing to tread the "narrow path" that requires a dedicated and
      conscious intention to pursue a continuing unfolding of higher consciousness—an
      awareness that extends into the higher realms of spirit and allows for the
      existence of an unending cosmos of living beings. the narrow path takes us
      straight up the mountain. the difference in the disciplinary effort involved is
      easily understood by comparing two approaches to the summit. one, we can choose
      to slowly walk around and around the mountain, gradually reaching the top, or
      two, we can climb the strenuous, rocky path straight up the mountain. either
      way, all will eventually attain the goal of ascension.
the major events in the life of jesus reveal the narrow path to ascension.
      the narrow path is the way of initiation and service to others. jesus incarnated
      at the beginning of the piscean age to show us the way on the path of
      initiation. it has taken humanity an entire age (2000+ years) to reach the stage
      of consciously desiring to ascend into a higher realization of truth. we now
      stand on the brink of a tremendous shift in perception. this shift will lift
      planet earth and its inhabitants from the 3rd dimensional, physical
      plane of awareness to the 5th dimensional realization of a new heaven
      and a new earth.
no negativity can enter the 5th dimension. it is for this reason
      that each of us must walk either the broad path or the narrow path into 5th dimensional consciousness. ascension takes place as we become beings of light
      and love, attuned to the divinity within, and cognizant that we are one with all
      that is. jesus showed us the way to accomplish this transformation of self by
      undergoing the 5 initiations within public view.

“love one another”
      john 13:34
service to others,  asking nothing in return, is a major way by which we “love one another.”  
true loving  service is oriented toward meeting the needs of others ascertained by listening  to their individual stories, then planning accordingly.  all people desire to be independent … to care  for themselves and their families … to live in peace.  the frustrations that hamper some from  fulfilling these common desires may lead to self-defeating, even dangerous,  behaviors.  still … all persons are  worthy of experiencing the inalienable rights granted to them by our creator  god as uniquely talented human beings.    we truly serve when we assist them in doing so.
as our planet  moves toward ascension into higher consciousness, let us evaluate how our  efforts to love one another … to be of service to others … can be more  effectively rendered.  let us seek out  the individual stories of frustrations … listen to the yearnings of individuals  for their own unique avenues of becoming all they can be … strive to understand  all sides of a conflict rather than take sides one against another—calling one  “ally” and the other “enemy.”  every  nation on earth is peopled with unique individuals, who when given the opportunity  and means to do so desire to create a happy, fulfilling life for themselves and  their family.

the awakened christian
nancy b. detweiler
for seventeen hundred years, the christian religion has abided by a set of
            doctrines created by men dedicated to standardizing the acceptable beliefs
            concerning the nature of the source of our being and of jesus. the resulting
            codified religion leaves little or no room for christians to seek truth on their
            own. reprimands, accusations of heresy, excommunication, and loss of job,
            family, and/or friends hover in the shadows ready to pounce on anyone daring to
            explore our magnificent world by going outside the traditional christian
            doctrines. fear stifles our innate curiosity to learn more about the source of
            our being and where we, as humans, fit into the divine scheme of cosmic life.
christians are taught to read the bible as the word of god and to
            interpret it in accordance with the codified church doctrines. a literal
            interpretation of the scriptures results in a multitude of horrifying teachings
            concerning the nature of our source and of human beings. little do we realize
            that our concept of god and ourselves forms the philosophical foundation for our
            relationship to each other and to our planet. we have created a god in our own
            misguided image of self and it is not a pretty sight. this god is a warrior who
            fights on one side or the other, is bloodthirsty and without compassion when it
            comes to killing the enemy including women and children. we have created a god
            who is far less than the average human being. this god is unforgiving and plans
            eternal punishment for those who do not abide by the accepted doctrines of the
            christian cult (a cult is defined as a system of beliefs to which its adherents
            cling out of fear and for a sense of security and assurance about the future
            life). human beings created a god separate from self, a god to whom we pray and
            can only hope he hears. if he does hear, we never know how he will respond. we
            do not know the meaning of the apostle paul’s statement to the greeks in
            athens: "in him we live and move and have our being." (acts 17:28)
the writer of i john reveals our source of being: "god is love, and
            those who abide in love abide in god, and god abides in them…. there is no
            fear in love, but perfect love casts our fear; for fear has to do with
            punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. we love
            because he first loved us. the commandment we have from him is this: those who
            love god must love their brothers and sisters also." (i john 4:16, 18-19,
            21)
