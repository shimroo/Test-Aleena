testimonials





pilates movement has been my therapy for close to 8 years. i have taken classes in person and virtually. i love everything. the teachers are fantastic, proficient, and so good at what they do. i had a lower back compression years ago and started doing pilates as a “re-hab” and strengthening exercise regimen and it has been transformational. i am stronger, calmer, and more toned. i now take classes 6-7 days a week. i have met wonderful people in class, too!
– wendy l


doing pilates at the pilates movement has changed my life. it has helped me significantly with a longstanding hip injury and lower back pain. with the guidance of my instructor, i have become attuned to the workings of my body, developed a strong core and awareness of how to stand, walk, bend and move without pain. the one-on-one sessions have been invaluable to my progress and my sense of well-being. i am thrilled to have found the pilates movement!
– nancy t


i have been a client at the pilates movement since 2011-jen is an extremely well-organized business owner who has created an excellent studio experience as well as a strong online presence that was a lifeline for her clients during the pandemic. her talented instructors help motivate clients and are sensitive to individual needs.
– janet


the pilates movement is the best pilates studio on the upper east side. i started a few years ago with major low back problems. from private sessions to only 3 participants in each group class , the pilates movement studio works wonders and beyond. the atmosphere is relaxed, professional, respectful and customized once the instructor knows each participant. the instructors are all selected by the owner jennifer ruggiero who has high standards and takes great care to select instructors.
i could not function without going to the pilates movement. we are in awe of jennifer ruggiero who manages her business so well and still has time to give private classes. she is the best.
– brigitte g
