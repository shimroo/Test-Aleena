2024 native plants of the year



backyard perennial of the year (2024)great blue lobelialobelia siphiliticalobelia siphilitica, great blue lobelia, is the blue brother of remarkably red cardinal flower, l. cardinalis. they are both part of the very garden-worthy bellflower family, campanulaceae. in the wild, where it is thrilling to come upon, great blue lobelia is most often seen in part sun to part shade, near streams, sloughs, and other wetlands, telling you that in the garden it prefers moist soil. where content, it attains a height of two to three feet and colonizes through self-seeding. in most gardens, it persists for years. the summer flowers of great blue lobelia are various shades of violet-blue, lipped, lobed, and arranged on a long stalk. they are an important food source for several native bees, bumblebees, and hummingbirds. photo by mary free, master gardeners of northern virginiaread more



rare plant of the year (2024)pink lady’s slippercypripedium acauleseeing pink lady’s slipper on a walk in the woods, sometime in may, a plant lover’s endorphins really kick-in. the pink and tan flower has an unusual moccasin shape and dangles from a stem that rises from a pair of veined basal leaves. it has a unique design feature for pollination by bumblebees, which requires them to follow a one-way path through the flower, forcing insects to take a pre-determined route past its reproductive parts, sort like the way ikea makes you travel past all their sales displays before you get to the exit. cypripedium acaule is not common but can readily be seen at various places in new jersey, such as near ramapo lake in bergen county and at cheesequake park near the center of the state.read more
