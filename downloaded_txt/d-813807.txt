product review: trafficxcess





trafficxcess is a new site that says it guarantees more converting web visitors and online advertising with very little effort or cost.  so i decided to put it to the test...

my first impression was the site looks professional and clean, with an attractive look and feel.  it is easy to read and understand.  joining the site was easy and painless--they do offer 2 upgrade options but they are not required to gain the benefits.

the members area is very well laid out and intuitive--i could figure out what to do after only a few minutes and was able to get up and running in less than 5 minutes.  inside the site, you create links and ads--the links you simply enter any url links you use into the generator and it transforms them into "trafficxcess" links.  you create ads for anything you want to promote using the trafficxcess ad generator, which is very easy to use.  you can create as many links and as many ads as you like.  and they are organized in a logical way--links are displayed in the order you create them but also your 5 most recent links appear on the main page for quick reference.  also, since the link generator is the tool you'll use most, it is also right at the top of the main page when you login.  very smart!

after you've created at least 1 link and 1 ad you can start to generate traffic.  just use and promote the new trafficxcess link instead of the original source link you had.  every time the trafficxcess link is clicked, the page loads followed by a cool slide-up ad window at the bottom.  it displays an ad plus an image with your affiliate link that goes back to trafficxcess.  so if anyone clicks the trafficxcess image they see the site, and if they signup they become your referral.  it's a great viral feature because you can build referrals without even trying to just by using the site.

now every time the ad window displays (your trafficxcess links get clicked) you earn credits that get your ad displayed in the ad windows when other members' links get clicked.  so the more clicks, the more times your ads get displayed.

and this works virally--meaning as you make referrals into trafficxcess (either by promoting it or just using it and visitors click the trafficxcess image on the ad window to join) you also earn ad credits on their link clicks.  and this works up to 5 levels deep.  so you can create a massive amount of free ad views and web traffic by referring others to trafficxcess also.

i didn't get to test the full effect of a big downline yet (i just got the tool) but i can tell you the rest of the site works exactly as stated--my links got clicked, i earned credits, and my ads got displayed.  trafficxcess even tracked my results so i know how many clicks and how many ad displays.  that was an impressive unadvertised extra feature.

there is one more benefit and feature which might be the best of them all--downline emailing.  you can email your downline with offers, promotions, or whatever you like, and here is where trafficxcess really shines.  they took time to make the emailing often enough that it's valuable as a user, but no so often that it's a burden to your downline.  but the best part about this feature (and actually the credit earning too) is that it tells you exactly how long until you can mail again.  now that's cool.

overall i have to say i am impressed with trafficxcess.  it is simple yet powerful, and delivers on its promises.  highly recommended to anyone who wants to increase traffic and advertising.

5 campaign internet marketing tips





internet marketing is an important tool for any company that wants to be successful and prosperous. more and more websites and companies with websites realize the importance of driving traffic to their website.
internet marketing helps to drive this traffic. internet marketing can raise awareness, create brand recognition, and drive traffic to a website. the idea behind internet marketing is to catch the attention of consumers and possible customers as efficiently as possible. for many, campaign internet marketing is the only way to do so.

campaign marketing helps to hit your target audience in multiple ways. campaign marketing can be an incredible tool for some, but can be an issue and nuisance for others. these five tips will help you to get your internet marketing campaign off to the right start.

know your target
the most important thing for you to be able to do is to completely define and analyze your target market. if you are going to have an internet marketing campaign you need to make sure that you know exactly who you are trying to talk to. this information will help you to effectively reach your consumers, making your marketing efficient. 

be clear and concise
if you want to have a successful internet marketing campaign you need to be as clear and concise as possible. clearly state the message that you are trying to get to your target audience. muddled or confusing messages will render your internet marketing campaign useless and unsuccessful.

use multiple venues
there are multiple venues and mediums that you can use with internet marketing, including online advertising, email marketing, and search engine optimization. your campaign should include multiple venues and mediums, as you need to connect with your audience on as many levels as possible. 

work with professionals
if you are thinking about an internet marketing campaign you should consider hiring a professional internet marketing company. professionals are going to be able to provide you with the level of service that you need to have a clean, polished, and effective internet marketing endeavor. 

have patience
internet marketing is not going to be instant; it is going to need time to be successful. you need to be patient and wait for the results of your marketing to fully understand the success of the campaign. you will then be able to analyze your strategy to find weak points and strong points to work with for your next campaign. 
you need to make sure that you do your due diligence when attempting campaign internet marketing. if you fail to do your research, your campaign will fail to provide benefits to your company. you need to think about your target and think about how you are attempting to reach them. you also need to think about how you are going to go about your internet marketing tactics. companies that cover all of these bases before attempting to market over the internet will see the greatest benefits and the greatest success.

five top must dos for baby boomers starting their home business





don't quit your day job just yet.if you are a baby boomer looking to start a home business, there are 5 essentials things you must do first.

leaving the security of a job with an established 401(k) plan, health insurance or other benefits can create a real tug of war for baby boomers who want to pursue their dreams of owning their own business.


analyze your exit strategy

at the time of this writing, the youngest of the baby boomers are turning 42 and the oldest are turning 60.  no matter where you fall into this group, analyzing and preparing your exit strategy from your job will be crucial to your long-term success as a home business entrepreneur.  do you have adequate savings?  if you're married, will you be able to participate in your spouse's health insurance? 


create a financial plan

how much is your salary now? what are your fixed, variable and frivilous expenses?  creating a solid plan so that you and your family will know exactly what the financial picture will be until your business gets off the ground and starts generating revenue.


choosing a business model and legal entity

there are several business models to choose from; home party plans, consulting, and affiliate marketing to name a few.  you have to make the decision based on your personality and what you are best-suited for.  choosing a legal entity for your business should be discussed with a tax accountant or your attorney.  options are sole proprietor, llc or subchapter s- corp.


set business benchmarks

you wouldn't travel across the country without a road map, your business is the same.  setting financial and business-building benchmarks will help you to create a focused plan that will help you to reach your success.


get a physical

what does getting a physical have to do with your business?  once you leave your job, most likely your health insurance will change and as unfair as it may be, trying to get new health insurance when in your 40's, 50's or 60's can be difficult.  while pursuing your dreams of a home business is something you are probably very passionate about, if you do not have good health to enjoy the rewards of your efforts, then not much else is important.

the baby boomer generation is like no other before it or after it. technically, we are considered middle-aged, but we are anything but middle-aged in mind, body and spirit.  we know there is more meaning to life than a commute to an unrewarding 9-5 job, but there are also important steps we must take first.  planning and preparing for your home business now will lead to less headache's later on.

best businesses from home





in finding the best home based business for someone who dreams of being an entrepreneur, there is no hard and fast list of “bests.” one entrepreneur’s best home based business idea is another entrepreneur’s worst. so much depends on what that business owner-hopeful enjoys doing, knows how to do, and has some of the resources already in place for. other considerations in determining the best home based business are what the desired market will bear – what the competition is, and how saturated the market is.the best way for someone who wants a home based business to start is to determine what she or he loves – what she looks forward to doing, what makes the time fly by for him, what she would gladly spend many hours of every day accomplishing. the next step is for the owner-to-be to assess his or her training, skills and knowledge of various industries. putting the dream list with the skills list should indicate some crossover. those things that end up on both lists are great indicators of the best home based business type for this business owner to-be. if, for example, a veterinarian’s assistant is tired of making very little money working for someone else, braving the 30 minute crawl along the highway commute, but really loves those horses that her employer cares for. she might well be a great candidate for a riding school proprietorship, a horse farm, or a grooming facility.once the industry and anything more specific in the way of products or services has been determined for the best home based business idea, the work is not done. the business owner has to determine that the business will make money. questions the entrepreneur has to ask himself are “who will be my customers? why will they choose my service? how often will they need my services – what will make them repeat customers? who is the competition? how can i vary my services from the competition – i.e., what might be my niche? and, what should i charge for my services (based on what others are charging in the market area)?part of determining what to charge is determining expenses that must be paid to stay in business. once the entrepreneur determines the price that will be competitive she or he must find out if that asking price will bring in a profit. if the price that must be placed on the product to make a profit after expenses is too high to be competitive in the market the choices are to change the market or change the product. if it doesn’t make the company money, it’s not the best home based business.ps: this is the ultimate advice at the end of my articles: seeking residual income is the best way to start a work from home business.
