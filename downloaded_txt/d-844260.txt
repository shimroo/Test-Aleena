	 jessica alba
	 
    

as faithful as the sunrise, jessica alba is an inspiration to pregnant women everywhere. her determination to staying fit throughout her term just keeps getting more impressive. the "good luck chuck" babe was spotted yesterday as she exited emerson hall fitness in los angeles, california. looks like the paps have a new roosting post!

	 saoirse ronan
	 
    

her role in "atonement" earned saoirse ronan a golden globe nomination, but she hasn't read the ian mcewan novel the movie is based on. ronan is only 13, and the book deals with sexual themes. "atonement" is ronan's third film, but the irish actress is already getting attention for her role as the young briony tallis. in 2008, she is to appear with bill murray in the action-fantasy "city of ember" and star as a con artist in "death defying acts" alongside catherine zeta-jones. she also has the lead role in peter jackson film version of "the lovely bones" - another book she hasn't read because of its mature content.

	 vanessa anne hudgens
	 
    

john jeffrey martin and arielle jacobs play troy and gabriella with grace and expertise. martin looks nothing like zac efron, troy in the movie versions; he's a bit more macho. reilly said it took just about two songs for her to forget about zac. jacobs had the dark hair and perky cuteness that the movie's vanessa anne hudgens has, but she was no clone of the movie gabriella  she held her own. the plot's thin, the characters shallow, the moral  be who you want to be  way too obvious.

the fantasies and lies of jeanne carmen are an insult and an outrage to the memory of marilyn monroe. it should be obvious to anyone that jeanne was never in the same room with marilyn, never spoke to her, never set foot in her home.

	 tina majorino
	 
    

ellen page plays a quirky teenager in jason reitman's juno but she does so in a way i've rarely witnessed before. she's not rebelling from medication like natalie portman in garden state, nor is she just a normal, shy girl who is externally quirky like tina majorino in napoleon dynamite. her peculiarities aren't her definition like ally sheedy in the breakfast club, and she's not flippantly cute and brazenly poetic like zooey deschanel in paul gordon green's all the real girls. page's juno macguff certainly has hints of all these characters, but what we witness of her comes from somewhere far off-screen. remarkably, the world we're watching doesn't revolve around her.

the film features lynch's usual coterie of dyspeptic characters, with favourite old faces such as harry dean stanton and dern's mother diane ladd, and it is great to see a few performers who don't get the work they deserve, such as julia ormond and mary steenburgen. cameron daddo even gets a brief scene his finest work since models inc.
