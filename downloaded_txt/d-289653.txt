happy new year grammie!  that sounds like my mom's stew, but she makes it in a pot on top of the stove.  your way sounds easier, but she probably won't let me taste that either...

that's a great stew recipe!  i've been sick and looking for easy comfort food recipes and yours did the trick.  this is an awesome site. i found you by browsing on blog explosion. since you are really into food, i think you'll be interested in fohboh, http://www.fohboh.com/?i=28chblcn8r176, which is the international social network site for the restaurant industry and foodies everywhere. there's a vibrant wine community on the site with internationally known somelliers and reps from some of the worlds best vineyeards.    i think  you would definitely find value on the site you could incorporate into your blog.   cheers!

a fabulous apple cake!
i wanted to share this recipe with you for some time now, but couldn't find it.  this week  i discovered it  filed in with the salad recipes by mistake, and i'm really happy to have found it, because it is a family favorite and it wouldn't seem like fall without it.  this recipe yields  one of the most delicious apple cakes that i've ever tasted.  i don't remember how or when i acquired it, but i do know that it was a blue ribbon winner at a county fair in amish country. apple tubecake2 cups flour2 cups sugar plus 5 tsp. sugar for topping1 cup veg. oil4 eggs1/4 cup orange juice1 tbsp. baking powder2 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract5 sliced apples2 tsp. cinnamonin a large bowl, blend together well: flour, 2 cups sugar, oil, eggs, orange juice, baking powder, and vanilla.  (i do this in my kitchen aid to get it nice and smooth)in a separate bowl, mix apples, 5 tbsp. sugar and cinnamon.pour 1/2 of the batter into an ungreased tube pan, cover with half the apple mix and repeat layers once.bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes.let cake cool for about 1 hour before turning out onto a cake plate, sugar and apple side up.refrigerate leftovers.cake also freezes well.

it's the time of year to be overwhelmed with zucchini.  i can remember when you couldn't give the stuff away, but over the years, clever cooks started designing tasty recipes, and now zucchini has become very popular.  i love zucchini and so i thought i'd share a few of my favorite recipes with you.  i'll post one every couple of days.  this one comes from my sister-in-law, and is so good, that i could eat the whole thing by myself!  i hope you enjoy!zucchini pie3 cups grated or chopped zucchini, unpeeled1/2 cup chopped onions4 eggs, slightly beaten1/2 cup vegetable oil1/2 cup parmesan cheese6 oz. grated, sharp cheddar, divided  (save 1/4 cup for top)1 cup bisquick1/2 tsp. salt, pepper and parsleymix all ingredients in a large bowl. pour into a deep pie plate or large quiche dish.sprinkle reserved 1/4 cup of cheddar over top.bake at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes or until top is golden.nuke to reheat.  this tastes even better the next day!
