mohamed al mufti, "beirut," collage on canvas, 25x25cm, 2023 (courtesy of the artist).





tmr's editor in chief, jordan elgrably, asks four beirutis why they stay, and how they manage, enduring one crisis after another. as we were all watching the havoc and devastation being wreaked on gaza by israeli warplanes, tanks and troops, and wondering how palestinians would survive the onslaught to live another day, i asked myself how they managed to live through the conflagrations of 2009, 2014 and 2021. at the same time, a few hours to the north of gaza, the residents of beirut are hunkered down, observing the carnage and remembering everything they’ve lived through, including innumerable crises these past few years. continue reading



hope is our last resort: on mona simpson’s commitmentlos angeles review of books: jordan elgrably reviews the seventh novel from the author of anywhere but here. july 28, 2023















why do people los their minds, and where do they go when they’re no longer themselves? is mental illness curable? to the extent that a work of fiction can contend with the enormity of these questions, commitment, the seventh novel by mona simpson, does a masterful job of it. the story sets a family in motion over 400 pages, painting a portrait of a mother, her children, and their friends, in an attempt to get at the heart of what it’s like to have someone in your inner circle completely lose themselves to a mental breakdown.continue reading

the czech-french novelist died on july 11, 2023.many moons ago, when i was a young literary journalist living in paris, i happened to meet two american writers at the café flore. their names were william styron and james baldwin, and they were at the height of their fame, but baldwin nevertheless gave me the time of day, and i wound up interviewing him for the international herald tribune and then traveling down to baldwin’s home in saint paul de vence, where i interviewed him for a second time, for the paris review. july 12, 2023continue reading

nov. 15, 2022 | the markaz reviewjordan elgrably reads a book about white fear and racism and finds that colorism isn't our only problem.we’ve all imagined what it might be like  to experience an utterly different life, to be someone else — haven’t you ever wondered, for instance, what you would do if you won the lottery and became a millionaire overnight, or how you would deal with losing your home and becoming homeless — if you were to wake up one morning and you were dirt poor, so broke that you were no longer you? have you not imagined yourself so changed that others wouldn’t recognize you?continue reading












salman rushdie, sitting for an interview in new york.





“attack on salman rushdie is shocking tip of the iceberg”| aug. 15, 2022 | the markaz reviewan attack on one writer anywhere is an attack on freedom of expression everywhere.let us be brutally honest with ourselves — friday’s brazen attack on novelist salman rushdie is a threat to freedom of expression everywhere, but it is merely the latest incident in thousands of cases where writers, poets, journalists and filmmakers are censored, imprisoned and even killed. they are hounded as critical thinkers who dissent from the party line, blow the whistle on repressive governments, or because they dare to offend conservative sensibilities.continue reading

free speech, palestinian stories and the oscars | apr. 22, 2021 | the markaz review















despite the increasing diversification of the film industry in liberal hollywood, the odds are long against writer/director farah nabulsi’s the present winning the best short film oscar award on sunday. that’s not because her 24-minute story (now on netflix) doesn’t pack a powerful wallop, for viewers are confronted with the galling reality of israel’s military occupation of the west bank — we watch in anger and disappointment as a humiliated palestinian father takes his daughter shopping, and has to grovel his way through checkpoints manned by trigger-happy soldiers. starring the talented saleh bakri and child actor maryam kanj, the present deserves an oscar, but palestinians have received nods from the academy before and been snubbed on the big day.continue reading 















drought and the war in syria | jan. 15, 2021 | the markaz reviewwhen you live in southern california you become accustomed to, even blasé about catastrophe on a grand scale: wildfires, floods, riots, earthquakes and, often for long stretches, the drought. in a state where droughts have lasted for years, lifetime californians are occasionally visited by visions of the apocalypse—particularly during the most recent drought, a seven year chasm from 2011 to 2019. (you can imagine what would happen in a state where nearly 40 million people had to fight each other over water.) i confess that sci-fi movies in which the shortage of water is critical, like mad max, 72%, quantum of solace and the book of eli, affect me more profoundly than horror flicks. the fear of the tap running dry is akin to claustrophobia—running out of water is almost as bad as running out of air, after all. thus, during the latest drought, i was more than happy to economize my water usage, to the point of flushing every third go and sharing a bath with my wife and young son, depending on who decided to go first.continue reading















trump derangement syndrome, or how i learned to love america: on ayad akhtar’s “homeland elegies”  nov. 10, 2020 | la review of booksif you’ve already read camus’s the plague and have been searching for the perfect pre-apocalyptic fiction work to help you navigate our current affairs, this book may be just the provocation. i opened it knowing little about the author, other than having seen him act in the independent feature the war within and perused his play disgraced. neither had prepared me for homeland elegies, which turns out to be masterful storytelling for these disturbing times.just as a playwright may be tempted to break the fourth wall and talk directly to you in the audience, a novelist wants you to believe that the tales s/he’s weaving are the honest-to-god’s truth — and maybe they are, even if they’re woven whole cloth, because as the ancient greeks like to shout back at socrates, “what is truth?” thespians are first about the performance, always, but one hopes to glean nuggets of vérité, and in this first-person confession about a prize-winning playwright and sometime-actor named ayad akhtar, it’s the performance that counts.continue reading















a beheading for the prophet and a reckoning for france | oct. 26, 2020 | the markaz reviewfrance and its muslims are at loggerheads over the horrific beheading of schoolteacher samuel paty and the national response, which has put islam on alert.on october 16 paty was cornered outside his school in conflans, a paris suburb. he was beheaded by an 18-year-old chechen muslim who was heeding a fatwa that condemned paty for displaying satirical cartoons of the prophet in a class discussing freedom of expression.a few days later, two women in hijab near the eiffel tower were reportedly stabbed by two french women shouting epithets including “dirty arabs.”continue reading

america has never been more heartbreaking than when it is at war with itself, divided down lines of color, of so-called “race”—the illusion that color or ethnicity really makes us different, whether black, white, arab, jew, this, that, “us and them.” dna tests prove beyond a doubt that we are all more interconnected than anyone could ever guess, so that these seeming divisions can only be perpetuated by fear and stereotypes—indeed, by ignorance. read more.
