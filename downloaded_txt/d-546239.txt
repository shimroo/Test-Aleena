what professionals should recognise as the social impact of adhd. retired police officer phil anderton brings us a unique book looking at how young people with poorly managed adhd are at risk of following a path into crime, substance misuse, anti-social behaviour and personal danger, and outlines ways to reduce those risks with easy to follow and pragmatic text and checklists. the book, the first of its kind also has advice for  magistrates and the police when coming into contact with these young people.

you can buy it online now. just click here  "as an adult who has adhd, from childhood, and i have had my fair share of issues with the police and courts as a consequence, i really appreciate the interest in this subject being taken by phil anderton. this book should be read by anyone and everyone who deals with youngsters who have the disorder, if the people who looked after me had recognised my tipping points and done right by me, i might not have the criminal record that i have."  gary sendall, founder waddsupp, adult adhd support group in the wirrall "many books seek to promote awareness of adhd among the public but very few do so with as splendid a combination of science and compassion as does mr. anderton in this up-to-the-minute summation of what parents and others should know about adhd and its management." professor russell barkley, suny upstate medical school "this book is very welcome â it takes the lessons from the scientific study of adhd and applies them to a social and justice perspective.  it deserves to be read widely, especially by those who doubt whether the individualâs vulnerability of adhd is relevant to how society should react." professor eric taylor, king's college london, institute of psychiatry, london "phil anderton, an experienced police officer, has seen that many who get in trouble with the law have adhd. in this book he clearly describes what adhd is and makes very practical suggestions for how those with adhd can be powerfully helped by appropriate treatment. his approach is sensible, compassionate, and desperately needed."
