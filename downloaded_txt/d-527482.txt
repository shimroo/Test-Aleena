tamograph® site survey

                            make smarter decisions based on precise coverage and performance data.

                            if your job involves wi-fi network deployment and maintenance,
                            you know that radio wave propagation is difficult to predict.

                            it is virtually impossible to consider all the variables that might
                            affect the health and performance of your wlan.

                            and that’s where tamograph site survey comes to the rescue.
