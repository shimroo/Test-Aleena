we have been advancing fertility care for over 30 years at guy’s assisted conception unit. our fertility specialists are internationally recognised as pioneers and treat over 2,000 patients each year.
our private fertility care includes:

ivf, icsi and iui
pre-implantation genetic testing (pgt) 
egg, embryo and sperm freezing and storage
fertility counselling

our fertility specialists only use precise, evidence-based approaches to best support your care. we never recommend fertility treatment ‘add-ons’ as they are not proven to be effective.
we are proud to have received a rating of 5/5  from our patients and the human fertilisation and embryology authority (hfea), the uk’s fertility regulator.




 








fertility care for everyone

we welcome anyone that wishes to explore fertility care. in addition to heterosexual couples, our specialists regularly treat same-sex couples as well as individuals seeking to use donor sperm or eggs to conceive.
our consultants are also experts in the care of transgender patients as well as fertility preservation options for cancer patients and those looking to delay parenthood.

advanced fertility investigations
as many as 1 in 6 heterosexual couples experience fertility problems. this can increase to 1 in 4 if the attempt to conceive starts at the age of 40. the most common cause is male-factor infertility – issues with sperm quality, quantity or mobility. however, for 1 in 3 couples experiencing fertility issues, a cause cannot be identified.
we provide a comprehensive range of fertility tests and scans to help us understand your fertility potential. this helps us determine the best treatment option, whether that be ivf, icsi, or donor treatments and surrogacy.
in most cases, on our personalised care pathway, you can commence treatment on your next cycle.













innovative assisted conception techniques

our specialists lead the way in enhanced techniques for assisted conception.
for example, we use embryoscope™ technology to produce time-lapse videos of embryos during early stages of development. this helps us select embryos with the greatest chance of implantation to establish pregnancy. it also helps maintain a stable environment for developing embryos as we don’t have to open the incubator to conduct the analysis.
in addition, we use radio frequency identification tags to lock egg and sperm samples to the identity of each patient. this safeguards each step of the assisted conception process.

fertility counselling
every fertility journey is different, and we know that patients can experience emotional challenges that take a toll on their health and wellbeing. that’s why we include up to 6 fertility counselling sessions as part of our treatment packages for anyone that may benefit.
our fertility counsellors have a wealth of expertise with patients undergoing fertility treatments and can provide emotional and psychosexual support throughout your treatment journey.













pre-implantation genetic testing (pgt)

our pgt service is available to anyone at risk of having a child with a chromosomal or inherited (genetic) disorder. we test for over 300 genetic conditions at our state-of-the-art facilities, including cystic fibrosis, huntington’s disease and sickle cell disease.
we have the largest pgt service in the uk and perform over 50% of all pgt cycles in the country. we are proud that our centre is the most successful in europe with over 1,000 babies being born following pgt at guy’s hospital.
we only offer evidence-based pgt-m and pgt-sr methods of preimplantation genetic testing. we do not offer pgt-a as there is not sufficient evidence of its benefits in improving the chances of conception.

fertility preservation for delayed parenthood
there are many reasons why you may wish to explore storing your eggs, sperm or embryos. for example, certain medical treatments may affect your reproductive organs, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer.
fertility preservation may also be explored if you are just not ready to have children yet but may in future. our specialists can explore a range of options, based on your age, health history and lifestyle choices to help make a decision that is right for you.












donors and surrogates
our comprehensive donor and surrogacy service can support you in your journey to parenthood. we work with external partner organisations that source and transport sperm and egg donations as well as match surrogates to families. we can support with fertility care for any option selected.













fertility information evenings

our patient information evenings are a great way for you to find out more about our assisted conception unit and why we are the leading provider of fertility services in the uk.
each of our evenings has a panel of experts, including a member of our clinical team (such as one of our nurses, doctors or consultants), an embryologist, and our quality and administrative team members.
whether you are just starting your fertility journey and want to learn more or have had fertility treatment before, our virtual events are an opportunity to hear from our world-renowned fertility team and ask them questions.

transparent pricing with no hidden fees

we will only recommend treatments that are evidence based, meaning you won’t have any unnecessary add-ons or hidden fees.
