jeremy kahler and his team were amazing to work with!  we hired jeremy to sell our house, and the communication was top notch throughout the entire process.  this was our first time using a real estate team, rather than just an individual agent, and it really is a good way to sell a house.  everybody has their specific set of responsibilities, and things move quickly because of that.  we had a slight glitch in the paperwork at one point, but it was quickly remedied, and everything moved smoothly after that.  we would highly recommend jeremy and his team if you're looking for a nice down home feeling transaction.  even though they are professionals, it felt like working with friends!
