hot air balloons can only fly in stable air and no rain (including foreseeable rain). during the day, the sun heats the earth, which creates thermals making it unstable for balloons to fly. where do the balloons fly in the morning? balloons will follow the direction of the wind and for the tigard festival of balloons that wind needs to be blowing generally south to avoid populated areas to the north. look for the balloons over tigard, tualatin, sherwood, wilsonville, aurora or woodburn.
