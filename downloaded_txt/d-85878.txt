 why should you  train your dog? 
 if you think about you send your child to school – why not send your dog to school and lay the groundwork early? we recommend starting puppies in training between  3 1/2 to 4 months  of age. 
 however, it's never too late to start training.

what our clients  are saying
 " 
friendly, professional, effective. in two weeks my energetic little pitbull went from not listening  to anything to obeying commands quickly. the little training session at pick-up was especially  helpful to ensure we're doing the right things to reinforce the training.  it was tough letting our girl go for two weeks but it was well worth it.  i would recommend dan and his team to anyone looking to get their dog trained.
