starcodes
navigate your chart with choice based astrology

reading an astrology chart is based on the concept that what we see above maps what happens below; we notice a relationship between the dance of the planets around our sun and the energies we feel here on earth. this book takes you a journey though this epic cosmic map, exploring the multidimensional archetypes and mythologies that resonate deep in our souls.
