when homeland security needed help keeping america safe, they chose us. 
september 11th changed the way we travel. when looking for a partner that knew security and could help keep airlines and, therefore, americans safe, homeland security chose us. with the help of our strategic hardware partner, lockheed martin, we developed, implemented, and managed the tsa pre-check program for the first 10+ years of its existence.

intelligence services
let’s face it, our government is too big and too slow to keep its citizens informed in a timely manner. whether it be september 11th or the most recent coronavirus, our clients have learned they cannot afford to depend on the government to keep them up to date and ahead of life altering realties.  for more than 30 years, we have worked with and employed the professionals from the fbi, cia, nsa, and dea.  at aset, we leverage these relationships in order to keep our clients informed and to protect them from being caught off guard.
