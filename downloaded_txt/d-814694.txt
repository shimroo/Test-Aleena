frequently asked questions about awnings & canopies
what are the benefits of using awnings on a patio or deck?

how do outdoor canopies differ from traditional awnings?
outdoor canopies can be freestanding structures, often supported by a metal frame, providing coverage over larger areas such as lawns, patios, or gardens.they are versatile and can be used as outdoor classrooms or event pavilions.traditional awnings are typically attached to a building, providing shade for windows, doors, or patios. both offer protection from the sun and rain but differ in installation and design.
what materials are commonly used for awning construction?
awnings are typically constructed from materials like canvas, vinyl, acrylic fabrics, and metals such as aluminum and stainless steel. the frames are often made from aluminum or steel, with powder coating for added rust and corrosion resistance. fabric options include durable, weather-resistant materials that provide uv protection and are available in various colors and patterns.
how do you maintain and clean awnings to ensure longevity?
regular maintenance and cleaning are essential for the longevity of awnings. use a soft brush to remove dirt and debris, and wash the fabric with mild dish soap and water. avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the material. inspect the frame for rust or corrosion and apply a protective coating if necessary.
