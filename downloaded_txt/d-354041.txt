the official phillip margolin site
welcome to the website! i hope both new and old fans will enjoy learning more about my books and talking to me about writing, reading and the world of phillip margolin. i’ve always thought of myself as a fan more than a writer.
i’ve been an avid reader since elementary school and have a book with me wherever i go. i was in my 30’s before i published my first story, and 34 when my first novel, heartstone, was published. one of the most exciting aspects of being a published novelist is that i get to meet other writers whose books i have enjoyed.
i’m excited to communicate with more of my readers through this site. as a self-taught writer, i enjoy answering questions because i would have loved to ask somebody about writing when i was starting out.
