about
the black church
the black church is truly the heart of the african-american community. in fact, 
you may say that it is the community. throughout all of our struggles in american 
history, the black church has been a constant in our evolution. it fed our hope 
during slavery and was our meeting place during the civil rights movement. through 
bombings and burnings, it stands strong, "steadfast and unmoveable." 
with the good news of jesus christ, it is a beacon of light that shines on all 
those who are broken, weary, and downtrodden.  it serves as the center of 
the african-american community's spiritual growth and time will prove that the 
black church will be the center of the african-american community's economic growth 
as well. there is no greater or more powerful institution that exists today for 
any group of people than that of the black church.
