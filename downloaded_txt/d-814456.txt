recognition of indigenous land






members of the missoula organization of realtors® recognize and acknowledge that the lands of which we focus our business was once the territory of the blackfoot confederacy (siksikaitsitapi), salish (selis), kootenai (ksanka), and kalispel (qlispe) where they would hunt, gather, raise their family, hold ceremonies and protect the land which now represents our homes, our agriculture and our way of life. we honor and recognize the connections of salish (selis), kootenai (ksanka), kalispel (qlispe) people, the blackfoot confederacy (siksikaitsitapi), and all people who have migrated through. 
we are committed to care for the land with honor and grace as the people before us did.
