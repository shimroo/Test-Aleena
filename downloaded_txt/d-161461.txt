switzerland's history

  switzerland is a small country situated in the heart of central europe
  and shares a lot of it's history and of it's culture
  (four national languages spoken in different regions) with it's
  neighbours germany, france, italy and austria.
  

  when does the history of switzerland begin? the answer depends on
  the interpretation of the term switzerland: 
archeology shows that stone age hunters
   have been living in switzerland already before the last ice age
   (approximately 350'000 b.c.).
switzerland's official latin name 
   "confoederatio helvetica" 
   goes back to a celtic tribe called 
   the helvetians.
the majority of switzerland's "native"
   population
   settled during the germanic migration of nations that set
   an end to the roman empire in western europe at about 400 a.d.
the old swiss confederacy
   was founded in the first days of august, 1291 
   (hence switzerland's national holiday is celebrated on
   august, 1st).
switzerland was officially accepted as an independent nation
   by its neighbours in the 1648 european peace treaty.
   
the swiss revolution and the helvetic republic
   have set an end to the rule of a small number of privileged cities,
   valleys and families over the majority of the country.
today's borders and 
   switzerland's neutrality
   were defined at the vienna congress of 1815 ending
   the wars of napoleon.
switzerland's modern federal constitution
   dates back to 1848 (with total revisions in 1874 and 1999).


  there might be good reasons for any of these choices because 
  switzerland has been changing a lot during the centuries of its
  history and there is not really too much common ground between
  the helvetians or the medieval old swiss confederacy
  and the modern swiss civil society.
  

  nevertheless this website starts with the first inhabitants we have
  any accounts of, but it does focus on switzerland's change into a
  modern democratic society and on
  switzerland's role in world war ii.

  the counts of habsburg and fight for autonomy. cities join the
  confederacy. they conquer territories in northern and southern
  switzerland.
 
1523 - 1536reformation
swiss reformers zwingli and calvin even more radical
  than luther in germany. calvin's doctrine has influenced denominations
  in many other countries. 
 
1536 - 1798ancien regime
switzerland is a loose confederacy of 13 cities and
  small valley communities dominating the rest of the country. a few
  families control state affairs. several rebellions put down by
  military force: repressed aspects of history in a country so proud
  of it's tradition of democracy.
 
1798 - 1802helvetic republic
revolution in switzerland. farmers in occupied
  territories become free citizens. centralistic parliamentary
  republic according to french model. occupation by french troops and
  some battles of napoleon vs. austria and russia in switzerland.

  emperor napoleon enforces a constitution negociated under his
  "mediation"

confederacy reestablished, however with 22 cantons
  [member states]. liberals in minority position.
 
1830 - 1848regeneration
second french revolution (1830) also boosts liberals in
  switzerland. some federal states with liberal governments and
  new constitutions. the conservative catholic governments of some
  cantons [federal states] set up a secret special alliance
  ["sonderbund"] against the liberal governments of other
  cantons. this leads to a short civil war 
  ["sonderbundskrieg"] (1847).
 
1848federal state
new federal constitution combining elements of
  the u.s. constitution (federal state with central and cantonal
  [state] governments and parliaments) and of french revolutionary

  economic crisis hit this industrialized country severely.  
 
1933 - 1939spiritual defense
hitler in germany is soon seen as a danger to 
  switzerland's independence. thousands of german refugees (jews,

  with liberal employers against fascist threat.
 
1939 - 1945world war ii.
neutral switzerland surrounded by fascist troops
  (germany, austria, italy) or collaborating regimes (vichy-france).
  some trade with hitler was inevitable for sheer survival (and the
  survival of more than 150,000 refugees). other, not inevitable
  aspects were: (too) rigid refugee politics (25,000 sent back),
  uncritical collaboration in case of looted assets and accepting
  stolen gold.
 
since 1945prosperity
recent history is characterized by political 
  stability, economic progress, increased social security and a new
  openness and tolerance.
