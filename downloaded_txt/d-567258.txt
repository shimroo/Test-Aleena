"andrew at fastframe york helped me choose the best mount and frame for my award certificate. the result was brilliant and shows off my achievement. much better than going to one of the discount shops and it falling to bits when you hang it! one thing i liked was the personal service and i found the experience easy and ended up with a quality product. i would recommend fastframe york to anyone who needs a quality job done at a reasonable price."grahame – pocklington
