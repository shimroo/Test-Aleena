wicker microtargetting good sign for musgrove- here's why.





madison, ms-- cudos to john leek for the revelation of these calls.  his idea that microtargetting will be good for the gop in the future is true.  however, it does wicker no good now, and actually hurts him.  wicker doesn't have time to be microtargetting at this point.  he should have done that months ago.  the only thing wicker needs to be focusing on is pumping up his name i.d. and likeability.  any money spent microtargetting is money he should be spending on name i.d.  musgrove will ride two large tides:1. obama in the delta and jackson. 2. childers in north mississippi. should be within a couple thousand votes.

will wicker explain allegations ?





madison, ms-- members of the catfish nation want to know what "ethical misconduct" musgrove participated in.i love a great bare knuckled political brawl--been in several myself.  however, when folks start going personal and claim they are "not-uh - familiar with - uh - that part of the commercial", then i am going to call it how i see it.  hopefully- by monday- we'll figure this one out.  too bad bardwell is off the web.  i bet his post on this topic would be hilarious.

ethical misconduct ?





madison, ms-- will democrats ask wicker what ad was talking about?will cottonmouth ask what the ad was about ?this particular ad says musgrove committed "ethical misconduct".when asked about musgrove's supposed "ethical misconduct", wicker said the following:"i - i - i - i  don't think that - i'm - i'm -i'm not sure- that uh- that- that i'm-uh- familiar with that part of the commercial. political ads can cost a small fortune.  i read every script of every ad of the last campaign i worked on.  our ads were the most successful in mississippi history so i can speak with great detail about this subject.  i am curious about this.  if you are a candidate for united states senate and you make a charge like that against a former governor, wouldn't you know what the charge was?wouldn't you ? i would, and i'm gonna find out what the "ethical misconduct" was that wicker's ad was talking about.

hoover sauce





madison, ms--have you ever heard of it?  well we have, and you need to get some too.  if you live near the metro jackson area, you can stop by jimmy's prime meats in ridgeland off hwy 51 across the street from mcdonalds.  this sauce is a honey brown mixture of soy, garlic, various spices, and a secret sweetener.  this sauce is legendary and you should google "hoover sauce" to read more.  leave page and google now.

like the movements of a mississippi blue gilled catfish, tcr returns to slow, but efficient posting





madison, ms-- tcr has been enjoying the madison pad and is currently about to smoke four cornish game hens on the egg.  no frills.  just olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. sometimes chicken tastes close to perfect with these four ingredients are used together.
