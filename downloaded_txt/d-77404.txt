mayor’s message
it is my honor and privilege to serve newport as mayor.




we all want newport to be safe and healthy and have a welcoming atmosphere where people choose to live. i am committed to leading us in that endeavor. together, with my fellow council members and city staff, we have an amazing opportunity to have a hand in newport’s evolution from a drive-through city to a “drive-to” city.
a trusted, effective, and relevant government is built on strong relationships. to accomplish our vision of creating a center of opportunity where families and businesses thrive, we must create a city where everyone has a safe place to call home. our goal is to ensure that all residents experience this every time they interact with a city employee. we welcome all to come to our great city – welcome to newport.
