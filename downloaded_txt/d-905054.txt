custom scrimshaw by mark thogerson





welcome to the web home of scrimshaw by mark thogerson. i am a scrimshander with over 50 years of experience working with ivory and antler.  i only use natural materials – fossil mammoth and walrus ivories, old ivory piano keys, and shed antlers – and work them using hand tools and materials similar to those the whalers may have had in the 19th century.  the result is an authentic look, and pieces you will be proud to display or use.
please browse my online catalog to view scrimshaw for sale, and take a peek at my art fair schedule to see if i will be exhibiting near you. if you have questions about scrimshaw, ivory and its care, or the laws regarding its sale, please review my faqs page. those interested in commissioning a piece will want to review items in the scrimshaw gallery, and some ofmy recent commissions. 
i do not do appraisals.
















in addition to scrimshaw, i accept commissionsfor custom-made wooden liturgical items such asprocessional and altar crosses, candlesticks,pectoral crosses and other items.
please email me for details.
