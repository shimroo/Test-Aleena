“i love this place. in the several months i have been taking lessons there they have given me the opportunity to bring to light my life long dream of learning to dance. the staff, instructors and all the leads and follows are wonderful!”

- dave v.





"more than just a dance studio, mayi spurs personal growth through dance. my life is so much richer thanks to mayi."

- wayne j.





"learning to partner dance at mihtd was a life-changing experience for me. i walked in alone on my first day feeling scared and vulnerable, but that changed almost immediately. nino and his staff create a safe and authentic atmosphere. they care about your well being and stress having fun over anything else. may i is truly special."

- diane p.
