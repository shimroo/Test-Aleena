"building trusted relationships, through the development of quality neighborhoods"




























































who we are...
founded in 1988 by roger and tim schultz, schultz construction was primarily focused on the residential market; however, our manhattan community began to see growth in the early 90’s and we took advantage of new opportunities expanding the company’s resume to include commercial and government related projects.  now owned by brett ballou and taylor kuhn, schultz construction has successful projects in riley, geary, pottawatomie, clay, cloud, morris, marshall, dickinson, wabaunsee and shawnee counties.  

our mission statement is “building trusted relationships through the development of quality neighborhoods.”  that trust is earned with clients, design professionals and tradesmen through strong leadership, a serving attitude and commitment to our word.  whether it be a medical office building, apartment complex, manufacturing center or custom home, schultz construction provides quality in all facets of construction from design to the project completion.
