stock #5 pto chipper
notesget the job done and into the truck quickly and easily with the sc5540b! heavy-duty construction, the sc5540b pto 3-point hitch chipper/shredder weighs 720 pounds – this means years of dependable service. the double-banded belt drive gives a more positive transfer of power. 

a great machine to move from job to job, the sc5540b is the machine landscapers and golf courses trust to clean up, move debris and make mulch. a manual-feed chipper/shredder without a screen reduces plugging, especially with damp material. the 20.6? x 0.75? thick, 145-pound dynamically-balanced rotor is equipped with 4 reversible chipper blades and 36 shredder knives. 

note – for use on tractors with pto horsepower ratings from 25 hp to 45 hp
