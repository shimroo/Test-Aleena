are you the victim of a tractor trailer crash?talk to us 24/7semi truck & tractor trailer crash / accident attorney1 out of every 8 people killed in a traffic accident in the united states is killed in an accident involving a tractor trailer / semi truck. every year, 500,000 large trucks, or "semis," are involved in accidents on our roads. of these, 5,000 involve fatalities and over 94,000 crashes resulting in injury. in crashes between passenger vehicles and large semi truck, the ration of occupant fatalities is about 21 to 1.
truck drivers repeatedly break federal laws by driving:

while fatigued
in excess of the amount of hours they are allowed to drive
with oversized trucks
with overloaded trucks
with improper maintenance
with an inability to see at night

there are several reasons why semi truck accidents are so dangerous: size, speed and driver fatigue. a fully loaded, over-the-road semi truck is a huge piece of machinery. when you put something like that on the road at speeds topping 60 miles an hour you get a monster that can run over anything in its path. tractor trailer / truck drivers are under constant pressure to move cargo and then, add the growing problem of truck driver fatigue. often semi truck drivers have 16-hour days which are not uncommon.
to pursue a large semi truck case, performing an accurate accident reconstruction and obtaining documentary evidence from the trucking company to support the case is crucial. we can try and assist you with any and all litigation you wish to pursue if you or anyone you know has been the victim of a tractor trailer / semi truck accident contact us today.
