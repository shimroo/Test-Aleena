light a virtual candle
an integral part of our orthodox worship is lighting a candle as we enter the church. prayers are important especially during this difficult time. our church doors are now open in limited capacity (see above). if you're not able to attend quite yet, you can still have candles lit and prayers said for you and your loved ones. please submit your request on the form below, click on a donation amount, and fr. photios will light candles and say prayers for you and your loved ones at the next scheduled service.

the mission of our web site is to provide an instant and accessible forum of information about our parish, its families, our culture and our faith, orthodox christianity. it is intended to be educational, informative and spiritual, with the ultimate goal being the spreading of his word.
we welcome all resident and non-resident orthodox and non-orthodox faithful to our church and invite you to join us for altar services, educational programs and events.
