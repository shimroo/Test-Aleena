sec fans unite





for diehard football fans, today is one of the best days of the year because the bcs national championship game is finally here! i wouldn't classify myself as a diehard fan, but i do enjoy a quality football game, which is exactly what i expect tonight's game to be. although i would love to say i am rooting for the florida gators during the bcs championship game, anyone that hasn't been living under a rock the past month knows they aren't playing tonight. so as a gators fan, who am i hoping walks away the national champion? well, that's easy...  

okay, it's really not that easy. both teams have top-notch defenses that have been talked about all season. despite the great defenses, i believe alabama has the better offense. given the offensive advantage and the fact that they are a fellow sec team, i will be cheering for the university of alabama tonight.

i got myself the alabama t-shirt below for tonight's game too! i ordered it from crimson tide planet -- check out my shopping for sec merchandise? your team has a planet. blog post if you don't know about crimson tide planet.







so what do you guys think? will alabama be back-to-back national champions or will notre dame be national champions for the first time since 1988?

off to the sugar bowl 











 (photo credit: wikipedia)

the bowl gods have spoken and no. 3 florida will play no. 21
louisville in the sugar bowl on january 2, 2013. kickoff for the sugar bowl is
at 8:30 at the superdome in new orleans! florida will be playing in the sugar
bowl for the ninth time while louisville will be making its first appearance.





in my biased opinion, this will be an easy game for florida,
but here are three reasons why the sugar bowl will still be worth watching:


louisville head coach charlie strong previous coaching resume includes multiple positions at the university of florida.
rumors are flying about charlie strong leaving louisville for other schools so there is a chance he won't even be coaching louisville in the sugar bowl. 
florida juniors matt elam, dominique easley, sharrif floyd and jordan reed may be playing their last game as florida gators since they are all eligible to enter the nfl draft.



bottom line, this game will be drama filled even if it isn’t
a close game!

shopping for sec merchandise? your team has a planet.





yes, there are eight million places to buy your favorite college football gear these days, but sometimes you just want to feel at home. i was actually trying to find some florida baby gear for a new addition to the family recently and stumbled upon a pretty cool series of stores - my team planet.

from what i learned these guys have been slowly adding stores across all of the major conferences and have a pretty huge selection of gear for all of your favorite sec teams as well as some of those other conferences that sometimes have good basketball teams...

pricing and selection seems pretty good, so if you've got a rooting interest in one of the mighty sec teams, or if you're just buying gear for a fan who has the good taste to cheer for a team in the best conference in all of college sports i recommend you check them out. here's a few links to the sec stores, you can figure out how to find the other stores if you're one of those types that think ohio state or texas are football schools. ;)

here ya go!

wildcat planet
and most importantly - gators planet
