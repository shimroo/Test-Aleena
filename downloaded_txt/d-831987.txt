worlds best riding bmx cruzers!
firemans celebrated our 25 year anniversary in 2023 – thanks to all our loyal customers for all their support over all those years!
firemans 26″ bmx framesets have been handmade in usa since 1998. our cruzers have an old school, laid back geometry with perfect balance, fit, feel, and steering unlike any others made today or in the modern era. since day 1, our cruzers have all cruzed like a cruzer is supposed to cruze!

photos from receiving day apr 7, 2023 – this was a historic day in fm history for us – getting frames back in after the pandemic while also celebrating our 25 year anniversary – we appreciate the incredible response! we have a few framesets left from this batch, so get ’em while you can! see framesets or store page for colors left. we expect our next delivery within the next few months which will include some old favorites, some unique variations, lots of killer colors, and some new surprises as well – so stay tuned! feel free to email us with questions or to get on the waitlist.
