how to spot a dangerous tree: warning signs you should never ignore 
by secure_admin  |  feb 12, 2025  |  tree service 
trees add beauty, shade, and value to your property, but sometimes they can become a hazard. a weakened or dying tree can fall unexpectedly, damaging homes, vehicles, or even injuring people. that’s why it’s crucial to recognize the warning signs of a dangerous tree before it’s too late.  

signs of a dangerous tree 
if you’re unsure whether a tree in your yard poses a risk, here are some key signs to watch for. once you see these signs, don’t hesitate to hire a tree removal atlanta company.  
1. cracks or splits in the trunk 
a healthy tree should have a solid, intact trunk. if you notice deep cracks, splits, or missing bark, it could indicate structural weakness. large cracks may mean the tree is at risk of breaking apart, especially during storms or high winds. 
if the trunk has a hollow section, that’s another red flag. while some trees can survive with a hollow trunk, too much decay can weaken the tree’s support and make it more likely to fall. 
2. dead or hanging branches 
dead branches are one of the most obvious signs of a struggling tree. if you see large branches that are dry, brittle, or missing bark, they could fall at any moment. even worse, if those branches are hanging over your home, driveway, or walkways, they pose a serious danger. 
regularly inspect your tree for dead branches, especially after storms.  
3. leaning tree 
a tree that suddenly starts leaning is a major warning sign. while some trees naturally grow at an angle, a noticeable shift in position could mean that the roots are losing their grip on the soil. this is especially concerning if the lean is accompanied by cracks in the ground around the base. 
if a tree is leaning more than usual, avoid standing or parking under it. it may need to be stabilized or removed to prevent an unexpected fall. 
4. fungal growth or rot 
fungus growing at the base of a tree is often a sign of internal decay. mushrooms, shelf fungi, or other growths on the trunk or roots suggest that the tree may be rotting from the inside. this can weaken its structure, making it more prone to falling. 
decay isn’t always visible, but other signs—like soft or spongy wood, oozing sap, or a foul smell—can indicate trouble.  
5. uprooted or damaged roots 
tree roots anchor the tree and provide essential nutrients. if you see exposed, broken, or rotting roots, the tree’s stability may be compromised. construction work, soil erosion, or fungal infections can all damage roots and weaken the tree over time. 
conclusion: signs of a dangerous tree 
spotting a dangerous tree early can save you from costly damage and potential injuries. deep cracks, dead branches, sudden leaning, fungal growth, and root damage are all serious warning signs that shouldn’t be ignored. if you notice any of these issues, don’t wait until it’s too late—consult a professional arborist to assess the tree’s condition. taking action now can help keep your property and loved ones safe from unexpected tree hazards. 

 

things to do during a power outage 
by secure_admin  |  dec 27, 2024  |  electrical services 
power outages can happen unexpectedly, leaving you without electricity for hours or even days. while it’s easy to feel frustrated or helpless, there are plenty of things you can do to make the situation more manageable and even productive. staying calm and having a plan will help you navigate the disruption smoothly. 

tips to follow during a power outage 
here are some helpful tips from a professional atlanta electrician for what to do during a power outage. 
1. stay safe and check for hazards 
the first thing you should do during a power outage is ensure your safety. if you’re at home, check for any immediate hazards, like exposed wires or electrical smells. it’s important to turn off all electrical appliances, especially sensitive ones like computers, tvs, and stoves, to avoid damage when the power returns. if you have candles or oil lamps, use them carefully to prevent fires, and never leave them unattended. additionally, check on any household members, especially those who are elderly or have medical conditions, to make sure they’re comfortable and safe during the outage. 
2. use alternative light sources 
since you won’t have access to electric lighting during a power outage, make sure you have reliable alternative light sources on hand. flashlights, battery-operated lanterns, or glow sticks are great options. if you’re running low on batteries, be resourceful—use the flashlight on your phone, though conserve battery life as much as possible. if it’s daylight, open your blinds or curtains to let natural light in. keeping a backup power supply, like a portable battery charger, will ensure you’re never left in the dark, literally or figuratively. 
3. keep food and water safe 
if the power outage lasts for a few hours, your food may be safe, but anything longer could put your perishable items at risk. keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed to preserve the cold temperature. a full freezer can stay cold for up to 48 hours, while a half-full freezer will maintain its temperature for about 24 hours. if you have access to ice, use it to keep perishables cool. if you’re unsure about food safety after the power has been out for more than a few hours, it’s better to err on the side of caution and throw away any questionable items. 
4. stay informed 
in today’s world, staying informed during a power outage is crucial. if you don’t have electricity, your phone’s battery could be your lifeline to news and updates. be sure to keep your phone charged, especially if you rely on it for communication. if the power is out in your area due to a storm, local authorities or power companies may provide updates on the estimated time of restoration. you can also use a battery-operated radio to listen to emergency broadcasts. staying informed allows you to plan accordingly, whether you need to prepare for a longer outage or make other arrangements. 
5. engage in activities to pass the time 
if the power outage is extended, you’ll need to keep yourself and your family entertained. this is the perfect opportunity to engage in activities that don’t require electricity. if you have children, consider playing board games, cards, or telling stories. if you’re alone, pick up a book or try a craft that doesn’t need power. you can also take advantage of the time to relax and disconnect—sometimes, a break from screens is a welcome respite.  
conclusion: tips to follow during a power outage 
power outages are an unfortunate but inevitable part of life. the key to managing them is staying calm, safe, and proactive. engaging in non-electrical activities can keep spirits high, and preparing for future outages ensures you’re ready when they happen. next time the lights go out, you’ll be equipped to handle the situation with confidence and ease.
