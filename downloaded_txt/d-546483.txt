the food decision-making program's vision is health and well-being for all where children and their families are:

supported by sustainable, just, and equitable community food systems
developing healthy attitudes toward food and eating
making thoughtful food decisions
bringing their behaviors in alignment with their understandings, goals and current scientific knowledge
engaging in community improvement

our current initiatives are focused on increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables through improving their availability, accessibility, and appreciation by children and their families.  we are also interested in fostering partnerships among various stakeholders including, university, industry, and education.
