new thread



because customer service is job no. 1 at hss, here's a new thread. and it's only weeks late. (seriously: my apologies although, as you may know, most of my steelers writin' is now at steelers lounge.)

game thread, week 16: carolina panthers



the last time these two teams met, jonathan dwyer rushed for 86 yards, and manny sanders had 66 yards receiving. tonight, i'd just settle for a win and no injuries.

"russ grimm has been offered and has accepted the steelers' head coaching position, a source in pittsburgh confirmed late saturday. grimm, 47, succeeds bill cowher, who coached the steelers for 15 seasons before resigning jan. 5. the hiring of grimm will be announced monday at a news conference."-mike prisuta, january 21, 2007"i fear steelers' training camp... if i went more often, i'd have to deal with people i don't like, namely the players, coaches, football media and especially the fans."- mark madden, july 22, 2005 "you'd think a team [pittsburgh] scrambling for cheap alternatives would have taken a look at qb drew henson, whom the cowboys acquired for a third-round pick"- joe starkey, march 14, 2004"in the days leading up to saturday and in the minutes immediately following the no. 11 overall selection, bill cowher kept insisting the steelers didn't expect to be drafting this high very often. but in the wake of taking ben roethlisberger in the first round, you have to wonder if picking in the vicinity of the top 10 isn't about to become habit forming. same time next year, fellas?"- mike prisuta, april 25, 2004*captain pantload watch archives*



reviews

"... get your fix of off-beat steelers analysis from the heels, sox & steelers blog ... [ryan wilson is] heavy on the steelers, given their february success, and his captain pant load award, which is the exact opposite of the pulitzer prize, is hilarious (except when he picks on columnists from one of america's great newspapers, in which case he's sophomoric and ill-informed)." - bill toland, pittsburgh post-gazette "a bit unpolished, with few of the production extras youâ€™ll find on the bigger sites, this blog gets by on good writing, consistency and attention to detail." - deadspin.com "... this heels, sox, & steelers blog is about as creative as daniel laruso's halloween costume in the first karate kid. boring? check. pointless? check. insightful? x. i mean come on, if this is the trash that is trying to dethrone the king, then i'm going to have a long, successful, prosperous reign. bring in the ladies!!!'" - anonymous, via the comments "nice picks."- c. long, referring to my week 18 nfl selections "if you're going to parade around like a journalistic all-american then you have to be able to take scathing critiques from established critics such as myself." - d. mccarthy, via email "heels, sox, and steelers is of a lower quality...and he makes up for what he lacks in analysis with enthusiasm, frequency of posting, and attention to detail." - bayes.blogspot.com
