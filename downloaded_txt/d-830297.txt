the exquisite sound, range, and touch of the cfx all combine to give me a sense of pianistic and musical control that makes me feel inspired, excited, and confident every time i walk onstage. no other piano allows for such clarity of rhythm, expression, and voicing. when i'm playing a cfx, i feel like i have an entire orchestra at my fingertips.
