february 23rd, 2011 11:07 am - he's turned off his targeting computercritterhartif star wars has taught us anything, its that sometimes you just have to turn off your targeting computer and go with what you know to be true.your computer is only as good as the programmer who set it up. the information could be off, or the processing of said information could be bugged. in general, its all good. but when it really matters, you need to look past the programming, open your eyes, and see whats actually in front of you.when the instruction manual is over 1000 years old, you shouldn't put much reliance on it either. you can't program your blu-ray player using a vcr manual. http://goo.gl/2vycotags:bible, evolutionlocation:workemo:bouncy

august 19th, 2009 01:18 pm - digital rightscritterhartit's legal for me to make a backup copy of my media, in case of theft or destruction, except that owning or building the tools to allow me to create the copy is not legal -- although arguably this makes any turing machine attached to a cd/dvd/blu-ray drive illegal.it's legal for me to watch tv or listen to radio for free by receiving transmissions, and i can even record them and keep the recording indefinitely as long as i only use it for personal use, but it's illegal for me to stream media over the internet and capture the stream, and it's illegal for me to transmit over the internet.it's legal for me to trade or lend cds, dvds, etc. with friends i know, or to buy or sell used copies, as long as they're legitimate (not pirated), but it's illegal for me to use the internet to facilitate either the search or the trading or to expand my group of "friends", even though i could go to a public library and essentially achieve the same ends by swapping media with a large group of people (the public) who i don't actually know.if something is out of print, or censored, or otherwise unavailable, but copyrighted, i have no legal recourse to obtain a copy.tags:drm, piratebaylocation:seltek

june 1st, 2009 04:31 pm - wtf? why the hype?critterhartmicrosoft's new addon looks pointless in this stage of the 360's life. people who bought xbox's want to play sport games and fps's. neither of which work well for video based motion capture. hmm, so what would work well you ask? not a whole lot i can think of.sony made the eyetoy, it did nothing. had some stupid gimmicky games that had stuff flying around the screen that you could knock over and some dance games. thats really about all you can do with it though. i mean, you can't simulate running and moving very well, jumping and action's would get very old very fast. yet they insist this is gaming without controllers. makes sense, cause you can't do video capture if your hands are connected to a controller, kinda defeats the purpose.it captures audio too. ok, thats cool. who cares? xbox has a headset. it already captures audio. the showed it working with some fake ai thing. sega tried voice capture with seaman, turns out people didn't want to sit in their rooms and talk to their video game longer then it took to teach it how to say penis.so, you can dance around in front of your tv and shout things at it for 200 bucks. revolutionary how?no tactile feedback what-so-ever. no ease of command buttons. no force pickup. no nothing..  http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/06/01/microsoft-previews-project-natal/the video there is awesome. shows the on screen image of the guy dancing, looks like he is having a seizure and he keeps spinning when the dude isn't. the clipping i can forgive because i assume its an early build. but the accuracy looks off to be the big huge debut i'm sure they were planning. no excuse for that to not be perfect at this stage.tags:e3, microsoft, milo, project natallocation:seltekemo:confused

november 18th, 2008 09:12 am - the work thangcritterhartbeen doing this work thing for a while not. its going pretty well. i must say this place really does seem like it could carry me a while and pretty far. we just picked up 3 new clients even while the economy is crashing all around us. and it seems like we may pull in someone elses work load soon as they operated inside of a company that no longer wishes to have an inside tech department. big thing a bout that is they also do work for a bunch of the main companies clients. so all of that work would also fall into our lap.havn't tried the new wow expansion yet. i certainly want to check it out on my tv one day. but, eh, it can wait. games not going anywhere.tags:tv, work, wowlocation:seltekemo:goodtune:hum of servers

august 1st, 2008 09:10 am - tbs 2 (2009)critterhart“you kind of wonder what has happened to the brothers… they have been living way back in the valleys of ireland with their father on a family run sheep farm, way beyond the reach of technology or men. way out there. it’s been sort of a bucolic existence, hard working pioneer-esque type stuff. they have long hair and beards, and stuff like that. you get the sense that they’ve been hibernating to come back. and there is an event that transpires in boston. a priest murdered in a church and the body is rigged to make it look like the saints did it. the one guy that the brothers and father have contact with is il duce’s brother. so he gets the first notion of this, puts his jeep in gear and tells the brothers what happened. and without even thinking of it the boys are up and out of there … they cut their hair, digg up their rosaries, strap on their guns, and they’re gone! and dad has to stay back because something is wrong with him, and you can tell he doesn’t have much time left. so when the brothers smuggle themselves back to the us, back to boston, in a very understandable way. and one of the guys they meet along the way is a hispanic american named romeo. and romeo ends up becoming like the third brother or saint, fourth i guess if you’re gonna consider billy. he’s a lot more of a bad ass than rocco was. but his comedy is that he wants to be a lot more a part of this. so there is a lot of humor that comes from that. he’s hopefully going to be played by a friend of mine named clifton collins, who was in capote and frankie flowers in traffic.”tags:movieslocation:seltek

may 16th, 2008 09:55 am - sponsored by racer motorscritterhartnice! speed racer was quite fun! super ultra mega groundbreakingly citizen cainesque, it is not. but then i would have pee'd on the screen if it had been. super fun cheesy entertainingly cool beans, it most certainly is! its actually very well directed, a lot of the sequences are more then i was even expecting. the transitions and storytelling. a few parts are done so well its like watching a 15 minute movie trailer that keeps pulling you in and getting deeper and deeper as it goes. and its pretty as hell. you really can't beat the visuals for what they are. a few weird things like purple smoke and the like, but over all it flowed in a way that was seamless and smooth.i really liked it, it was so much like the cartoon. a lot of off the wall things happening, but it was so fun and moved so fast who gives a shit?! thats what it was supposed to be, and i really hope they follow it up and keep the same styling.iron man and indy 4 are next up on the viewing list.rawk on!tags:movies, speed racerlocation:seltekemo:cheerful

march 5th, 2008 10:24 am - appendage to the last postcritterhartthe title "pirates were the warriors of heaven!" may have confused some of you. you see, i'm sure many of you have heard the legend of the flying spaghetti monster that created us all. well i'm here to tell you that that is total bs!the fsm was infact trying to destroy everything! thats right! i've done extensive research in the matter and while my sources are undisclosed, i can assure you that god himself will back me up. or should i say admiral blackbeard. ya, admiral. knocking his rank down to captain was part of the massive cover-up. you see, in the beginning of time, admiral blackbeard and his armada of angel class ships sailed the vast ocean that was called oceana, which encompassed this planet we now call earth. well, they used chests full of magical golden disks to raise the land from under the water. earth enriched with life which would rapidly spawn plant life. they did this for hundreds of years, shaping and molding our planet into what it is today. then, just as they were nearing completion of our planet, a new threat arrived.now they had battled many evil sea creatures in their time here, but this new threat was capable of covering everything in its noodly appendages for all of time, drowning its victims in a very tomatoy sauce with not enough garlic. the meatballs it shot were devastating even to the angel class ships with their halo barrier and holy plated armor. the battle ensued until admiral blackbeard ordered his last remaining vessels to reach land, and begin spawning a new inhabitant to this earth he had created. while the last of his men left him to face the evil horrible flying spaghetti monster, he charged at it in his jesus battleship and won the day; but not without dooming himself as well. the fsm erupted in a huge explosion of pasta proportions. but the sacrifice that was made ensured that this planet and its people would live on and continue to take care of this watery world. unfortunately... the explosion launched meatballs at such a high rate, they destroyed the last of the angel class ships, sinking them into the depths. few of the men created knew of this battle. those that did were persecuted for damning the creature that gave them so much meat to eat. names were changed, and pirates were given a bad rap because they were evil and killed the god that fed man. atleast...thats how they saw it. later of course the egyptians would retell the tale and people would read it from their pyramids and write the book known as the bible. only the story got more and more watered down as it went. but this my friends, is the truth. if you can prove me wrong, i'll give you a dollar!tags:fsm, jesus, pirateslocation:seltekemo:bouncy

march 5th, 2008 09:57 am - pirates were the warriors of heaven!critterhart"'every public school teacher in the state's k-12 school system shall have the affirmative right and freedom to objectively present scientific information relevant to the full range of scientific views regarding biological and chemical evolution in connection with teaching any prescribed curriculum regarding chemical or biological origins"http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_education_edblog/2008/03/will-we-be-hear.htmlwhy should teachers be obligated to teach to a curriculum to all the other subjects but not science? i say let them teach math that contradicts mathematics, grammar that contradicts english, history revised to their personal taste, imaginary geography, using non standardized mapping systems, let them teach kids the wrong organs. for example if i believe people have 3 hearts, why shouldn't i be allowed to teach that? if some teacher thinks that the solar system rotates around the earth, or that the earth is flat, or that heavier objects fall faster, well whose to say they aren't allowed to teach that? isn't the real purpose of having a teaching job to have a platform to spread your personal views to other peoples children?why stop at the subject matter? if teachers think children learn best by playing outside all day long and having no homework, well aren't the teachers the ones who are supposed to know how beast to teach? that is their life long profession isn't it? its not like we let the teachers dictate what the current state of scientific knowledge is... oh.. wait.. that is what this bill is about isn't it?tags:id, jesus, sciencelocation:seltekemo:enthralledtune:the meeting in the next room

february 18th, 2008 10:03 am - big group vs big corp = time gamecritterharthd died. and thats very sad. why should sony get money for every disc sold? fuck you warner bros! bugs bunny may be awesome, and that fricken dancing frog kicks ass! but why would you take that dirty ass money from sony? wonna know why they gave you all of that money? do you?! cause they will make it all back from you over time anyway! plus they will go through the roof from everyone else paying them royalties too! and last time i checked sony pictures was a competitor. true, they aren't that big of a competitor, but that doesn't mean you want to feed the fire does it? so now we all need a dvd & a blu-ray player. thats kinda shitty too yo.real format standards are just that, they are standards. like hd could play dvd cause it was the same only upgraded. atleast after 2 previously failed format runs they finally learned that they have to throw enough money around to the right people to win.tags:dvd, hdlocation:seltekemo:geekytune:red hot chili peppers - tear

december 31st, 2007 12:55 pm - dvd vs. hd & brcritterhartso lets say that vhs is a burger. say a mcdonald's burger, one of the cheap ones. dvds bring that up to a good chicken dish, with a side of pasta and those breadsticks that are soft and warm. hd-dvd or br might bring it up to lobster, but really, how often do you go have lobster? and that's just it. you go out to have lobster with all the trimmings and a good desert - movies. you don't usually bring home a lobster and cook it because it's a lot of trouble and it's just easier to stick with what's in the fridge. i mean the chicken is already defrosting and you have a can of the pop-n-fresh breadsticks. you've even got a bag of salad. for lobster, you'll need to get out the special plates, and melt some butter - do you even have butter, or just margarine? and your wife isn't a really a big fan of lobster, she'd just as soon have chicken. if she has to cook, she's not even sure how to cook the lobster anyway. mmmmm, breadsticks...tags:br, breadsticks, dvd, hdlocation:homeemo:full

august 8th, 2007 02:24 pm - getting eaten by a candy barcritterhartso yesterday i learned that we are not part of the milky way galaxy. nope. we are infact part of sagatarious(?). we are however being consumed by the evil that is the mw. luckily we seem to have stabilized in one of its spirals. we are however still cocked sideways which ain't really cool. we can't just stay like that, which is only important to know, because that means we are going to shift. drastically i would assume because of how something as large as a planet would handle a slight swing. the mayas based a very accurate calendar on the stars. it ends abruptly soon. now i like lines, they can be straight, bent, curvy, and then can even circle around stuff. i see a line here. 2012, here we come! =dblah blah that was kinda stupid. i admit it, just trying to get back into the swing of things. seems they found a planet thats almost twice the size of jupiter, and for some reason they think that shouldn't even be possible, but, i dunno. guess i could read up more on it. but if i do that i may end up thinking along the lines of a planet that consumes other planets and that its headed our way. which i am saying btw. we are going to be pulled in and eaten by this thing. don't even try to object to it,because you can't disprove me. praise the lord!tags:galaxy, lines, planetslocation:faulconeremo:la latune:office jibberjabber

december 19th, 2006 09:56 am - the news today: the iphone | spinning solar buildings | mapping the milkyway | death of scooby doocritterhartso they want to build lots of these solar powered skyscrapers, that spin 360 degrees.sounds kinda cool. i wouldn't mind having a view like that, the solar powered aspect of it seems like a gimmick to generate some buzz, but none the less, its still fricken cool!linksys beat apple to the punch on releasing an iphone. yep, spelled like that too. so it imitates the ipod brand as much as possible. the iphone isn't an mp3/phone deal though. its and internet phone. it uses skype to call people across the internet. so more need for home phone service. you just need an internet connection anywhere and you can make free calls to anyplace on earth and soon the moon.google is having some fun, atleast i would be if i were them. they get to now go work at nasa. organizing and playing in the massive amounts of data nasa has gathered about the moon, mars, and general earth atmosphere. their goal is claimed to be about putting the information on the internet in searchable form for all to see. but it is just of course another step in googles main goal of world domination. i welcome them and wish them much luck on this new leg of their journey!last, and most sad, joseph barbera died at the age of 95. as you can probably guess he was the father of most of your classic hanna-barbera characters. there should be a 24 hour wacky races and hanna-barbera olympics on today. it would be the only way to truly honor him and the characters he left behind.tags:barbera, google & nasa, iphone, news, spinning solar skyscraperslocation:work

november 15th, 2006 11:02 am - jesus doesn't like cookies! how could you ever trust him about anything?critterhartso, yet another monkey wearing a suit and shouting about the divine goodness and mindlessness of a giant man in the sky has been proven el'gay. i think i know why this situation keeps presenting itself as well; think about this, whats the main icon for jesus freaks? a naked man in bondage on a cross. not only this, but its the last thing they see when they go to sleep, blue-balled yet again due to the no-sex thing. then they wakeup and bam! what do they see? naked man hanging from cross. poor stupid saps, they really have no choice you know? and they can't just go and be gay once the conversion is done, because well, god would not approve. that means no one can know about it. so whats the only choice? little kids, of course! why? they can be scared and won't try to do the whole blackmail thing. if fear doesn't work, they can be rewarded with a free ticket into heaven for servering one of gods aides. kinda like one of santa's helpers you know?the killers - bonesthe standard - unicorns & chemicalstags:gay, jesus, naked man, pedolocation:workemo:chippertune:u2 - window in the skies
