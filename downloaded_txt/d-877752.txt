the academy of medicine was formed over 100 years ago. prior to this there had been medical societies; each catering for a different branch of medicine but they overlapped one another. for many years wide-ranging discussions had been held on how best to bring these bodies together so that they would have the advantage of union yet


 preserve their independence. in the event a solution was found. in november 1882 in the royal college of surgeons an academy was formed by the amalgamation of the four main medical societies - the dublin society of surgeons, the medical society of the college of physicians, the pathological society and the dublin obstetrical society.
