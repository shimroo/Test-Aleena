real-time water quality monitoring for marine science | sims
the sydney institute of marine science (sims) is a collaborative research and training studio that hosts a range of different research projects. key focuses include habitat restoration, conservation efforts, and mitigating the effects of climate change on oceans and marine species. sims utilizes ysi exo sondes to monitor real-time water quality and gather continuous, reliable data they can trust.







ysi vehicles | auvs | asvs | services
our three vehicle offerings are the rqpod and hycat, autonomous surface vehicles or asvs, and the ecomapper, an autonomous underwater vehicle or auv.  ysi has worked with global experts to design vehicle platforms that are rugged yet affordable for environmental monitoring. our vehicles are optimized for different environments, applications, and can be used for many kinds of surveys, including water quality, water quantity, hydrographic, bathymetric, imaging, scour, and photogrammetry, to name a few.







ysi 9220 toc analzyer | overview
introducing the 9220 total organic carbon (toc) analyzer, developed from over 50 years of experience in measuring toc for water quality monitoring. leveraging ysi’s heated persulfate and ndir technology, the 9220 provides unmatched performance, reliability, versatility, and ease of use.







5 reasons to upgrade from pro plus to proquatro
since 2006, the professional plus has set the industry standard for water quality sampling, but the time has come for us to say farewell and move toward the future. now, as the field season approaches, we are excited to crown the proquatro, ysi’s latest handheld in the professional series line, as the new successor to the pro plus throne.
