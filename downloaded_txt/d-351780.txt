living cheap apartmentsjapan isn’t all futuristic skyscrapers and cutting-edge technology. step outside the glitzy city centres, and you’ll find plenty of ageing, low-cost apartment blocks dotting the suburbs. these buildings, often constructed in the economic boom years, have seen better days, with faded exteriors, cramped layouts, and minimal insulation. they cater to students, low-income workers, and older…  read more cheap apartmentscontinue       eating tonkatsutonkatsu: japan’s way of proving that deep-frying is an art form. it’s a crispy, golden-brown pork cutlet, breaded with panko (japanese breadcrumbs) and deep-fried to perfection. usually, it’s made from pork loin (rosu katsu) for that juicy fat content or pork fillet (hire katsu) for a leaner bite. either way, it’s crunchy on the outside,…  read more tonkatsucontinue       living service areas dininghighway service areas in japan have seen significant upgrades, and food quality has improved as a result. unlike

regional specialities, freshly prepared meals, and even…  read more service areas diningcontinue       living | shooting japanese chessshogi is japan’s version of chess, but with a brutal twist—captured pieces switch sides and can be redeployed against their former owner. it’s a game of relentless warfare, where no piece is ever truly out of play. the board is a 9×9 grid, slightly larger than a chessboard, and the pieces are pentagonal wedges with…  read more japanese chesscontinue       revealing | shooting sushi mastera sushi master (or itamae, meaning “in front of the board” in japanese) is a highly skilled chef specialising in the art of sushi-making. becoming an itamae isn’t just about knowing how to slice fish and roll rice—it’s a gruelling, years-long apprenticeship that demands precision, patience, and an almost religious devotion to technique. rice is the foundation of…  read more sushi mastercontinue       learning | revealing leica high isoafter using the jpegs straight from the leica m11, i started noticing how film-like the high iso files looked. unlike many digital cameras that aggressively smooth out noise, the m11 retains a fine, organic grain structure, giving images a textured quality reminiscent of classic film stocks. the noise doesn’t feel artificial or obtrusive; instead, it…  read more leica high isocontinue       living | revealing inokashira pondinokashira pond is the centrepiece of inokashira park, located in kichijoji, tokyo. it’s a picturesque spot, especially famous for its cherry blossoms in spring. the pond is part of the kanda river water system and has been around for centuries—it even supplied drinking water to edo (old tokyo) during the early edo period. a fun (or mildly ominous) fact: the…  read more inokashira pondcontinue       exploring kamba la passthe ride to kamba la pass is as thrilling as it is breathtaking—literally. as the vehicle winds its way up the steep, twisting road, the air grows noticeably thinner, and the effects of high altitude begin to set in. at 4,794 metres (15,728 feet) above sea level, altitude sickness is a real concern, especially for…  read more kamba la passcontinue       living | revealing izakaya nighta night out at an izakaya is an experience that blends great food, endless drinks, and a lively atmosphere. these japanese gastropubs range from smoky, dimly lit joints packed with salarymen to sleek, modern venues with digital ordering systems. the moment you walk in, you’re hit with a chorus of staff shouting “irasshaimase!” welcoming you…  read more izakaya nightcontinue       connecting | revealing spaceshipsome of tokyo’s trains have gone full sci-fi mode—no more crumpled paper ads on the sides. instead, it’s all sleek lcd screens, bombarding you ads. the trains themselves are unsettlingly clean, almost too perfect, with no gum under the seats, no forgotten newspapers, and no sun-bleached posters that overstayed their welcome. it’s impressive, sure, but…  read more spaceshipcontinue       living random crossingah, the 28mm nokton—great choice. that lens has some serious character, and on the m11, it’s a proper street photography weapon. the colours you get from that combo are just stunning, especially wide open. and yeah, the m11’s size is a huge plus—big enough to feel solid, small enough to carry everywhere without screaming, “look…  read more random crossingcontinue       living ufo catchera ufo catcher is a type of arcade claw machine, originally popularised by sega, where players attempt to grab prizes using a mechanical claw. these machines are a staple of arcades in japan and other parts of asia, often featuring plush toys, figurines, and exclusive collectibles. unlike traditional claw machines, ufo catchers often have a…  read more ufo catchercontinue       revealing leica black and whitesince i use black and white for focus peaking in live view on the rare occasions i skip the viewfinder—like when close focusing—i figured i’d give the black-and-white jpeg a shot. these are straight out of the camera (sooc) with the high-contrast profile. quite liking it!  read more leica

templecontinue       living perpetual renewaltokyo’s endless churn of demolition and rebuilding comes with a noticeable trend—houses are shrinking. the city’s obsession with perpetual renewal means that many homes barely make it past 30 years before being torn down, their remains carted away in mini dump trucks. but what replaces them is often even smaller than before. rising land prices,…  read

and somehow, you’re always one sock short. if you take the train, brace yourself for the peak-hour crush. even the politest commuters turn into efficient sardines, and squeezing in with a child can feel like playing tetris on hard mode. if…  read more morning commutecontinue       living kerosene heaterkerosene heaters remain a common sight in japan, particularly in older homes, small

hits you with a thick, unmistakable scent—earthy, rancid, smoky, and oddly rich. that’s yak butter candles at work. these traditional butter lamps, burning day and night as offerings, fill the temples with a dense aroma that clings to the ancient wooden beams and centuries-old murals. yak butter,…  read more yak butter candlescontinue  page navigation1 2 3 … 34 next pagenext © 2004-2025 benoist
