    the foundation quarter horse was the original great american ranch horse.   bob denhardt on the founding of aqha in 1940 . . ."we were looking for horses like little joe and joe moore, ballymooney and red dog, guinea pig and possum, zantanon and king, jack mccue and bullet. they weren’t thoroughbreds . . .and they didn’t look like thoroughbreds. . .  all were exceptionally well muscled, and it was probably this feature that first caught your eye.. . . these features were clearly characteristic of a breed. they were as unique in their conformation as they were in their ability to work cattle!"   do the above statements describe your quarter horse? do you think that you might own one of these rare and unique individuals?  if you do, then welcome to the foundation quarter horse association.   if you can meet our high standards you have a horse you should be justifiably proud of.
 
    the first step in registering your horse with fqha is to request a foundation percentage calculation to determine if it is eligible. only horses that are 85% and above foundation quarter horse blood are eligible for fqha registration.  if your horse is determined to be eligible, we will email you a registration and membership application within 72 hours.   fqha is dedicated to the promotion, and preservation of foundation bred quarter horses. fqha has the highest registration requirements of any foundation association.    and don't forget, we can do percentage calculations for you on horses you are thinking of buying, stallions you are considering breeding to, etc.  it's best to be sure before you spend your money on another horse or breeding fee.
 
*please note: official calculations, which are required for fqha registration, can only be performed by the fqha office.   no one can claim an fqha percentage on any horse unless that percentage is official and has been completed by fqha and/or it's agents.
