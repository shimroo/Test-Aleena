who are the singing men? 
"show your strength god, so no one can miss it. we are out singing the good news!" 
the passage from psalm 21:13 in the message is the testimony of the singing men of north central texas. these ministers of music, music educators, and church staff members find great joy in lifting each other in prayer, and singing together at eight concerts annually.
