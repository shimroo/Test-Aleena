"janssen landscaping put in a stone walkway, a new patio, a sand box, and steps into the water to integrate with our new dock in the spring of 2015.  before choosing janssen, we received proposals from two other contractors. their proposal was the most thorough of any we received. their work was completed on time, and the landscaping was more beautiful than we ever imagined. the people working on the landscaping were professional courteous, and very accommodating."
