welcome
the niu computer science department has been successfully educating computer professionals for almost 40 years. our programs keep pace with industry demands for well-trained graduates who are ready to assume vital roles in the field of computer science immediately upon entry into the work force. in addition, our ms program has undergone significant changes with the establishment of a track system which will allow more flexibility for students, as well as through the creation of a thesis option in addition to our traditional course-only approach. i encourage you to examine the rest of the department’s web site to find out more about our successful curriculum and various departmental activities. — nicholas karonis, chair
