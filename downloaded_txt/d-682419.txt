* all costs and prices quoted are from when this article was written. therefore, they are approximate, vary locally, and subject to market forces and should be used only as a guide. identify the issues in the following list and the most appropriate solution.

when to call our electricians in carindale
1. power surge protection

power surges can be caused by lightning strikes, damaged power lines, faulty appliances and poor electrical wiring in the home. a surge lasts only a microsecond, but frequent surges can damage electrical components connected to your home and significantly shorten their life span. get surge protection if you have expensive electrical appliances or run a home office. brisbane weather means we have many electrical storms when surges typically happen.
2. power fluctuations and dips

as with power surges, power dips and brownouts are often caused by faulty or low-quality mains-connected appliances that consume a lot of power when switched on.
3. faulty light switches 

dimmer switches that do not set the light correctly are often due to poor workmanship or substandard products. if you have just moved into a new carindale home and find light switches that don’t seem to activate anything, this could be a sign that the switches have been replaced and the fittings removed, or there could be a fault with the socket, circuit or wiring. contact an electrician in carindale if you have faulty switches or lights problems.

when it comes to electricity in the home, your safety is paramount. flickering lights, high bills and damaged appliances can be signs of electrical problems in your home’s circuitry. want some electrical safety tips for your home in carindale? read our article on how to avoid electrical hazards.
4. frequent power tripping

high-power appliances, such as microwaves and hair dryers, can trip circuit breakers, primarily if other devices draw power from the same source. a circuit breaker is designed to protect you and your home. if it trips, it’s a sign that it’s doing its job.

look at what you were using when the breaker tripped. for example, if it’s a hairdryer, try using a low setting. or limit the power consumption of a single circuit if you are using high-power appliances.
5. circuit overloaded

one of the leading causes of frequent tripping of circuit breakers is circuit overloading. most houses and flats, even newer ones, do not have enough sockets to power an entire home entertainment appliance, for example. if the circuit breaker in your home trips frequently, it could be due to an overload in the circuit. prevent this by:

    remove devices, not in use (e.g., phone chargers draw current even when they are not plugged in).
    spread out your power needs. don’t overload a single circuit.
    pay attention to how you connect appliances around the house: what is used and unnecessary. 

6. lights that are too bright or too dim

if some lights in the house seem excessively bright while others are dim, there are two likely causes:

    mismatched bulbs with different wattages: check that all bulbs are identical.
    bad connection of the primary neutral: this will continue to cause problems for the house until it is repaired by a professional.

recessed lights (such as downlights)come with safety devices that cut the power supply to the globe if it gets too hot. the wattage is either too high, or the ceiling insulation is too close to the bulb, causing excessive heat.
7. electric sparks

an electric spark can look dangerous, but they are typically harmless; like a static discharge, it reminds us that electricity is dangerous if not used correctly.
electric shocks usually occur when an appliance is switched on or off. the problem may be in the appliance or the wiring. you can test it by plugging in another appliance and see if the results are reproducible, but you only risk another electric shock. in most cases, it is best to speak to an electrician.
8. high electricity bills

you can reduce the cost of your electricity bill by doing the following:

     identify electrical appliances that may be causing high power use
     unplugging appliances and chargers when not in use.
     repair damaged wiring or circuits.
    switching to led light globes

9. lightbulbs keep blowing out

there are several reasons why your bulbs blow too often:

    the wattage is too high
    insulation is too close to the bulb
    poor wiring in the power supply circuit
    faulty wiring in the mains
    the total wattage of a dimmer switch is too high.
    if the light is flickering, there is probably a bad connection in the circuit.

time to find a local carindale electrician?

paint colours for a hampton style home





brisbane painting pros(07) 3064 062517 pleasant crthttps://www.brisbanepaintingpros.com.au/https://brisbane-painting-pros.business.site/https://www.google.com/maps?cid=9873764425610811621
choosing a paint theme for a coastal or hamptons style home is not something to be nervous about.it is a current styling trend with many inspiration guides and colour choices, so you can choose a colour scheme that you love!


adding your favourite colours can easily be done with soft furnishings, so the biggest decision you have to make is what the wall colour will be to plan what soft furnishing colours and textures you can add to create the layers in the room.
long gone are the stark, minimalist traits of the late '90s and early 2000's coastal or hamptons styling does bring in the same elements of choosing simple colour choices, but they allow layers of the texture of soft furnishing and statement pieces.it is no longer "white on white."
are you planning on painting your home with a crisp white paint?when you initially think about what colours to use for your home, you realise that choosing "white paint" is not as easy as it sounds.

what colour should you paint your walls depending on the type and shade of wood in your room?the answer is surprisingly complex, but it does hinge on one feature in a home: the timber finishes and flooring in a home.many homes in brisbane have timber or timber look flooring and choosing a shade that tones in with your flooring is the key thing to do.
cooler tones to paint your walls
from a warm white to a cooler, green and grey tints, many different tones work well with various timbers!warmer whites tend to blend more seamlessly with the warmer timbers, but again, the complementary cool green tint also works if it's not too grey timber you could use for an even fresher look.when using warm whites, be aware that they can make your room seem smaller than it is, so if space isn't an issue, go ahead and choose a warmer colour.adding more grey to a modernised white can give your space that new look you're after.
beiges are typically a cool neutral colour with an orange undertone. however, those who want to balance out this cold tone can go opposite the wheel and find warmer colours with hints of green in them, like peach or coral, for more warmth without being too overpowering.
love the colour blue?light blue is a popular choice for timber as it blends in well.however, if you have darker or more red timbers, consider using purple undertones like grey to blend the colours.
paint colours for your walls

to start getting your paint inspiration, head into your nearest paint store to pick up whites and neutrals' current colour swatches.make sure you know what your flooring is or have a sample of it to take in with you so you can quickly choose the shades that will work in with your flooring.
after narrowing down a few favourites, take sample pots home and paint them up on different surfaces of your room!this will ensure you get the right hue for every space.make sure it's painted with two coats, and you allow them to dry completely before you start comparing the colours.we also suggest painting the sample paint up next to the cornices and skirting boards so that you can see the difference in the colour tone when it up against a crip white painted trim.also, look at the painted areas at different times of the day with different lights. natural light and artificial lights will bring out different tones in the paint.
now that you have selected your paint choice, you can get started with booking a brisbane painter or trying and doing the work yourself.
