welcome to the ohio ministry networkthe ohio ministry network is a fellowship of nearly 300 ohio churches, more than 900 credentialed ministers, and thousands of church leaders across the buckeye state driven by leader development, church health, church multiplication and missions partnership.we are committed to the common cause of developing leaders to multiply disciples of jesus by the spirit’s power as we devote ourselves to worshiping god, developing believers, and reaching out to the lost and hurting through evangelism and acts of compassion.through the connected leadership of our network resource center in columbus, fourteen geographical areas covering ohio, and a variety of ministry-related networks, we encourage one another through communications, resources, events, training, and prayer.
