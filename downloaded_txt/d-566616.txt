greetings!
        our family has been in business serving fiber enthusiasts since 1982.  our goal is to provide reliable, friendly service with natural, quality products at reasonable prices.  we're small enough to provide you with the personal attention and assistance you deserve, yet large enough to offer one of the largest selections of yarns, natural dyes, weaving and spinning tools, equipment, and fiber-related books in the midwest.          our specialties include continuous strand weaving looms, natural dyes  and dye aids from alkanet to zinc, and nature-dyed yarns and wool potholder loops.  self-published books and dvd's include:  "continuous strand weaving method, techniques and projects on triangle, square, and rectangle looms", and "nature provides dyes for rainbows".         we're looking forward to working with you!naturally,  carol leigh brack-kaiser
