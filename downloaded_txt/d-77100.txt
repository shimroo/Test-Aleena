breathe, you’re in trentino

picture yourself leisurely enjoying the wonders of nature. picture yourself taking your time and exploring alpine woods, valleys, rivers and lakes. picture yourself discovering a fresh sense of balance and well-being as you walk in the mountains, relax on the snow or sit and savour a glass of sparkling trentodoc wine.
with its stunning blend of natural marvels, culture and traditions, trentino can offer all of this in the heart of the italian alps, where the towering peaks stretch up into the blue sky above the trentino dolomites.
