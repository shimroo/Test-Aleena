what people are saying













nonna’s has this whole pandemic to go order thing down to a science. the food is so creamy and delicious and still pretty good-sized portions. the pizzas are heavy duty and if you think you have seen a calzone, well let me tell you that it's probably nothing close to the size of this monster! the garlic cheesy bread is a must. all around delicious and filling authentic italian meal. we will continue to come here for many years with our family as we have done for the last 15+years.— stephanie s.













“we ordered again from nonna emilia and we picked it up. the pizza is the best i've had in my life and i've had them all over the country. they have a good system for ordering and picking up your food. you can feel safe going in and getting your order. i hope they hang on until this is over and we can eat inside again. great people. great food.”— vic t.













“oh my goodness, i'm so blessed! no hassle with all my pregnancy cravings and add ons. they were super kind and didn't give me any problems. they had everything nicely packed up for me, and even made life feel a little "normal" again with some friendly conversation! already putting together my "labor food" ideas! i sure know one will be their angel hair pasta!”— evelyn w.
