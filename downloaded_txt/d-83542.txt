dog origins:  explore the
    latest theories and discoveries on the 
origins and evolution of the domestic dog, canis lupus familiaris:


discoveries in
        2014:
 dogs pick up
        acoustic emotional cues as people do, and have similar brain areas for handling them.
        see what canine
        brain scans uncovered. 
 unique
        transmissible canine cancer dates back 11,000 years, has a mix of dog and wolf genes.
        test subjects were an aboriginal camp dog in australia and an american cocker spaniel from
        brazil.
discoveries in 2013:
 mtdna
        research hints at european origins of dogs - during the era 
of hunter-gathers at least 18,000 years ago, before farming
were
        dogs domesticated in europe? scientists disagree - and dna results a
        shock for canine origins researcher robert wayne
america's
        original dogs - with east asian origins - were not wiped out
and completely replaced, studies using mitochondrial dna show
dna
        confirms ancient asian origin for early american dogs - breeds tested: chihuahuas,
        peruvian hairless dogs, carolina dogs, arctic sled dogs.
dogs
        came to americas in several migrations, at least one with indian-
american ancestors, another with inuit ancestors, mtdna study shows
chinese
        native dogs split off from asian wolves about 32,000 years ago
and their brains changed, new genome research shows
genes
        of dogs and humans evolved in parallel starting about 32,000 years ago in
southeast asia, new study of dog and wolf genomes suggests
canine
        fossil dna from siberia puts dogs at 33,000 years old
33,000-year-old
        skull closer to dogs than wolves, its mtdna similar to
        
        modern breeds like tibetan mastiffs, siberian huskies
dogs
        evolved to digest early farmers' starchy foods  
learning
        to love cereal key to dog's co-evolution
earlier discoveries:
ancient
        cluster of 14 breeds discovered via genetic research
dingos
        & asia's pariah dogs: semi-tamed dog ancestors
evidence of ancient dogs in belgian cave
        & on russian plain
