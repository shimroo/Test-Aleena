this colorful
fantasy art "banknote," designed
by r. j. reed, chief graphic artist of the reed banknote co.,
sarasota, portrays
a beautiful and sweet lovebird, piwi,  who was reed's pet for
nearly a
dozen years.  see his story here. 
this limited edition "piwi island" bill is printed
on a special polymer plastic substrate that features hidden security
features which can be viewed using an ultra-violet light.  each
note also has a cool "see-through" holographic seal and is hand-signed
by reed, who has been designing money art since the
1960's and is one of the few people who makes a considerable portion of
his income designing fantasy notes.  on the back includes a
depiction of a painting of piwi by reed's wife chris.  piwi the
lovebird is also featured on many other reed banknotes and is the
unofficial "trademark" of the firm.  his image probably appears on
more different designs than any other bird in history!  this
note is
available from our new retail web store located at  currencybanknotes.com, 
along many other fine banknotes (genuine worldwide paper and polymer currency notes, as well as exquisite fantasy art bills, movie prop money, novelty bills, and
political funny money, designed by graphic artists, among many other interesting and collectible items, old and new)!  a new set of four different piwi notes joined the family
in january, 2019 - see grouping of $1, $2, $5, and $10 piwi above!
