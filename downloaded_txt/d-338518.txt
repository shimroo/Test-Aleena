from our founder:



“the chief concern of the church and its ministry should be the salvation of men. this concern should not be localized nor nationalized. it should extend to all places and to all men. it should be as broad as the world and as wide as humanity.”

b.h. carroll
founder and first president of southwestern baptist theological seminary
