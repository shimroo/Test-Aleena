i’ve pulled a lot of trailers and my trail king holds up better than any of them, no matter what i put on it.


- steven lough









hands down the best trailers  money can buy. no other specialized trailer has the integrity a trail king does. if your heavy specialized carrier shows up with anything other than a trail king they are simply ill prepared for the job.


- frontier specialized heavy transport









trail king wrote the book on customer service!! my experience was the best with brian hofer, he went well beyond customer service and provided an experience unmatched by most. i will always recommend trail king and their director of customer service for future opportunities.


- samuel skierski









only trailer i’ve ever owned that i haven’t been afraid to push to its limits.  quality built with minimal if any down time.


- ben bruinius









love my stepdeck! it’s light but built heavy duty!!


- jamie donaldson









trail king has a great product and my first pick for a heavy haul trailer.


- james west









out of all the trailers i’ve pulled i find trail king is the most user friendly. and in my opinion they build the best trailers in the industry.


- michael renner









i’m proud to own this piece of equipment and can’t tell you how much difference it makes using equipment that is perfectly tailored for the job i do.  it makes everything a breeze.  thanks again! this trailer is a masterpiece. best decision i ever made was to buy a trail king.


- brad a hunt & sons trucking
