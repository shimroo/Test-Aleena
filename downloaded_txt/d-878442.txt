we get new york working.



founded in 1985, the consortium for worker education (cwe) is a new york city based non-profit workforce development organization, overseeing a network of over 40 job training and placement providers across the five boroughs. cwe serves as the workforce development arm of the new york city central labor council, afl-cio, providing vital training services to incumbent members across 36 union locals. last year, approximately 34,000 individuals, both union and community members, were enrolled in over 3,700 cwe funded classes and placement initiatives.
