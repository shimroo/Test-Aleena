  welcome to peter duesberg's hiv/aids
        research web site. 
        peter h. duesberg, ph.d. is a professor of molecular and cell biology
        at the university of california, berkeley. biographical
        sketch
     he isolated the first cancer
        gene through his work on retroviruses in 1970, and mapped the genetic
        structure of these viruses. this, and his subsequent work in the same
        field, resulted in his election to the national academy of sciences in
        1986. he is also the recipient of a seven-year outstanding investigator
        grant from the national institutes of health. 
     on the basis of his experience
        with retroviruses, duesberg has challenged the virus-aids hypothesis in
        the pages of such journals as cancer research, lancet, proceedings of
        the national academy of sciences, science, nature, journal of aids, aids
        forschung, biomedicine and pharmacotherapeutics, new england journal of
        medicine and research in immunology. he has instead proposed the hypothesis
        that the various american/european aids diseases are brought on by the
        long-term consumption of recreational drugs and/or azt itself, which is
        prescribed to prevent or treat aids.  see the
        aids dilemma: drug diseases blamed on a passenger virus.

    
        for a detailed discussion of american/european
        aids as opposed to african aids, see the
        african aids epidemic: new and contagious or old under a new name.
 

     this is duesberg's official
        site, containing his written works on the subject, as well as other scientists
        that support his views such as kary b. mullis. kary mullis won
        the 1993 nobel prize in chemistry for his invention of the polymerase
        chain reaction technique for detecting dna. this is the technique used
        to search for fragments of hiv in aids patients. 
     prof. duesberg's findings
        have been a thorn in the side of the medical establishment and drug companies
        since 1987. instead of engaging in scientific debate, however, the only
        response has been to cut-off funding to further test professor's duesberg's
        hypothesis.  
     you can show your support
        by contributing a tax deductible donation
        to help support prof. duesberg's lab at the university of california berkeley.
