welcome to service chevrolet


are you ready to join two incredible automotive legacies? climbing behind the wheel of a car, truck, or suv emblazoned with the beloved bowtie makes you part of chevrolet’s extraordinary legacy as an automotive pioneer that shaped the american landscape—and buying a vehicle at service chevrolet makes you part of ours. 


family-owned since 1972, service chevrolet is honored to serve drivers from lafayette and the surrounding areas. we value our strong ties to the community and know the unique opportunity we have to serve cajun country by delivering a personalized dealership experience defined by respect and integrity. it’s your turn to experience the difference. 


experience our award-winning approach 


in business since 1972, service chevrolet has built a stellar reputation around our customer-centric approach that prioritizes relationships over selling cars. as a dealership, our business is naturally oriented around sales, but that shouldn’t require our customers to compromise or settle for anything less than extraordinary. instead, we challenge you to raise your standards and prepare for an exceptional experience defined by meaningful conversations, attentiveness, respect, and a mutual appreciation for the chevy lineup. 


prioritizing relationships shifts the focus away from the sale to your needs, allowing us to deliver a personalized experience. our integrity, transparency, and respect enrich those relationships, instilling confidence and trust. because of this, generations of drivers turn to us to handle their automotive needs because there’s no question about our motives or efforts to serve. this unique approach has earned us a stellar reputation throughout the state and nationwide recognition, including multiple general motors dealer of the year awards. 


shop our selection, new and used 


customers from lafayette, broussard, lake charles, baton rouge, and the surrounding areas know they can trust service chevrolet to have an exceptional selection of new and used cars, trucks, and suvs. transparency is at the heart of everything we do, with every model on our lot competitively priced to guarantee you’re getting the best deal. this saves you valuable time by eliminating the need to shop around or spend hours haggling over a fair price. 


this approach to pricing defines every vehicle on our lot, starting with chevrolet’s award-winning lineup. our inventory includes best-selling suvs like the equinox, tahoe, and suburban, alongside other popular options like the blazer, trax, and trailblazer. trucks are also plentiful and include midsize road warriors like the colorado, full-size powerhouses like the silverado 1500, and heavy-duty workhorses like the silverado hd. these vehicles are also staples in our used inventory, each hand-selected and vetted to give you the best in one convenient location. 


confidence in your purchase: loans and leases


shopping for a new or used chevrolet is exciting, but that feeling often fades when you start the finance process. the fair price you negotiated on the lot is suddenly hundreds of dollars over budget, leaving you with buyer’s remorse and a diagnosable state of sticker shock. but what if the process looked different? what if you could truly enjoy finalizing the sale? 


service chevrolet promises a celebratory and exciting experience, especially after you say “yes” to the chevy of your dreams. our hassle-free guarantee stretches across our entire team, meaning our sales and finance experts have one common goal: to ensure your next vehicle aligns with your needs, from functional to financial. our finance experts will review your purchase options, helping you find the right lease or loan terms to accommodate your situation; they’ll go over every detail, eliminating potential sticker shock and instilling confidence in your purchase. 


the full-service treatment: service and parts


service chevrolet takes a long-term approach to our customers, knowing there’s much more to our business than selling cars. what do we mean? every vehicle—new or used—is an investment worth protecting. our team promises to help you protect and maximize your investment by handling all your service and repair needs from our state-of-the-art facility. 


our service department is run by factory-trained and certified technicians who operate with integrity and respect. as they constantly expand and hone their skills, you can expect our mechanics to handle everything from complex drivetrain and brake repairs to routine oil changes, tire rotations, and fluid checks. moreover, their talents guarantee they can work on every make and model, with the promise of treating each vehicle like their own.
