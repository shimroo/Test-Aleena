reviewing dating programs and systems
my honest reviews on the top-selling dating guides





dating programs review website


hello everyone!
i just want to welcome everyone to my dating course review site. as a guy who actually reads, studies, and implements dating techniques and guides, i will provide you with the best and yet honest reviews of the top dating programs, guides, and books out there. now, i know that some products are simply just junk and piece of crap info that even a 5 year knows. so when i am recommending or giving you reviews, i will only be giving you my honest opinion and basically straight up telling you if a system is good or not. i am very straight-forward and if i believe that a product is junk, then i will tell you. however, i don’t think it’ll be worth the effort to even review poor products, so everything that i’ll be reviewing, will be somewhat useful and good.
of course there are a lot of good and legit dating systems and dating guides out there. so, i’ll do my best not to be biased on one product and rate each product according to what i believe is good. i mean there are a ton of dating programs out there, so i’m sure i won’t be able to cover all of them, but i will cover the more famous ones and be reviewing those. i’ll be reviewing all kinds of dating products and is not limited to just dating guides. i’ll be reviewing relationship courses, dating sites, getting back together with your ex, pick-up artistry, or even some top-selling book about dating. from well known gurus like david deangelo, unique and different ways of dating like vin dicarlo, popular courses by josh pellicer, to relationship masters like ryan rivers.
i’ll also be giving you advice on these subjects as well. one thing that really intrigues me is the psychology of men and women. there are many differences between the two and i really did a lot of research on those differences. i mean, i have read tons of books going over the physical brains of men and women and just neuroscience in general.
i have been in the dating game for a really long time and i really know what’s good material and what’s not. i not only have studied dating and it’s sub-courses, but i have applied them with a lot of success as well. i also like to know how and why such techniques work, so i have actually learned a lot about psychology and neurology too.
check out some of our reviews like the vin dicarlo pandoras box. or you may also like an approach like the girlfriend activation system or the tao of badass. and if you want help with relationships and want to revive your love or even get back with your ex, then you can check out my relationship rewind review.
hopefully, you’ll be able to decide for yourself what the best dating guide is and hopefully you can use that info to take your love life to the next level. so take a look around and check out some of the reviews! thanks a lot!
