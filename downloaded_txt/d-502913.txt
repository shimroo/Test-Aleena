haiti
            the rebel by michel sanon

            ********
            who is to tell me when
            to celebrate my history?
            who is to tell me
            when to dress my wounds
            and to reminisce
            my trials, my sorrow
            when to shed tears
            over my brave children
            and to glorify their names?
            they suffered and died
            every bloody month
            of the bloody year.
            i was born
            of abject inhumanity
            with the noble destiny
            of carrying the sword
            of precious humanity
            in a new world
            cursed by the west storm
            and raped by the powers
            of greed, wickedness, and death.

            i am the mother of martyrs
            of survivors and overcomers.
            alone, i faced the wrath
            of this world's powers
            in march of 1802.
            their mighty venom
            could not cripple me.
            i stepped on the snakes head
            in may of 1803
            and created for ever
            the symbol of my pride.

            how many now really know
            my history?
            how many care?
            alone, with my hurting hands
            i broke the first link
            of the mighty chain
            of human curse
            called slavery.
            alone on the traitorous hill
            of the new world
            i carried the cross of a race
            into this century
            of furious revolution
            and industrialization
            refusing to get crucified.
            i've been chained
            i've been robbed
            i've been raped and stabbed
            and i have fought back
            fearlessly, continuously.
            alone i have paid and paid.
            i have paid the senseless price
            i have paid the endless price
            for my vital exploits.
            humanity at large
            enjoys the benefits
            gratelessly, pompously.

            every bloody month
            of every bloody year
            i have fought constantly
            with a burning spear
            stuck in my chest.
            sometimes it weakens me
            but i always rise
            high above the pain
            and the wickedness
            of powerful forces
            from near and far
            to claim my dignity.

            i have friends
            who suck up my blood
            when tired i fall asleep.
            they set my house ablaze
            to scare my children away
            from my wounded heart.
            though today i choose to stand
            and stand in pride and love
            with my dear family
            to celebrate in harmony
            our common history
            in the month of february
            i was alone when in vertières
            i rose to face the devil
            when hell broke loose
            unleashing its fire storm
            with waves of flame rushing
            to engulf me whole...
            alone in the vast universe
            i froze hell over
            and walked on its ashes
            to create my own history.
            nobody stood by my side.
            i alone remember.
            it was the eighteenth day
            of a month called
            november.

            *****************

            every november
            18, vertierres day, haitians, currently under us-led un occupation, remember
            the heroes of the haitian revolution. remember kapwa
            lamò, jean
            jacques dessalines (janjak), all the maroons, toya,
            defile, sanit belè,mari jann at crete-a-pierrot and how
            the haitian identity and indomitable courage was forged out of the fiery
            crucible of war against 300-years of western terror, tyranny and
            enslavement.
