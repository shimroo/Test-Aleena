    gilding
  



























antique restorationrestoration involves more than just a steady hand and a painstaking temperament. it requires a good knowledge of past fashion and a fine instinct for design. the techniques and tools of gilding and restoration have hardly changed for centuries. during the restoration process, we retain the frames' integrity and ornamentation, remaining faithful to the period. when pieces are missing, this requires that we either carve or cast and reattach sections prior to preparing them for regilding and toning to match the original patina.
