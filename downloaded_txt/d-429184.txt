donate today so more kids can take on the world















engaging youth as valued, contributing members of their communities in partnership with caring adults.
4-h is part of university of missouri extension and is publicly supported by county, state and federal governments as well as private resources, both human and financial. 4-h welcomes all missouri youth.
as america’s largest youth development organization, 4-h offers youth, families, and adult volunteers of all ages many ways to engage, grow and serve — through clubs, camps, contests, conferences, special interest groups, in-school and afterschool programs, and more. it’s about young people making new friends and memories while preparing to be future leaders — from both rural and urban areas.
the synergy of effective past and present programs, dedicated volunteers and spirited young people will only continue to manifest our vision of a world in which both young people and adults learn, grow and work together as catalysts for positive change
