	 tennessee raptors reality series!
	 
    


we just partnered with an outstanding local production company that is going to produce and broadcast a new reality series based on the tennessee raptors. filming actually begins today at our coaches meeting and will continue throughout the year at all of our practices, meetings, games and more. the focus of the show is really all about the ups and downs, and challenges of every aspect of our team from the coaches perspective, to the players and cheerleaders. it's a behind the scene's look at local professional football. it will be broadcast regionally through elixir (charter & comcast) and could be picked up nationally. in addition, the series will be available to view via streaming media from our site. this is very exciting and represents yet another way that we are bringing minor league football to the national stage. posted by randy ferrell on 3/11/06 at 9:00 am

	 2006 tryouts
	 
    


i am very pleased with our turn out for the 2006 tryouts. we had over 60 new prospects and former afl players attend. not only was there a large number attending, there was speed, strength and skill everywhere. it was great to see some of our players from 2005 attend, even though it wasn't required. i was also very pleased with the performance of our coaching staff, who lead the group of athletes through each drill. our 2005 team had a lot of talent. the combination of last years performers with the talent that was at our tryouts is going to result in one very exciting football team for 2006. we still have a few questions to answer, but those will be handled by the mini-camp in march. the jammin' raptor girls tryouts were equally succesful with 10 girls making the team out of over 30 that pre-registered. posted by randy ferrell on 3/6/06 at 10:24 pm.

	 momentum
	 
    


where to begin? if i had to sum up the past 10 days in one word, it would be momentum. we all know how crucial momentum is in a ball game, if you have it you can win, if you don't and your opponent does, you better steal it quickly. when you have momentum, giant leaps forward can be acheived. i have watched the miami hurricanes put up 21 points in under 5 minutes on sheer momentum. we have all seen amazing examples of this before. i will defer to coach mitchell to elaborate further on the importance of momentum in a game. the power of momentum is not confined to sports alone, and often impacts our lives in many ways. our organization is currently experiencing dramatic growth due in large part to sheer momentum. it is one month into 2006, and here is a breakdown of all that has happened already... we have added several new employees to our management team. we have already, nearly 80 local athletes interested in playing for the raptors this season. we have 12 highly qualified, pre-registered candidates for the jammin' raptor girls. we forged an exciting partnership with the leading hip hop radio station in the region (jammin' 92.3 & 103.9), to promote the raptors. we have partnered with regional powerhouse elixer group to advertise and broadcast our games to the entire region, live on cable tv. we partnered with a local music/entertainment company to produce our own team rap called "the raptor zone." we have the 2006 coaching and staff uniforms in hand. we have the new 2006 helmet decals in hand. they look very sharp and reflect the new branding see: http://www.tennesseeraptors.com/2006_helmets.html . we will be meeting with ron bliss editor of tricities sports http://www.tricitiessports.com today to discuss launching a partnership with his leading online and print publication. we will be meeting with representatives from wjhl/tricities.com on the 15th to explore a forming a partnership. from a league perspective, the mighty tennessee pioneers have officially joined the afl. the pioneers, in terms of talent and leadership, are one of the country's top teams, and will provide some very serious competition in our league in 2006. as exciting as all of that is, it pales in comparison to the fantastic news that yesterday, i met with a couple of gentlemen, local mavens, who are inspired to assist the raptors with acquiring a stadium to call home. these two local prominant businessmen, will be working closely with raptors management, providing funding and more to rapidly prepare our new home in the tri-cities. stay tuned... posted by randy ferrell on 2/3/06 at 10:00 am

	 prospects, signings and more
	 
    


we are a week or so into player recruiting and jammin' raptor girls promotions... so how is it going so far? well you need only take a look at the signings and prospects areas of our roster to see that we have already received a significant amount interest from area athletes. these numbers do not reflect those that will pre-register over the next 5 weeks, nor does it include those that will just show up on march 4th. i'd say things are going pretty well so far. that said, very soon, we will be launching our recruiting campaign in local print media and on popular local websites, to support our current efforts. on the cheerleading front, we have also received significant interest in the jammin' raptor girls. we are finalizing details on the girl's custom uniforms and they are going to be smokin! there will be 2 different uniforms, one consisting of logo'd cloth boy shorts and an actual cut-off game jersey (similar to the picture), and the other (for games) will be a custom made design with lace up shorts and top. we will be providing the outfits for the girls that make the team. we have also just brought onboard the new jammin' raptor girls choreographer, lori paxton. lori brings many years of teaching cheer and dance and will prepare the girls for the 2006 season. welcome to the team lori! we have also received several outstanding applications staff positions, including one for the statistician position, and another for the media director position. more soon... posted by randy ferrell on 1/23/06 at 10:00 pm

	 new jammin' raptor girls
	 
    


jammin 92.3 & 103.9 has become the official music of the tennessee raptors! jammin and the raptors are launching our partnership with an exciting campaign to build the jammin' raptor girls cheer and dance team. we have gone live with a co-branded site with jammin 92.3 which is located at www.jammin.tennesseeraptors.com . the new co-branded site is also the new cheerleaders section. jammin will be promoting the raptor girls tryouts on march 4th at the boys & girls club of johnson city and will be on hand at the event to assist with judging, and passing out jammin packs to the girls that attend. both organizations feel that hip hop and football go hand in hand and that our new partnership will be fun and rewarding. raptors management is excited about this fantastic new relationship with jammin and looks forward to many opportunities to co-promote our brands in the future. posted by randy ferrell on 1/17/06 at 8:46 pm

	 marching forward
	 
    


this week we rolled out another site upgrade, this time to the staff section. the area was re-organized, separating our coaching staff from our business management staff. the re-organization was done to prepare for, significant growth of our business management team. in addition to the staff divisions, we went live with the all new employment opportunities section. the new jobs section lists current available positions within the tennessee raptors organization, along with their respective job description. all positions will soon be advertised to the tri-cities region, via local newspapers and more. our goal is to grow and strengthen our business management team, by creating specific job opportunities that each address a unique and challenging sector of our business. through job specialization, we will ensure that each unique and important area of our business, receives the attention that it needs in order to contribute to our overall success. most positions are not initially compensated financially, however in lieu of pay, we are offering a seat on the tennessee raptors board of directors to those that both meet our criteria, and commit to the team. board members will have the unique and exciting opportunity to help shape the future of the tennessee raptors and assist us with becoming all that we can be to the many fine residents of northeast tennessee. in less that 24 hours after going live with our jobs section, we brought onboard our new director of corporate sales & sponsorship. we are proud to introduce kris cantu. kris brings years of sales and marketing management experience with him and is an immediate asset to the raptors organization. in addition, it is likely that we have also filled the director of marketing and public relations position, yet another critical addition to our business management team. more on that later. we also rolled out with a large update to our cheerleaders section, providing indepth details regarding our upcoming raptor girls tryouts in march, along with downloadable registration forms. we will be rolling out with a couple more site updates in the coming weeks...  posted by randy ferrell on 1/4/06 at 9:38 pm

melissa and i met with the jcpr today. we greatly enjoyed meeting with mr. alexander, and left feeling assured that the jcpr shares our vision. we have the ok to hold our winter workouts at indian springs, pending sign-off from the school administration regarding the dates and times. we will hopefully have that in hand by the end of next week. with regards to spurrier field, we are continuing to work closely with the jcpr, discussing details and working towards an agreement. if we are able to finalize things with johnson city early enough, then we might be able to hold our 2006 tryouts and mini-camp at spurrier field. this would be ideal, as then we could invite the public to participate at both events. in other news, we just completed and launched a significant upgrade to our promotions section, which includes all new imagery, as well as visual examples of our unique sponsorship opportunities for 2006. while i am on the topic of sponsorships, we are in talks with sprint, gnc, pepsi and many more leading national brands, as well as many outstanding local businesses. we are also communicating with management over at jammin 92.3. they are interested in potentially becoming the official radio station of the tennessee raptors. hip hop is huge, and we feel that their station aligns nicely with our young aggressive brand. very exciting. there is significant interest in our team's sponsorship and partnership opportunities. we look very forward to providing our sponsors and partners with exceptional value, and to an exciting and rewarding year together. posted by randy ferrell on 12/29/05 at 9:07 pm

	 the round table
	 
    


an afl meeting was held yesterday at calhouns on the river in knoxville. the meeting was held to discuss items on the agenda for 2006, and also to vote on the addition of two new potential expansion teams. i am happy to announce that the loudon county colts and the tennessee rattlers were both voted into the league. i had the pleasure of meeting bobby bache' owner/defensive coordinator for the rattlers as well as terri and chris williams, the owners of the loudon county colts. also attending were, bill dudley for the 2005 league champion bluefield barons, greg campbell, league president and owner of the knoxville knights, the afl secretary fred campbell, and melissa ferrell, sidney mitchell, bo wilcox, and myron steffey representing the raptors. representatives for the sumner county express were unable to attend the meeting, but will have another chance to address the league in the coming months. we also received word that the asheville bears are submiting an application in the coming days! so without including any additional expansion teams that may apply beyond this week, we have a total of seven teams in the league. regional interest in the afl should generate an additional expansion team or two. we hope to have around nine or ten teams in the league by start of the practice season in the spring. the meeting was enjoyed by all. everyone enjoyed the comradery and respectfully took shots at each other, as a group of off season rivals will always do. each shared thier own, humble, ahem, predictions for 06, except perhaps mr. dudley, who mostly refrained. i suppose he lets his 10-0 record speak for itself... posted by randy ferrell on 12/18/05 at 8:30 am

	 phew! what a day...
	 
    


yesterday, an article about the raptors was printed in the johnson city press, as well as the kingsport times, and possibly others. we had calls and emails from cheerleaders, prospective players, potential sponsors and just plain ol happy local residents... a big thanks goes to the johnson city press, and more specifically bob robinson, for writing the very nice story about our team. yesterday we received record traffic to the tennesseeraptors.com site. this morning it is starting all over again. it appears that there is significant interest in our team. there were inquiries into our schedule, our tickets, where will we be playing and more. while we are working with the city to make spurrier field the home of the tennessee raptors, we won't know the details of our schedule for some time still. it will likely be late spring before we have that information from the afl. raptors management is working at a break neck pace to keep up with all of this. one thing is certain, and that is that 2006 is going to be one heck of an exciting year!  posted by randy ferrell  on 12/16/05 at 9:00 am

	 and now a word form our sponsors...
	 
    


no seriously, so far  several of the raptors' major corporate sponsors have already come back and  informed management that they would be onboard in the upcoming 2006 season, and  given our success, will in fact, likely be deepening the relationship. i  consider our sponsors to be more than just advertisers, they are indeed, partners in our  success. they share our vision and seek to assist us with achieving it. they  support every aspect of our team, right down to the individual players. they  have been with us from the beginning stages, early adapters, on the cutting  edge... sure, they are benefiting from the rapid growth of our exciting brand,  but we couldn't do it without them. so take some time to learn more about our  fine sponsors. if your a raptors' player or fan, give them  your business, or at least give them a call and thank them. open a bank account!  hungry? order a pizza! get one of those great new wheat roll, grilled chicken  sandwiches. go to your friendly neighborhood bar and grill and order an ice cold  coke! look sharp in some new cleats, while you order yourself some new business  cards, o and hey, get a room! ;) posted by randy ferrell on 12/13/05 at 5:30 am

	 the big move.
	 
    


sorry about the silence. we have been working very  hard to complete our task of re-branding the greeneville raptors to the  tennessee raptors. there is still some work left to be done, however we are far  enough along to at least inform those of you who are not aware. here's the  scoop: management collectively decided that it was in our team's best interest,  to fully take advantage of the territorial rights to the tri-cities region. as  the tennessee raptors, we are now johnson city's, bristol's, kingsport's, and  greeneville's team. we feel that this move will  enable our team to draw fan support from the entire region and assist us with  the growth of our franchise. in addition to the re-branding, the tennessee  raptors are moving the team to johnson city. we are communicating with city  officials in a sincere effort to secure steve spurrier field as the raptors' new  home. we feel that by relocating our team to johnson city, we will be in a more  centralized location to the entire tri-cities region. this positions the  raptors' games within a 30 minute drive of nearly everyone in the tri-cities  area, including greeneville. the move will provide the tri-cities area residents  with close, affordable, quality family sports entertainment. we feel that this  move is a very natural next step for our franchise and keeps us firmly on track  towards realizing our ultimate goal of becoming northeast tennessee's  professional football team. more to come... posted by randy ferrell on 12/9/05 at 9:25 am

	 the off season...
	 
    


ahhh the   off season, time to relax, sit back and reminisce  about the past year... not! the "off season" whatever that means, actually means, it's time to focus on business. time to strengthen the infrastructure,  make adjustments, form new alliances, strengthen existing ones. time to examine where you've been and refocus on where you are going. and just where is that? well, we have a long way to go to become all that we can be to northeast tennessee. this area needs more quality family sports entertainment. more to do on a fall weekend evening. what better than watching our own talented athletes, from our area high schools and colleges, proudly represent, on the gridiron, live. ok yes, occasionally an exceptional athlete from our area catches a break and goes on to play ncaa or even nfl football. that said, many more choose to stay in this area, start careers and build families. this provides our region with a rich pool of very talented football players, many of which, we watched on friday nights at the local high school. sure we have tennessee pride and we should. there's the titans and of course ut, but how about our area? absolutely! we have great pride for our region! so then, when a team of athletes from other proud cities like knoxville, bluefield or asheville invades the tri-cites, are we going to pull for our team? you bet. the raptors have several players that should be playing on sundays, including sanchez releford (volunteer), jeremy graves (dobyns-bennett) and octavious latimore (carson-newman) to name a few. they just didn't catch a break. yet. having the opportunity to watch them do their thing, live, on the field, is fabulous. having that opportunity for a ticket price of 10 bucks, and without having to drive for hours, is simply amazing. simply put, a lot of area sports fans are missing out, and we aim to change that. posted by randy ferrell on 12/4/05 at 8:51 am

	 the new minor league football
	 
    


minor league football has been in ne tennessee for some time now. teams have sprung up here and there only to fade away not long after. the plight of minor league football in this area has made it very difficult for emerging teams to develop a significant following. however, what has been occurring is a very natural process. in nature, many seeds reach soil, but precious few germinate to become saplings, and even fewer go on to become mighty trees. it is the way of things, not only in nature, but in business, and it so it seams, in football... natural selection it is dubbed. only the strongest will survive. the cycle of emergence and failure repeated over and over... enter a new breed of minor league football teams. teams with vision, business savvy and funding. teams with vital adaptations that ensure survival and in fact proliferation! take for example the bluefield barons. a brand new team on the scene. on their very first game, the barons packed over 6,000 fans into mitchell stadium. i feel that their remarkable success is due to the exceptional leadership skills of the barons' staff headed up by bill dudley. of course the availability of mitchell stadium played a key roll, but none the less, it was the flawless execution of mr. dudley's business plan, that delivered. look out world, minor league football is coming out. professional football is no longer limited to major cities like new york or miami. smaller, proud, thriving communities like ours, now have football teams too... posted by randy ferrell on 11/29/05 at 5:19 pm

the mighty barons have fallen to the virginia hornets in the 2nd round of the efa playoffs. the undefeated streak ended with a 0 - 7 loss at the hornets' home field. as usual, there appears to have been controversial officiating, resulting in two barons touchdowns being called back. hmmm, well, gotta hand it to bill dudley, as he took the loss in stride and simply acknowledged that they finally ran into a team that was bigger and stronger than they were (scary thought). bill and his crew are a class act, no doubt about it, and i look forward to meeting them again in 2006... posted by randy ferrell on 11/14/05 at 9:44 am

	 practice saturday at noon!
	 
    


and be prepared to run... is that what we said? i am pretty sure that we said, "party, and be prepared to eat!" so then, how is it that we had around 20 people (players, coaches and family) attend the party? the lure of free hamburgers, hotdogs, chips, cake, college football and comradery with our team mates, most of which we won't see again till spring, simply wasn't enough, i suppose. it is hard to hide my disappointment. through discussions with other team owners, and from my own experience, this is, from what i can see, one of the most common, and frustrating situations in the world of minor league football. words like "team" and "family" are used frequently, but the depth of the words, often doesn't extend beyond game day. in other words, on game day, you can expect 99% of your roster to be on the field, however actual participation at other team events (practices, fund raisers, yes even parties) often sees less than 20% of your roster's attendance. i know, i know... there's the usual, i had to work, no gas, my socks have holes, but this is about politics baby, if you have other obligations, or stuff to do, just show up for 15 minutes, shake some hands, say some "can't wait till 06's" etc., and cut out. i could go on for hours. grrrrr. but i'll leave it right there. for those of you that attended, thank you very much. we all managed to woof down 40 hamburgers and 30 hotdogs! we all enjoyed your company. i enjoyed surprising you with the 2005 season mvp awards. we gave out an offensive, defensive and overall mvp award. ironically, the players that won the awards all attended the party, go figure... pictures from the party are posted in the photos section of the site. posted by randy ferrell on 11/13/05 at 9:14 am

	 build it and they will come...
	 
    


what an exciting season it was. the 2005 season will always be special to me, as not only was it our actual first year as the raptors, but it was just so much fun. looking back, we all had such a great time. sure the losses were tough, but hey that's football, or for that matter any sport. you take your losses, and learn what you can from them, and move on. winning our season opener against the knights was incredible. what an evening that was. through out the season, each game was filled with emotions of virtually every kind. if there is one word that described each game, that word was entertaining. there were crushing hits, long passes for touch downs, long kick off returns, great runs, shoe string catches, sacks, fumbles, pick offs, and blocked field goals. the games were intense, and filled with emotion, kind of a like a hybrid between college and pro. an evening of incredibly exciting, live sports entertainment, and all for only the cost of a pizza! so where were the fans? greeneville, tn has roughly the same size population as bluefield, wv. there were nearly 6,000 fans at the barons vs. raptors game, but only 200 at the raptors vs. barons game. so, what gives? trust me when i tell you that as the owner of the greeneville raptors, i have done a great deal of deep thinking about this quandary. both teams are nearly identical in everyway, everyway except one, and that is mitchell stadium. the barons enjoy the opportunity to play all of their home games in a 10,000 seating capacity, very nice stadium. barons' fans get to enjoy the real experience of minor league football at it's best. in sharp contrast, raptors fans have not had the opportunity to enjoy the full experience of the game, because the setting simply isn't as exciting, as a larger stadium offers. even watching the titans play the dolphins, wouldn't be the same experience at a 500 seating field that the local high school team plays at. now don't get me wrong, we are thankful for the opportunity to play period, the schools in greeneville have been very helpful and we are very grateful, i am merely making a valid point from the fans point of view. even the allure of watching and supporting local home town hero's doing battle on the grid iron, isn't enough to draw them out in droves. so, all of that said, one of our top priorities, as the leadership of this organization, is to acquire a stadium, a real home for the raptors. we have worked very hard to build a top quality franchise, and put a quality product on the field. our players are very talented and they look sharp! we have a lot of work to do yet, but i believe we have succeeded in building one of minor league football's top brands. in 2006, we will be communicating with greeneville high, and if all goes well, hopefully, our fans will be able to enjoy watching the raptors in one of the nicest high school football stadiums in northeast tn. greeneville high will be great. however, in order for the raptors to truly become all that they can be to the city of greeneville and it's fine residents, we need a home field, that is worthy of their presence. our goal remains, to play our 2007 season in our own 5,000+ seating stadium. we are communicating with the city and county and are working hard to make this a reality. stay tuned.posted by randy ferrell on 11/10/05 at 11:48 am

	 got kicker?
	 
    


how bout those barons! you know, it looks like the afl bluefield barons could very well play in, and win, the efa national championship! they have to win a couple more very big games, but hey, hats of to the players, coaches, and staff for nothing less than a perfect season so far. even more remarkable, is the fact that 2005 is the barons' very first year as a team. we all know that in 2004 the knights went deep into the efa playoffs, and now the barons are doing their thing, representing the afl. i think maybe, the efa, just might begin to respect our little "renegade league" for the powerful, quality teams that the afl produces. what is exciting, is that within the afl, each of us know that we gave each other a tough battle. often the difference between a win or a loss, really was all about who could kick a field goal and who couldn't. a great example, of the fierce competition in this league, is our last home game against the barons on september 24th. by mid game, we know and the barons would have to admit, that we had them on the ropes. defensively, we had shut them down and we were moving the ball efficiently. a big punt return by chez, set us up for an opportunity to go up on the barons and maybe, just maybe get in their heads enough to dominate the rest of the game. unfortunately, a few bad play calls (trying to run up the middle, on the barons), a defended fade to the corner of the end zone, and finally, no kicker and a missed 2 point conversion, swung the momentum back in favor of the barons, and we really didn't recover from there. of course those that were there that night, will also have to admit that, that evening the raptors were the victims of the worst officiated game in the history of minor league football. consider the 2nd game against the knights in knoxville. we were in the red zone at least 6 times, 2 of those times, we scored touchdowns, but no kicker meant no extra points and no field goals. if we had, had the ability to kick field goals, we would have very likely won that game. and finally, and perhaps most ironically, the afl championship game came down to the knights inability to kick a 15 yard field goal to win...posted by randy ferrell on 11/7/05 at 10:45 pm

	 why we do it.
	 
    


in the previous post, i made the statement that we love this sport. but why? for those not playing the game, this is a very good question. why do we play minor league football? do we make a lot of money? no. in fact, playing often takes time away from our work, which costs us money. participation at practices and games means time away from our families. we also risk serious injury every time we step onto the field. do we do it for the glory? well, some maybe, but given that our games are in front of a small hometown crowd, the actual glory achieved is somewhat muted. indeed some of us play with hopes of getting scouted and moving on to arena or the league, but only a few of us are young enough, and at a skill level that makes that a real possibility. i certainly can't speak for all of us who play the game at this level. i can though, at least say why i do it. i play the great sport of minor league football for many reasons. for one, i play simply because i can. sure i am 38 years old, but i have been working out, eating right and staying in shape, ever since i was in my teens. in short, i am strong enough, and fast enough to play at this level, so i do. also, playing ball ads another dimension to who i am as a person, i am a husband, a father, a son, an executive, an entrepreneur and a football player. i greatly enjoy the comradery with my team mates and the coaching staff. i enjoy the additional sense of purpose and contribution. i also of course, get a great rush from the battle that ensues with each snap of the ball, whether i am engaging a big defensive end, or running a pass route, each play is akin to a sky dive, one after another, after another. it is exhilarating. as well, i suppose on some level, i feel a need, a primal urge for physical competition, one that win or lose, is satisfied by doing battle on the field... posted by randy ferrell on 11/4/2005 at 5:04 pm

	 we ain't playin tennis!
	 
    


...to quote a quite humorous comment that was made by one of our more physical and animated players during a late season game. he had just layed a major (but clean) hit on one of the opposing team's players, who needed some help getting up and off the field. i recall this as i sit here typing with a broken left thumb, seriously sprained (and wrapped) right wrist, and yet another separated rib. i have been thinking a lot about the many facets of the 2005 season, and one thing that i can say for sure, is that it was definitely a season plagued with injuries. we had twisted ankles, sprained ankles, separated shoulders, torn ligaments, turf toe, broken fingers, busted lips (ahem), pulled muscles, concussions, unconsciousness and even a broken femur. all of this happened in spite of being completely covered in pads, wrap and protective gear. no, we ain't playin tennis, we are playin one of the most physically challenging, and brutal sports in the world, and we love it!posted by randy ferrell on 11/4/2005 at 5:04 pm

all together, the knights and raptors lost 5 straight games this season to the bluefield barons. a brand new team enters the afl and steam rolls through it... pain. the barons are big, they're skilled, and they are for real. none of us like it, and one thing for sure is, that some new rivalries have definitely been created. that said, it is time now, to come together and support the league. the barons are a shining new part of the afl, and are an excellent representative of the quality franchises that we are building in this area. the barons are the 2005 afl champions and without question, deserve to be. i for one, would very much like to see them go all the way and win the efa national championship. so with bitterness put aside, i ask all afl players, coaches and fans, to join me in saying, take it to em barons!posted by randy ferrell on 11/3/05 at 8:46 am
