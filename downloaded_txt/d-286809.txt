lewis dot structures of covalent compounds




by dr. miriam douglass, dr. martin mcclinton




 in this interactive and animated object, students distribute the valence electrons in simple covalent molecules with one central atom. six rules are followed to show the bonding and nonbonding electrons in lewis dot structures. the process is well illustrated with eight worked examples and two interactive practice problems.
