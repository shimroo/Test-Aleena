          parker & otis at the nasher museum!        

“well, first of all, we love jennings. with her eye and the work that she’s done with stores in the community, it’s going to be, for the first time, really a reflection of our identity as a museum, because she understands it. and even the way it looks as a space – not to mention the merchandise – it just changes things dramatically. we’re super excited.” – nasher museum director trevor schoonmaker in the summer issue of durham magazine.
