as of february 2015, a regular visitor to the mesa web site (if such a person exists) would have noticed that this site hasn't been updated in recent months. there are two reasons for this.
firstly, mesa is in a period of transition. after 30 years serving the needs of marine educators in the australasian region, the mesa council took the strategic step of uniting with the australian association for environmental education (aaee). mesa and aaee have always been closely affiliated sharing similar aims so this is seen as a logical step. in effect, mesa has now morphed into the aaee marine & coastal special interest group. 
all former mesa members and supporters are now encouraged to join aaee and make an active contribution to the aaee marine & coastal special interest group. go to www.aaee.org.au and follow the links to "join us".
secondly, after a prolonged illness our web manager (peter biro) passed away suddenly on september 1st, 2014. peter created the first mesa web site as part of seaweek in 1996 and has been the voluntary mesa web manager ever since. to honour peter's contribution it is our intention to keep this web site and the wealth of resources it contains active for as long as we can. to access these resources go to seaweek, site resources and international news in the navigation bar above. we also plan to add a new section highlighting mesa history soon.












peter biro (1951 - 2014)
the following tributes reflect peter biro's contribution to mesa over those years.
"his contributions here (the mesa web site) and to supporting seaweek over decades have helped bring the sea and its magic into thousands of peoples lives and we are all the richer for his efforts." (mark rodrigue - past mesa president)
"peter diligently presided over our website and it was only with his continued passion for the site that it is what it is today. peter crafted every page, added every image and tirelessly maintained it. he will be remembered and the site is his legacy." (angela colliver - past mesa president)
"peter will always be an 'unsung hero' to me for marine education and life, in general. he has played a huge role in making a difference for our next generation." (tim hoile - past mesa president)
"peter was my friend. how many hours did he give to the marine education society's website over all those years? i have no idea. however, the website gave aussies a public face to show the world that we were determined to make a difference." (jody plecas - past mesa public officer)














seaweek is a celebration of the uniqueness of our "ocean planet"
seaweek was a national initiative conducted annually by mesa since 1988. the aim of seaweek has always been to "celebrate the sea" and, more specifically, to focus community awareness, provide information and encourage an appreciation of our marine and coastal environments. members of the aaee marine & coastal sig will now coordinate seaweek.


for many years seaweek was celebrated in march. however, in 2015 seaweek will be held in the second week of september (september 5th to 13th).
each year a different theme is highlighted during seaweek. the theme for seaweek 2015 will be "celebrating seaweek". this theme will enable you to look back at past seaweek themes and choose your favourite or simply celebrate 27 years of seaweek.
we also have some exciting plans for seaweek 2016 and beyond. stay tuned for further announcements.







 






seaweek 2014 - sustainable seas and sustainable aquaculture
the theme for seaweek 2014 is sustainable seas. the theme provides a focus for students in schools and for communities to inform and inspire them about the diversity of our  marine and coastal environments and how, through good management and individual action, we can all contribute towards the sustainability of these environments. there is a subtheme related to aquaclture as well.go to our events page to find out what is on!

aaee marine & coastal special interest group


 

kate keary created the aaee marine & coastal special interest group (sig). the sig already has its own facebook group as well as a mailing list for members to share conversations, ideas and resources. you donât have to be a member of the aaee to join the sig, however the member benefits of this association are exceptional. we would recommend anyone interested or working in environmental education join the aaee.

the link to this facebook group is https://www.facebook.com/groups/510101945695277/
to join the mailing list, or if you have any questions or queries about the information above, please contact kate at kate@beachteach.com.au








 




mesa on facebook  
the link to the facebook page is https://www.facebook.com/pages/marine-education-society-of-australasia/146351192098470?sk=wall
facebook is a fantastic tool. although mesa has now morphed into the aaee marine & coastal sig, the mesa facebook page will continue as a forum for people working or interested in marine education. it provides opportunities to link with others and throw ideas around. kate keary maintains and regularly checks the page, posting suggestions and providing info and interesting links.
