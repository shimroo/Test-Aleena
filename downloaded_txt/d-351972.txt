	 "correction inevitable, could be a doozie"
    


the australian has a report out with more details of the speech by fed honcho jack guynn. "he was especially concerned about reports of speculators buying homes and condos 'just to flip them for a quick profit' and that banks and other financers are taking big risks in the area.""'it seems like every week brings new stories about aggressive financing arrangements that encourage and enable such real estate transactions,' guynn said.""new data overnight showed sales of new us homes edged up 0.2 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million, an all-time record.""diane swonk, chief economist at mesirow financial, said, 'the concern is the further we go, the more risk we run of a significant long-term correction."

	 buyers, builders, lenders may get "burned"
    


atlanta federal reserve bank president jack guynn added to the housing bubble debate with these comments. "'there are some local markets, especially in coastal florida, where i've heard stories for more than a year about behavior that's got to be characterized as nothing other than speculation,' guynn said it response to questions after his speech." "'it makes me very uncomfortable. some buyers, some builders, some lenders are going to get burned, could very likely get burned, in some of those local markets,' he said.""the u.s. federal reserve is not yet done raising interest rates, but the central bank will watch economic data closely in an uncertain time for monetary policy. 'given the current outlook for the economy, my personal view is that we've not yet reached a neutral policy stance,' guynn noted."

	 spanish mortgage debt up 25% in one year
    


in spain, the re boom has pushed the country to the brink. "household debt in spain surpassed disposable income for the first time last year, posing risks for the stability of the financial system, the bank of spain said monday.""the increase in indebtedness of spanish households is largely the result of much bigger mortgages to acquire the family home due to an ongoing property boom in which house prices have risen about 150 percent since 1997.""according to figures from the spanish mortgage association (ahe), total outstanding mortgage loans at the end of march stood at a new record of €615.132 billion, a rise of 24.5 percent from a year earlier."
