about holly lake ranch

holly lake ranch is a private, gated, hoa-managed community established in 1971. our community is nestled in the piney woods of northeast texas boasting many amenities for our residents and providing 24-hour on-site security services from the holly lake ranch public safety department. one of our most prized amenities is our 18-hole leon howard-designed golf course complete with putting green, driving range, and pro shop. additionally, holly lake ranch has five private lakes ranging in size from a couple hundred acres to just a few acres. the unique attributes of each lake make them individually suited to a variety of activities including fishing, swimming, skiing, and recreational boating. many other amenities are available for our residents to enjoy, such as tennis and pickleball courts, nature trails, a gun range, a fitness center, swimming pools, a restaurant, a private airport, and many more. a multitude of clubs and groups are available for our residents to join. see the clubs, groups and associations page for more information.
holly lake ranch is designed to blend with the natural environment and to protect the abundance of foliage and wildlife. just a short drive from the dfw metroplex, this is a perfect place to relax and enjoy the peace of northeast texas. all properties are privately owned and there are often homes and homesites available for sale. since holly lake ranch is a gated community, those interested in viewing available properties should arrange a tour with a local real estate agent.
