another challenging regular season schedule for the dreadnaughtslakeland high school captured its 9th state football title in 2023. after graduating 31 seniors it is going to be an “all-hands-on-deck” mentality for the dreadnaughts this season. the saying goes, “a calm sea never made for a skillful sailor” is very true this year. facing one of the most difficult schedules in the state, head coach marvin frazier is looking for key players to step up and assume leadership roles on this year’s 2024 lhs squad.

welcome dreadnaughts

dear dreadnaught faithful:
i don’t think the last 2 seasons could have been more exciting -back-to-back state championships!  coach marvin frazier is determined to continue the tradition of excellence with the lakeland football program.  as we embark on what will be a challenging schedule for our 2024 campaign, i wanted to highlight a few things that our program is most proud of, and without your support, we couldn’t do it:

we had 17 players from last year’s squad sign college football scholarships to help realize the dream of obtaining a college degree.
we updated all our stadium signage to include our 2023 florida 4s state championship, that makes 9 if you are counting.
our 2024 schedule includes powerhouse programs: miami central, miami booker t. washington and lake mary.
thanks to our teachers and coaches we had 22 student athletes from last year’s team finish with a gpa of 3.3 or higher.

the friday night experience at bryant stadium is unlike any program in the state of florida and we couldn’t do it without our 100+ volunteers who make it possible. from the cheerleaders and anchorettes, helmet cart, rotc-runway to victory, firing of the cannon, the bell and so much more, our students, fans, players and coaches appreciate all that makes this place so special.  thank you for your support of our storied football program and school.
i look forward to seeing you on friday nights at bryant!
jil bevis, president
