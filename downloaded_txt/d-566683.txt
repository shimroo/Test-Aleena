						"frankly, i think it’s the best purchase we’ve ever made.”					


—meredith w, np49 owner 






						"the only reason we traded our 42 in was that we needed a larger second stateroom and second head and shower. and then, we got the np49. more than anything we appreciate that trevor brice is honest, trustworthy and stands behind his product.”					


—george larson 






						"throughout my experience, i’ve been most impressed with the references from older np boat owners and the fantastic service that i have received from north pacific on both of my trawlers.”					


—w. corbin 






						"following an extensive search of numerous trawlers, the np 49 fulfilled our needs and requirements and was the best of the vessels we considered. we would highly recommend the north pacific yacht and have found it to provide exceptional live-aboard experience. the service support after the sale has been exceptional as well.”					


—nancy and tom rea, np 49 "meanders", northern michigan 






						"i have recently been on a number of large yachts, costing up to $15,000,000, and have not found that attention to detail.”					


—roger mcaffee, sea magazine/pacific yachting contributor
