institute of cognitive and brain sciences






 




















the institute of cognitive and brain sciences (icbs) supports research exploring the study of the mind and the biological basis of behavior and mental function. founded as the institute for cognitive studies in 1984, icbs adopted its current name in 2000 in recognition of the emergence of cognitive neuroscience as a field for the bi-directional study of mind-brain relationships.
institute members come from a number of departments on campus, including psychology, linguistics, electrical engineering and computer sciences, vision science, education, anthropology, philosophy, music, and the helen wills neuroscience institute. the intersection of researchers from these different disciplines has led to new research paradigms and methodologies to address classic questions.
