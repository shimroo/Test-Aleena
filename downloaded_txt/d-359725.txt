mind, privacy & freedom. 
the challenge of crime in a free
society
is a book several decades old, but
a timeless articulation of the problem. we need to be concerned with reducing crime and
violence, including our epidemic of corporate crime. but 'getting tough' only on street crime
by building prisons is an ineffective, even counterproductive,
way to reduce violence - like mopping the floor while
the tub overflows; it endangers individual liberties (especially of
minority citizens), takes money from crime prevention programs and fuels a
criminal justice-industrial complex.
