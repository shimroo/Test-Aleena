elijah 
              the tishbite
 by w.w. fereday
 "why did god employ elijah? his flaming 
              zeal for the glory of god, and his simple-hearted faith in his word 
              and in his power is the answer." 
 self esteem
 by w.j. prost
 the essence of true christianity is not 
              to have either high or low thoughts of self, but rather not to be 
              thinking about self at all. for to me to live is christ.

a divine movement
"the 
              same night"


a. j. p. 

              he goes out into the night, and is dragged through scene after scene 
              of revolting cruelty and high-handed injustice, till at length the 
              darkness closes around that central cross, and all god's judgment 
              upon sin is dealt out upon him. 
            "holy 
              brethren" 

c. h. mackintosh 
              but let us inquire on what does the apostle ground the title of 
              "holy brethren?" it is of all possible importance to 
              be clear as to this. 
            the 
              passover and the lords supper 
by l. m. grant

"the breaking of bread is not individual, 
              though individual exercise of soul is to bring us there, and is 
              to be maintained there also. but "the cup of blessing which we bless, 
              is it not the communion (or fellowship) of the blood of christ? 
              the bread which we break, is it not the communion (or fellowship) 
              of the body of christ? for we being many are one bread, one body: 
              for we are all partakers of that one bread" (1 cor. 10:16-17). "

the parable of the

                even as the tree was telling us of its master, we looked round, 
                and lo! the master himself stood there. he was looking with love 
                and longing on the tree, and in his hand he held a sharp axe. 
                "i have need of thee," he said. "art thou willing to give thyself 
                to me?"

david dunlap
"amid all the confusion, terror, 
                      and conflict that rages today, our god remains a refuge 
                      of grace and strength. he stoops down to us in our need 
                      and misery to lift us up. then, through acts of omnipotence 
                      and power, he makes known to men that the sovereign god 
                      of the universe is still on the throne."
our 
                      intercessory place  

john bloore 
"now, as to our attitude toward the 
                      present struggle: it must not be nationalistic, or we step 
                      out of our true place. to be those of whom it is said, "ye 
                      are not of the world," and yet take a place of partisanship 

                      in the world's struggle, is to lose our distinctive character 
                      and fail to fill our proper place."
