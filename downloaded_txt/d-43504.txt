division of basic research


the division of basic research (dbr) explores fundamental scientific questions relevant to medicine and anesthesiology.
our research encompasses neurobiology, cell biology, and pharmacology with ongoing projects centered around the following areas: understanding mechanisms of hypoxic and immune-mediated cell death, investigating general anesthetic mechanisms, exploring ion channel function, identifying biomarkers of organ injury, uncovering novel intracellular signaling pathways, and studying the neurobiology of stress and addiction.
our team
the division is led by jose moron-concepcion, phd, the henry e. mallinckrodt professor of anesthesiology, whose laboratory focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying opioid addiction and the intersection with pain. learn more about our team and labs below.
for general research inquiries, please contact the research administrative team.

pi labs
the dbr is located within both the neuroscience building and the clinical sciences research building on the washington university medical campus. principal investigators are members of the division of biological and biomedical sciences at washu medicine and a number of graduate students have completed their thesis work in dbr labs.
