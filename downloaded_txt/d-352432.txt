earthquake tips
when it comes to earthquake, we've been there, done that, now serving 86 tips in 9 categories ranging from after to survival.











											can scientists predict earthquakes?
									 	

earthquake prediction
scientists can not accurately predict when earthquakes will happen. progress in recent decades, however, allows them to predict the probability of a quake occurring on a particular fault line. 
scientists gather data concerning activity on fault lines in recent history and can now come up with a prediction of a quake happening within the next few decades. while that doesn't seem to mean a lot when it comes to saving lives, it does allow the "target areas" to at least be prepared with education about dealing with the steps to take when the quake actually hits.

											how do i build an earthquake model?
									 	

building models
there are two ways of constructing earthquake models. one is commonly used by scientists - a computer generated 3d model. these normally require expensive software and a good grasp of computer lingo. the other is a live scale model. the easiest ones to construct are built from springs and ball bearings. a flat piece of plywood is anchored to 4 springs in each corner. the springs are then anchored to a fixed platform. from here, structures, buildings, and mountains composed of pebbles are placed on the plywood. 
for example, a group of university students built a similar model, but included 3 walls. they attached pictures to the walls, a computer and desk, kitchen table and chairs, a bed, and a ceiling light. 4 people stood behind each corner of the room and pushed in an x manner. the harder they pushed the greater the simulated magnitude was. they simulated a 7.5 magnitude to test new anchor brackets used to secure household objects. 
this is just one of the examples used for quake models. located in the links section of this site will be a link to the usgs where there is a detailed article on another way of constructing quake models.

											what is plate tectonics?
									 	

tectonic plates
this is a theory that unifies many the characteristics and features of continental drift. this theory holds that the lithospere is divided into about 7 major plates with (to the best of our knowledge) 12 smaller ones roughly 60 miles thick, which rest on a soft layer called the asthenosphere. the 25 mile thick continents are embedded within some of these plates, the rest are along the ocean floor.what moves them is still unknown.

jan 14, 2001 - new zealand
the institute of geological and nuclear sciences, victoria university of wellington, reported a 3.4 earthquake at 6:53 am. it was 10 km east of wellington.two other quakes were recorded the day before, one in southern california and a significant quake in mexico.

											why does new zealand have earthquakes?
									 	

new zealand
this was a question from a viewer: why does new zealand have earthquakes?a: australia and the pacific meet along the alpine fault, and the eastern south island is colliding and sliding southwards (and uplifting the southern alps in the process).new zealand straddles the boundary of two tectonic plates, the pacific plate and the australia plate, which move approximately 40 millimeters per year. this movement has been directly linked to volcanic and earthquake activity.trimble gps receivers are used to measure the movement.

											do earthquakes cause volcanoes?
									 	

volcanoes
earthquakes do not cause volcanic activity. to that is different earth processes are responsible for volcanoes. earthquakes may occur in an area before, during, and after a volcanic eruption, but they are the result of the active forces connected with the eruption, not the cause of volcanic activity.
