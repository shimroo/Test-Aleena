t.f. chicago, il“the diamond headache clinic has provided me with superior care for the last 45 years. they have been my guiding light throughout my entire adult life. their focus has always been on the whole body, not just the head. dr. seymour first told me that you will never get better by just taking a pill. they offer acupuncture biofeedback and other alternative treatments along with the standard medical techniques. their hospital clinic is one-of-a-kind. it provides specialized one on one care and treatments. and it is quite beautiful. the diamond clinic will always be my first choice.”
