cathy's concepts is "racing for the cure!"





hello, everyone! cathy's concepts is currently helping fight for a cause so many people have been, currently are and will be affected by... breast cancer. it currently affects one in seven women in the united states and is the second leading cause of cancer death (right behind lung cancer.) when i read this, i was shocked. it seems that the number just keeps heading up and up with no means of stopping. cathy's concepts for many years has offered products that donate a portion of the proceeds to helping fight this deadly disease, but there can always be more to be done. that's why we're "racing for the cure" this april put on by the susan g. komen breast cancer foundation.i encourage you all to check out our homepage, but i would also like to encourage you more to start a team of your own in a city near you! this is a great cause and a lot of fun. i hope to see many of you out there!for more facts about breast cancer and your risks, feel free to visit the the national cancer institute.

love is in the air…





nothing like a romantic holiday to bring out the warmth of springtime even in the coldest of months… that’s right, valentine’s day is here again!  now see, i have always been a fan of the holiday that is all about love.  even though some may argue it is more about commercialism, i still think it is completely fantastic.  some of my friends tend to waver back and forth depending on whether or not that particular year has blessed them with a valentine.  i, however, like to go with the old adage, “all you need is love.”  and it doesn’t always have to be the love you share with a significant other.  i like to celebrate all the love that has been brought into my life.  my family… my friends… those loves are all unwavering, and they should be celebrated the most!  that is why, no matter if you’re single, dating, engaged or married, it is always nice to show appreciation for all the people you love!check out some of our personalized gifts for all the women and men that you love on your list.  some of my personal favorites are the friendship vase, drinking glass set, hanging cosmetic case and two tone cufflinks.  let me know what you think about celebrating valentine’s day!  it’s always a joy to hear from all of you! thanks and be sure to make your day as fabulous as you!cathy
