definitely a great trip full of stunningly beautiful rides, challenging climbs, great hotels, traffic-free roads. overall we had good weather. it exceeded all my expectations and the landscape is amazing. impressive staff support which in my view is the best in the business. this is my 10th trip with thomson bike tours and they have delivered nothing more than excellent experiences every time. definitely a must do cycling trip!

the ruta negra was the most challenging and rewarding 14 days of cycling. to ride and see all the iconic mountains in italian cycling was just surreal and breathtaking. i am now full of cycling memories which will hopefully carry me through to my next thomson tour. riding at home will never be the same again !!

thomson tours and le tour de france go hand-in-hand as the best of partners to create a once-in-a-lifetime (or maybe more if i'm lucky!) experience for amateurs and avid 'couch peleton' members like me! what a privilege to be a part of such a special event in such a fabulous way, seeing the country and feeling the excitement first-hand. thank-you so much for your wonderful hospitality!
