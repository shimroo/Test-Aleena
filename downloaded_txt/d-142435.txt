1880's cabinet photo, who is dick merrill?
maybe a better question is, how are these gentlemen connected to dick merrill.  dick merrill's name is written on the back in pencil (?).  i checked the 1880 federal census for dade county and find dick merrill at the ripe old age of 9.the information reads:1880 federal census, dade county, missouri,center township, dwelling 51:merrill, harry 44 *# ny ?? vt harriet b. 24 w mo tn vt richard h. 9 son mo ny mo john 6 son mo ny mo annie 4 dau mo ny mo cleavland, bell 18 #*# ?? ?? ?? #* attorney #*# cook (transcribed and published by the dade county missouri historical soceity, april 1975, p. 61)   they are the only merrill's listed. the photo was taken at stephenson's photo studio in greenfield.   if you have any information about this photo or these men let me know.  also, the seller of the card stated in the description that is is an 1880's photo but i still need to research stephenson's photo studio to see when they were in business. i would like to dedicate this web site to my brother, james.
