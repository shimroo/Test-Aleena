welcome to chuck's sports cards and collectibles

here at chuck's sports cards i offer a wide range of sports cards team sets for everyone from the beginning collector to the more advanced.  you can find sports cards here for all your favorite professional teams (mlb, nfl, nba, nhl and the mls) that can range from the 1950's through today depending on the sport.  i have been online since 2003 and pride myself in not only providing you with fantastic cards, but fantastic service as well!

 in addition to the team sets, i also offer team lots, team gift sets, graded cards, sets and links to supplies for your hobby needs! more items always on the way or being restocked, so stop back often! plus shortly i will be expanding the site to include comic books & cards as well as some dungeons and dragons items too!
the site is filled with affordable prices for every one looking to build their collections or get a nice gift for birthdays, holidays, etc. many team sets are available under $10 each and the prices i have for vintage or hard to get team sets are very competitive with other card dealers. plus if your order is over $100* (domestic shipping only), shipping and inusrance is free!  i also offer 14 day returns, so feel free to order with confidence.

note:  the team set links are changed in order to meet the seo standards of google, bing and yahoo search engines.  there will be temporary redirect links from the old to the new pages.  please update your saved links as the changes are made.
