where is the oz report?

over on facebook

almost all the oz report content has moved to the oz report group on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/317958425841572. a couple of reasons for this. one is that much of the content that i used to curate (wisely collect and publish) now comes from facebook instead of via email or private message. second, it is expensive to host and maintain a web site. i know that you have been willing to pay for it, but it just doesn't make that much sense when it can be done without that expense. this means that gerry (scare) doesn't get the yearly flood of income in march, but i assume that his technical skills are valuable else where.
gerry has appreciated the support from the oz report readers and will make sure that the oz report web site is still operating even if i don't update it.discuss "where is the oz report?" at the oz report forum   link»

«sander van schaik» writes:
after sending out an official letter from the dutch nac, the knvvl to the civl asking to reinstate the possibility to get a new women world champion, this was the reply after their meeting:
“because we cannot find organisers for a dedicated women's hang gliding world championship, the next worlds that takes part this summer in north macedonia will have, for each nation, 2 spots reserved for women. the eligibility criteria will be the same as for the men, and also the task to fly. if we have at least 8 women from 4 nations, they will be ranked separately so we have a women's world champion. if not, they will just be ranked in the overall category.”
“men or women, team leaders will be free to choose anyone to be part of the team (6 pilots maximum).”discuss "2023 women's world hang gliding championship" at the oz report forum   link»
