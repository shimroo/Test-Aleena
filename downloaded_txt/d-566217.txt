welcome to garden state german shepherd rescuegarden state german shepherd rescue (gsgsr) is a foster based rescue relying solely on volunteers opening their homes and their hearts to  these unwanted german shepherd dogs (gsd). most of our dogs come from other rescues, pounds or shelters and were facing euthanasia due to  overcrowding.once a gsd enters our program, they receive all necessary medical attention, ranging from updating vaccinations to intensive surgical care,  if necessary, and everything in between. we always do what is best for  the dog in our care and get them healthy before adopting them out to  their new home.we also provide an owner referral service where gsgsr works with the current owner to provide a new, loving home for their gsd.
