special links -- a collection


 .     





 .   tucker carlson videos on twitter
covid-19
 .  "tucker rips open the curtain on allegedly 'safe and effective' covid vaccine and death rate."
 .  "thousands of u.s. doctors pedaled covid jabs for cash bonuses making thousands of dollars daily while infecting millions of people with clotting spike proteins."

 .  "the covid-19 vaccination massacre."
 .  "joe rogan interviews dr. robert malone."
 .  "remdesivir 'disastrous' as covid treatment, but government pays hospitals to use it."
january 6th protest
 .  "j6 hysteria is how media and other democrats are avoiding accountability for their rigging of the 2020 election."
 .  "meet ray epps: the fed-protected provocateur who appears to have led the very first 1/6 attack on the u.s. capitol."  the u.s. government is lying to us.  it seems clear the january 6 protest was orchestrated by democrats to demonize republicans, and particularly donald trump.  the left has used the fbi to achieve its political objectives.  america cannot stand if such scandal goes unpunished.
 .  "tucker drops fbi bombshell: jan. 6 organizers 'were almost certainly working for the fbi'."
 .  "the covid deception: the dire consequences of the lack of accountability."  a few facts about covid you'll find hard to believe. 
election fraud
 .  "south carolina agency: the feds force us to give voter registration to foreign nationals."
 .  "'the most secure election in american history'."
 .  "bombshell exclusive: nationwide cellular network connects election equipment and gives federal government access to election systems at the precinct level."
 .  "bombshell exclusive: nationwide cellular network connects election equipment and gives federal government access to election systems at the precinct level."
 .  "here's how they did it: real-time election fraud."
 .  "gaslighted: it's clear democrats just stole another election."  yes, it's absolutely clear to anyone with eyes that see and a brain that thinks.
 .  "new film alleges 2020 was stolen, 2000 felonies prove it."
 .  "thousands of 'ballot mules' delivered tens of thousands of votes for biden?  ny post publishes devastating claims."
 .  "patrick byrne: there's enough evidence to decertify 3+ states."
 .  "secure the vote -- nothing is more iimportant!"
 .  "conservatives buzzing after d'souza drops must-see trailer for explosive election fraud movie -- watch."
 .  "how the 2020 election was stolen from donald trump."
 .  "rock solid proof of election fraud."  will this finally reveal all the election fraud?
 .  "courts repeatedly refused to consider trump's election claims on the merits."  there's a phrase that describes this: "justice denied."  and america's democracy may now be forever corrupted.
 .  "absolute proof."  of election fraud during the november 2020 election.  this is a two-hour video.  i suggest you jump ahead to 1:36:17 to see the description of cyber attacks and how they affected the election outcome.
 .   "yes, it was a stolen election."  it is official: biden did not win the election.  also: our country has been overwhelmingly corrupted by democrats.  they have thrown the idea of law and order right out the window.
climate
 .  "new documentary's 'cold truth' about climate."  this video is outstanding.  it proves the entire climate change narrative is a total lie.
 .  "the climate maniacs."
 .  "climate at a glance for teachers and students."  an excellent resource!
 .  "the fraud of climate change and the drive for control."  have you even heard of agenda 21?
other
 .  "what the great reset will really do to you, by tom deweese (american policy center)."
 .  "shame of the nation."  this is an outstanding article.  i hope everyone has a chance to read it.  you'll learn things you didn't know.  and you'll grieve for america.
 .  "'radicals' are racist criminals."  outstanding article!
 .  "glenn beck: here's how biden's new finance report is the 'most dangerous movement in the world right now'."  things are getting very iffy.
 .  "open letter to us legislators from dr. li-meng yan."  china is systematically destroying the united states of america.  the left is fine with that.
 .  "what the great reset will really do to you."  it will make freedom a thing of the past.
 .  "h.r. 127: a new bill in congress would literally end your 2nd amendment rights permanently."  a major step in taking your freedoms away.  a major step toward gun confiscation.  a major step toward destroying america as you knew it.   biden and company are doing what we thought they would.
 .  "the anarchy on our streets started in 2016, when the democrats renounced democracy."  so it is confirmed: democrats have destroyed america.
 .  "obama's coup is complete."

paying to be misled

"through usaid, doge has found reuters, bbc, new york times, politico, and other news organizations have been receiving us government money."
this is a huge scandal.  news agencies have been transformed into propaganda agencies by the left.

a delivery

due to a power outage, the house was very dark, so the paramedic asked kathleen, a three-year old girl to hold a flashlight high over her mommy so he could see while he helped deliver the baby.  little connor was born.
the paramedic lifted him by his feet and spanked him on his bottom and he began to cry.  the paramedic then asked the wide-eyed three-year old what she thought about what she had just witnessed.  she quickly responded, "he shouldn't have crawled in there in the first place, spank him again!"
