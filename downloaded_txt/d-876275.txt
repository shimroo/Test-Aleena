located in the heart of the educational, medical and music centers of nashville!
 
everything about the americana apartments has been planned for your convenience --- even the location. for people who attend or work in the several universities, medical centers, in nearby music city or west end office buildings, the americana is within easy walking distance. for those attending vanderbilt law school, the owen school of management or vanderbilt’s school of psychology, it is only a three minute stroll --- vanderbilt medical school is a few minutes longer.
also, within the three minute radius are a wide variety of restaurants, banks, and shopping areas. nashville’s town center is only minutes away thanks to the easy drive or conveniently scheduled bus service.
at the americana, you’re in the midst of every convenience yet you can still live in a world of your own --- away from the confusion, the rush and the congestion of typical urban complexes.
