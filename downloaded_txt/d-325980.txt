sunfaces & wall hangings







 lb is your source for artisan-made, unique wall decorations. sunfaces, moons, wall pocket planters, greenman relief plaques and more.







































 













piã±atas







i know, right?! why would a home & garden place sell piã±atas? we bring them up w/ our pottery from mexico. if the whole trailer were full of pottery and chimineas, we'd quickly exceed the weight limit. to utilize all the space in the trailer, we bring up hundreds of authentic, hand-made piã±atas.when you buy a piã±ata from us, you are helping support the family that makes them. we've known them for well over thirty years. we offer wholesale, and we retail the piã±atas here at our store in portland, or.
