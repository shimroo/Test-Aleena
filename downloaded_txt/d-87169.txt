 mailing lists cost is on a cpm (cost per thousand) basis, where the lists can range from $40 to upwards of $300 for names, addresses and email lists. many companies have a minimum amount of records for purchase, which is typically around $250. these lists are used for both direct mailers and mass email sends.        how do mailing lists work?  mailing lists typically include items such as first and last names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. the records are typically narrowed down by the purchaser based on demographics, location, and more. once the records are selected, the files are typically delivered in csv or api feed, based on the needs of the purchaser. from there these lists can be used to send out direct mailers or bulk email sends.        can you buy a mailing list?  yes, as long as the lists are being used for proper purposes that appeal to the us laws and regulations. list brokers will typically field out any inappropriate use for a mailing list, prior to purchasing. that way the mailing lists are only used legally and appropriately, like sending out a coupon either in the mail or via email.          more faqs                call:  800.741.0116             no waiting…no hassles            build list now                get a free quote
