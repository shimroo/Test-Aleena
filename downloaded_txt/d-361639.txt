welcome
				to bluegrass airlines
we
				fly the old propliners of yesteryear, from the golden age of
				flying.
if
				you enjoy flying by the "seat of your pants", then you
				are at the right place!
bluegrass
				airlines is a little different than most va's due to the fact
				that we don't put a lot of restrictions on our pilots.
we
				understand that this is just a hobby and is supposed to be fun!
we
				also listen to what our pilots like.  in fact, this va was
				built upon the idea and suggestions of our pilots.
in
				other words, bluegrass airlines is for the pilots and by the
				pilots!
if
				you would like to join us, choose a division from the list on the
				left side of this page, then click
				the "join bluegrass airlines" link on
				the top left of the page.   it's as simple as that!
we
				hope you enjoy flying with bluegrass airlines as much as we do.
