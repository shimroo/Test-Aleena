hospital room with a view. kalnes in norway








should you spend some days in a hospital - i can for sure recommend the regional hospital kalnes outside of sapsborg in norway.

spacious single rooms with a view to the water and forest landscape in the back and then the birds making the only sounds you can hear.

linked in:
sykehuset Ã¸stfold provides specialist health care services within somatic and mental health to the about 280 000 inhabitants of Ã¸stfold county. sykehuset Ã¸stfold runs hospitals in sarpsborg and moss, and provides local mental health care services at five locations.



november 2nd 2015 sykehuset Ã¸stfold fredrikstad relocated to a brand new state-of-the-art hospital building located at kalnes in sarpsborg. health care professionals and architects have, through close collaboration, designed a hospital that offers therapeutic and operational efficiency at the absolute elite level.Â  as well as creating premises with an atmosphere that is perceived as welcoming, friendly and accommodating by the patients, the relatives, and the staff. single room wards, new and advanced medical- and diagnostics equipment including pet/ct, and highly automatized logistics systems are just some of the features included in the new hospital.with 5000 employees, sykehuset Ã¸stfold is one of Ã¸stfoldâ€™s largest workplaces.

removing snow from the roof in valdres norway








with app. 1 meter of snow on the roof at our mountain cottage it is time for the family to remove most of it. still the snow is dry but later in the season with warmer weather the snow will fill with water and become several ton heavier maybe more than the roof can carry.
good alternative removing snow versus just skiing ðŸ˜ƒ

traditional winter cottage in valdres norway








after some snow in january it is a pleasure arriving at our cottage dressed for the winter.
this is in the central part of norway only some 3hrs drive from oslo. we build this place 31 years ago. it still have the standard of that time. ie no electricity but 12v current from 2 solar panels. water from an outside well (working the whole year also in the winter as we get the water from ca. 6 m under the soil surface (under the frost level)). via sms vi can before arrival start up our wallas oven and arrive to a warm and cosy cottage even when there is -20c as it was this day.

along the private road it is in all some 17 cottages along the 3km distance in here from the public road. in the winter the road will be plowed an open all weekends and the winter holidays season.
there is fresh ski tracks for cross country skiing right by the cottage opening up for a net of ski tracks for many, many kilometers in the region.

winter harbour at aker brygge in oslo norway








many sailers have their winter harbour along the small marina at aker brygge in oslo city.Â  it looks cold but we guess they have sufficient with electrical heaters and insulation to have it cosy inside, in spite of the cold outdoor climate down by the sea. at least they have a very central place both to shops an restaurants right here in the center of oslo.

december sunset already at 2:19pm in spydeberg, norway







the days are very short this far north in december. the sun is rising 9:11am and as you can see the sunset is already a little after 2pm.
but no reason to complain. i.e. north of the artic circle there is no sun at all.

make room for a buddy!  lauvskrike / siberian jay in valdres norway







lauvskrike / siberian jay hunting frozen bread in -18c

up at our mountain cottage for some winter days. after putting out some old bread it takes less than 5 minutes before the lauskrike / siberian jay is arriving. even frozen bread served in the cold outside Â temperature at -18c seems to be most attractive this morning.

camera: iphone6+. pp: camera+ in ipad.

the siberian jay (perisoreus infaustus) is a jay found in north eurasia. the species has a wide range (estimated global extent of occurrence 10,000,000 kmÂ²) and a large global population (estimated 680,000-1,400,000 in europe). it is one of three members of the genus perisoreus, the others being the sichuan jay, p. internigrans, restricted to the mountains of eastern tibet and northwestern sichuan, and the gray jay, p. canadensis, restricted to the boreal forest and western montane regions of north america. all three species store food and live year-round on permanent territories in coniferous forests. the siberian jay is known to wilderness travelers as a very inquisitive and fearless species, which can be seen near camps and fires, and which will even take food if some is left nearby.
