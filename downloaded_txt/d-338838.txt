introducing theloomia electronic layerthe loomia electronic layer is a mesh-based alternative to flex pcbs, printed ink on tpu and traditional e-textiles








            thin, flexible and drapable
          










more flexible than a flex pcb with up to 50% stretch for serpentine designs.








            low, consistent resistance
          










40% improvement in conductivity over printed ink on tpu with less deviation between units. traces will not crack and resistance doesn’t change when units are stretched.








            environmentally thoughtful 
          










silver-free conductors available for improved sustainability and no heavy chemical etchants used in production.








            scalable production
          










available at up to 20,000 units a week in an iso 13485- and iso 9001-certified facility. units can cost as low as $.05 per square inch.








            integrates into your materials 
          










our circuits are built for integration — no plastic housing needed. it can work with termination and trim of your choice.




















solving engineering challenges across industriesour components are engineered to perform in medical and wellness devices, automotive interiors, and robotics.
