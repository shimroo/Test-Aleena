“my son came home with a totally new outlook on having diabetes. he went swimming and rock climbing after meals feeling good about the decisions he made with his diabetes management. he was excited to try a new insulin pump and took on new insertion sites. it's incredible to see that by spending time with his peers away from home he is able to better take care of his t1d on his own!”
