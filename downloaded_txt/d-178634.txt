as we gather, we are reminded that kitchener public library and all of its locations are settled on land that is the traditional home of the chonnonton (chi-nawn-ton), anishinaabe (ah-ni-shnah-bay) and haudenosaunee (ho-deh-no-show-nee). we acknowledge that this land is part of the haldimand tract, an area that includes six miles on either side of the grand river and that was promised to the haudenosaunee six nations and other indigenous allies in 1784. we recognize and deeply appreciate indigenous peoples’ historical and ongoing connection to the land. we are thankful for and enriched by the contributions all indigenous peoples have made and continue to make in shaping and strengthening this community. as people who live and work in kitchener, we aim to renew our accountability to those indigenous nations and all indigenous peoples and communities living in canada and around the world today.  we are grateful for the opportunity to meet here and re-affirm our collective commitment to truth and reconciliation now and for future generations.
