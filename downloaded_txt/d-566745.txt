we make it all about you at baywest medical
at baywest medical, we have over 20 years of experience helping people change their lives for the better through our natural and efficient care.
our new port richey chiropractor dr. scott coletti, d.c. and his team are here to listen to your goals. whether you’ve been in an auto accident, suffered an injury, or are struggling to find the right solution, we’ll help you achieve ideal wellness so you can take hold of all life has to offer. dr coletti has built this practice through results for well over 20 years and the majority of our staff has been with baywest medical for over 15 years.









efficient, effective, and affordable care
as a results-driven practice, we'll never drag therapy out or put you through a long, exhausting plan or package. we're here to get the job done and get you back to wellness as quickly as possible. for most patients, that means three or four visits, not 10.
our team pays attention to the details, carefully listening to make sure we understand your situation accurately and completely. you'll never feel pushed through a routine program, as our doctors and staff tailor everything we do to your needs. we just focus on providing an answer for whichever concern brought you to our door—that's it!

we don't put up with pain
no matter what you need, we're here to help. our natural health care covers a range of conditions and services, including:



chiropractic care & rehab 
we have on-site digital x-rays, so we can show you a clear image of any structural misalignments we need to bring back into balance. care also includes cold laser therapy and physiotherapy to speed up healing.



auto and motorcycle accident chiropractic care
we have experience providing efficient care for acute injuries and pain following any kind of accident or collision. our team has seen everything from whiplash and neck injuries to head trauma and extremities problems.



peripheral neuropathy 
while there's no one set "cure" for this condition, our proven program has an 85-90% success rate for patients. we try to make healing as convenient as possible since you'll do 90% of the care in the comfort of your own home.





we're here for you
our care starts with a warm hello in a bright, clean office that smells like coffee and chocolate chip cookies. yes, we have our own cookie maker in the front office, but that's nothing compared to our genuine care for patients and our razor focus on improving your health.
we want you to feel comfortable, not pressured. everything we do is about getting to the bottom of pain so we can get you well again, both now and for the future.


get your health back today
we expect to see tangible improvements, and we don't expect it to take long. book now.
