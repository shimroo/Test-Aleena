new project
    this website written and maintained by milo.***
    this website is about sharing knowledge. the one thing the government can never take away from you is knowledge. the school systems are about training you for utility to big government and big business. this is the real information. knowledge has no known economic value to business or government. this is information independent of the military-industrial complex. just information. know how to program computers. learn on your own.
    to add a detailed real world example for the still unfinished college text book on computer programming (table of contents), i am going to post heavily commented and described open source code for a free music player. a working example (still very new and under construction) is at www.thissideofsanity.com. this source code is free for any legal non-commercial and/or non-profit and/or educational and/or private purpose.
    as of 1 july 2013, the united states federal trade commission makes individual websites responsible for any data gathering of information from children done by large company’s ads or plug-ins, while relieving those big companies of any responsibility. therefore, as much as i’d like to share this website with anyone of any age, i must ban everyone under the age of 13 from being allowed to visit this website or read any of the material on this website.

operating system technical comparison

overview
    this web site compares and contrasts operating systems. it originally started out on a small server in the engineering department of ohio state university to answer a single question: “on technical considerations only, how does  rhapsody (also known as  mac os x server) stack up as a server operating system (especially in comparison to  windows nt)?” the web site now compares and contrasts server operating systems and will in the near future expand to compare other kinds of operating systems.
    for non-technical persons: a general overview of operating systems for non-technical people is located at: kinds of operating systems. brief summaries of operating systems are located at: summaries of operating systems. there is an entire section of pages on individual operating systems, all formatted in the same order for easy comparison. the holistic area looks at operating systems from a holistic point of view and particular subjects in that presentation may be useful for comparison. some of the charts and tables may also be useful for specific comparisons.
    for technical persons: the system components area goes into detail about the inner workings of an operating system and the individual operating systems pages provide some technical information.
    this site is organized as an unbalanced tree structure, with cyclic graph hyperlinks and a sequential traversal path through the tree.
    this website will make use of cp/m (an early microcomputer os) to illustrate the functions of an operating system. cp/m has the teaching advantage of being very small and simple (and therefore easier to understand) while also having at least rudimentary examples of most operating system functions (excluding graphic user interfaces).

site goals
    this site is intended as a neutral technical evaluation, comparing and contrasting rhapsody with other server operating systems. all humans have biases. i am a fan of rhapsody, vms, macintosh, amigaos, next, and beos.
    i will attempt to be as complete, accurate, and precise as possible. i welcome correction, feedback, and additional information from informed sources.
    one of the really cool things about the internet is that once you achieve a certain critical mass of data, experts in the subject matter will just show up from all over the world and make constructive criticisms and provide all kinds of useful additional information.
    all web sites are either in a state of construction or dead, so comments about being “under construction” are generally extraneous. this site is not yet complete enough answer the question as stated. the goal is to have this site sufficiently complete to answer that question by the time apple releases rhapsody in fall of 1998.
    most of the work so far has been in catalogueing information about each operating system (see individual os pages for details). i have started charts on costs, hardware supported, file systems, release dates, and music.
    lots of thanks go out to the many persons who have taken the time to answer questions and provide url references. a complete list of persons and web sites and books quoted is found in the site footnotes. to contribute additional information or to make constructive criticism of any kind, send a message to milo.
    i will attempt to stick to the facts as much as possible. i will provide only as much editorial commentary as is necessary to make the technical facts clear. all opinions are mine unless otherwise attributed.
    it is unlikely that any single individual has all the knowledge necessary to complete an accurate technical survey of all operating systems that can be used as server oss. so, i need and welcome and appreciate all of volunteer help.
    i (milo) have edited the material into a web site and michael m is the new artist.


using this site
    a few quick caveats about a technical evaluation:

pure technical concerns are not the only or even the most important considerations in the choice of an operating system. economic, environmental, psychological, and political factors can come into play. for example, a particular operating system may be the best technical choice, but may be too expensive. this web site only examines technical issues.

interpretation of raw facts requires some degree of technical expertise. no conclusions are provided in this site. interpretation and conclusions are left to the reader.

not all technical issues are equal. and the weighting of technical issues varies by application and environment. for example, a particular feature may be absolutely essential to one organization, important to another, trivial to a third, and an unacceptable impediment to a fourth.
hardware and the interactions between hardware and software can play a significant factor in both quantifiable and anecdotal results.
variations in software, even software that shares the same name and version number, can play a significant factor in both quantifiable and anecdotal results.
variations in the personnel creating, administering, and maintaining the computer system (the human factor) can play a significant factor in both quantifiable and anecdotal results.

    this site is organized in an unbalanced tree structure, with cyclic graph hyperlinks and a sequential traversal path through the tree.

holistic issues: a look at issues regarding an operating system as a whole, such as reliability, speed, ease of use, etc.
system components: a look at the specific components of a computer system.
special topics: a look at the specific topics, including content creation, programming languages, and assembly language.

1.1 mb quicktime movie of bill gates explaining his criteria for selecting the best operating system.(transcribed below for those who don’t want to take the download time to see the video clip)

    “to create a new standard, it takes something that’s not just a little bit different, it takes something that’s really new and really captures people’s imagination and the macintosh, of all the machines i’ve ever seen, is the only one that meets that standard.” — bill gates


    “the computer revolution is the most advertised revolution in world history. yet one of the funny things about it is that we probably still underestimate its impact.” — herman kahnm7
