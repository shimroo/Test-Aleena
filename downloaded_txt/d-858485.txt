a fishing destination
like no other
while hawk lake lodge boasts one of the best smallmouth fisheries on the planet, our waters also have without question the finest trophy walleye fishing in the world. if you have never caught a true trophy walleye then do we have a treat for you. the hawk lake lodge fishery has bar none the largest collection of trophy walleye anywhere in the world. in 2017 our fishermen recorded easily more than 381 walleye 26 inches or larger with several over 34+. also, an estimated 40+ inch walleye was lost at the boat in the summer of 2014. many lodges count the number of 30 inch walleye caught each year on one hand. at hawk lake we catch dozens. hawk lake lodges offers you 3 different lakes that have 30+ inch walleye while 40 inch walleye have been spotted by several fisherman and it is just a matter of time when one is caught, breaking the catch and release world record, again.



























 







on average some of the largest walleye we have ever seen.

a unique drive-to resort on
private waters
at hawk lake lodge we have spared no effort to see that our guest have the most extraordinary vacation. as expected in a lodge of this quality, the meals are superb. great care is taken in preparation and serving, in an atmosphere that is warm, casual and intimate. guest cabins, all with lakeside decks, are private, spacious and tastefully furnished. geared to your complete comfort and convenience.
 
we are a drive-to resort on private waters. you don’t have to jump on a float plane with limited luggage and even sparser accommodations in hopes of finding virgin waters. your party doesn’t have to hope that there aren’t any weather issues that would ground a float plane at a fly-in. instead you can drive right into hawk lake lodge, with as much luggage and personal effects as you would like. once here you will be fishing waters few fishermen have ever seen. the combination of first-class accommodations, world class fishing and easy access is unparalleled.

our guests say it best…





we have been coming to the hawk lake lodge for 20 years because of their philosophy of catch and release. because of this philosophy, hawk lake lodge has seen trophy catches for all species. we are still coming to hawk lake lodge because of the fishing, the exceptional food and facilities, as well all of the recreational opportunities offered.
larry and pat johnson




hawk lake lodge is an awesome place to visit! the fishing is incredible… trophy walleyes and smallmouth every day for us, including small children. the owners and staff were the best we have ever been around (and i have been to dozens of lodges and resorts in canada). the boats, electronics, etc. were excellent. the food and drink was out of this world as well! we will be coming back many more times.
rob meister




our trip… 5 star all the way! susan and i both were overwhelmed with the accommodations, the hospitality, the service, the cuisine and the fishing. as i told you, i’ve been smallmouth fishing all over ontario for over 28 years and hawk lake lodge is by far the best for a total fishing experience.
