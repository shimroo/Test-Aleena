about me 



luna raven
founder & editor







welcome to crescent moon goddess. i'm raven—a 30-something instagrammer with a hippie soul and a gothic edge. think of me as your friendly neighborhood witch who's all about keeping it real. i'm into tarot, crystals, astrology, and all that mystical stuff, but i also believe in practical magic—stuff you can actually use in your everyday life. grab a cup of herbal tea (or coffee if that's your jam), and let's chat about the universe, self-improvement, and maybe even how to make a killer potion or two.
