gallery highlights



papercut ketubahs

the art of papercutting has a long history in jewish tradition. these intricately cut patterns, with motifs ranging from architecture to nature, are very elegant and have timeless appeal.




photo ketubahs

send us your favorite photo and we will turn it into a unique, one-of-a-kind ketubah. this is very special and personal and will always fill your hearts with fond memories.




text only ketubahs

it is exciting for us to see how many couples are choosing the text only ketubah so custom artwork can be added. we offer a variety of shapes, sizes and fonts
              so the text will perfectly complement the final piece.
