						"after using the freshlife sauna, i'm more energized. it has provided pain relief and reduced swelling in my knee...my skin is clear due to the detoxification process of the sauna. my digestive issues are so much better...the heat eliminates toxins from your body. i am a big fan of the far infrared sauna! thank you, freshlife, for being the leader in wellness in our area!"

						to me, the best reason to shop at a business is their employees. those that work at freshlife are simply the best. friendly, warm, welcoming & knowledgeable about the goods & services they offer. our area needs this shop & i love that it is locally-owned & also that it stocks products from local vendors too.
