the

                    a cooling breeze...

  the kameni islands formed 

after the caldera. eleven eruptions since 197 b.c. have made the two islands.

 santorini is the last of the 
              cyclades islands to the south. the closests islands are ios, folegandros, 
              sikinos to the north, anafi and amorgos to the east and crete to 
              the south.

              we refer to it as one, but actually it is a complex of five islands. 
              santorini (thira) is the main island and around it thirasia and 
              aspronisi (parts of the ancient stroggili) and the two volcanic 
              islands palea kameni and nea kameni.

              it was one island named stroggili (circle in greek) until about 
              1645 bc, when the volcano in the middle of the island erupted and 
              caldera was created. the two volcanic islands appeared much later 
              from various eruptions starting from 157 bc until the last one in 
              the 20th century (1950).

              many reasons made this island famous worldwide and more or less 
              we all have seen a picture of it (it was that picture the travel 
              agency used for greece). there is a talk about the connection between 
              thira and mythical 
              atlantis. also jules verne made santorini famous with its books 
              "twenty thousand leagues under the sea" and "the 
              mysterious island" where captain nemo and his crew watch the 
              volcano eruption. he was one of the visitors and scientists that 
              came to thira during the eruptions of 1866 - 1870 and wrote the 
              well known book just after it. it is realy the mysterious island, 
              the volcano rules, the caldera view is the most breathtaking one 
              on the planet! 

              if you are after the caldera view have a look at fira, 
              oia, 
              imerovigli, 
              firostefani, 
              megalochori and akrotiri.
              for the best beaches check perissa, 
              kamari, 
              perivolos, 
              vlihada 
              and red 
              beach.

              the unique caldera, the energy and the beauty of the island are 
              the most important reasons for being ranked as the top island in 
              europe and one of the once in a life time must see destinations 
              of the world.

              if you want to know how to reach it, santorini is connected to piraeus, 
              thessaloniki, crete, rhodes, kos and all the major cyclades islands 
              (mykonos, paros, naxos, sifnos, milos, tinos, syros) by boat and 
              athens and many countries direct by plane.
