i work with business owners who suspect their business is stuck - that it has reached a plateau - but what they really want is to double their client base and make more money.



hi!  
i am dianne e. dawson, m.a. the business development coach.  is your business where you expected it to be by now?  are you generating the revenues you deserve for the work you put in?

most professionals never reach their full income potential.  don't spend your life in this group.







no matter what goals you've set... the ability to bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be in business is critical to your success.

business issues i work with clients to addressa quick reference for you

i work with business owners, corporate leaders and private practitioners in the areas of marketing, internet strategy, and business development. 
together we will review the areas in which you want to work and identify a strategy for achieving your goals.
