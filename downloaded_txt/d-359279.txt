how shall we picture the kingdom of god?
it’s like a mustard seed.
mark 4: 30-32










after 40 years of ministry, the mustard seed foundation has officially concluded its operations. the foundation began with its incorporation as a nonprofit organization in south carolina in 1983 and awarding of first grants in 1984. over the last four decades, it awarded roughly $110 million in thousands of grants and scholarships globally. the past year was the last year in which we awarded new grants, and the organization wrapped up its operations in early 2024.
this website is still being made available to inform of our closure and to share a glimpse of the work of the foundation over the last four decades. through it we provide our final report and continued access to more detailed annual reporting from the last few years of our operations. we have also provided access to a brief commemorative video created to share a bit of the broader msf story.
please join us in celebrating what god has enabled us to support and the amazing individuals and ministries around the world in whom we have made investments over the years.
