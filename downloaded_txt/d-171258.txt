contemporary furniture design
we work mainly with other design professionals and are more than happy to work out an idea you may have, build off a cocnept sketch, or start completely from scratch with a fresh design. no style restrictions. our designers will work with you and provide suggestions to realize your vision. by providing precise drawings & 3d renderings to all of our clients, they can see the piece come to life. we then typically work through multiple iterations until we find exactly what our clients are looking for before proceeding with fabrication.
