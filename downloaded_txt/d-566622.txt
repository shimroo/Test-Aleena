welcome 
                to old world apothecary 
herbs were some of the first 
                  medicines known to man,
                  and apothecaries were pharmacists who dispensed a
                  variety of remedies, including herbs. the ancient wisdom
                  of herbal medicines still applies to today's health concerns, 
                  and more and more people are discovering how herbs can support 
                  their health and overall well-being. as a modern-day herbalist, 
                  i help those who wish to explore an herbal approach to their 
                  health concerns. i offer private consultations, classes & 
                  workshops, and a variety of herbal products that are 100% natural.

                  abundance of information and tools to help guide you on
