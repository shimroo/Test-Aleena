the yebo process
step 1: tell us about your project
we want to know everything about your project. the more details that we know, the easier it will be for us to come up with a solution for you!


the yebo process
step 2: discovery and quote
creating the correct packaging, box or display takes some careful thought and this is what separates yebo from the rest. at the end of this step we should have provided a quote or two with specific options and design.


the yebo process
step 3: sales order and structural sample
we provide a sales order that shows you what we agreed to manufacture. we send you the sample for review. we make changes as necessary until we meet your expectations and you approved a structural sample.


the yebo process
step 4: graphic design and art approval
now that we have approved structural design, you then place the art onto the pdf dieline we provided and submit back to us. we review the art, prep it for production and send a final proof for your approval. once you approve this final proof we start production.


the yebo process
step 5: production and shipping
finally, we will produce and ship your packaging to you. we always try our best to meet even the toughest project deadlines.
