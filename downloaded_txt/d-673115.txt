introducing the new s.h.i.m board. (signal head interface module)
this new pc board will interface the small signal head wires to either  a screw terminal or rj45 (ethernet) connector. no more soldering those tiny wires to something in  order to run them to the signal head controllers.

 cantilevers, gantry bridges and bracket post bridgesbridge signals are designed for installation on our cantilevered signal bridges, our bracket posts (signal platform) or on any gantry or cantilevered signal bridge that you may have purchased elsewhere. we manufacture signal kits for bridges with the...
 dual head - 3 color signalsalmost every north american railroad has its own unique design. you may specify what your road requires. as you see below we offer many arrangements. the heads are completely assembled with imbedded leds, a flush back with thin wires out the bottom and...
