                at the north shore playhouse in massachusetts,
                pulitzer prize winning critic william henry iii
                wrote, "in the part charles lamb called
                unplayable, he is magnificent."

                corey has appeared in over a hundred features,
                including home of the brave,
                the devil and daniel webster,

                wayne, as well as delivering a memorable
                characterization of wild bill hickock opposite

                free. 

                as a director, corey has amassed such credits as

                mr. corey's professional actors workshop,

                talented actors, directors, and screenwriters,
                has been described by washington's the
                national observer as, "a major
                influence in the motion picture industry."
                he was appointed professor of theater arts at
                california state university in northridge, and

                he has conducted seminars at emory university in
                atlanta, and for the canadian film institute in
                vancouver, british columbia.

                jeff corey was also awarded three citations for
                his work as a motion picture combat photographer
                in world war ii. in october 1945 he received a
                citation from secretary of the navy james
                forrestal and captain edward steichen with the
                following commendation, "his sequence of a
                kamikaze attempt on the carrier yorktown, done in
                the face of grave danger, is one of the great
                picture sequences of the war in the pacific, and
                reflects the highest credit upon corey and the
                u.s. navy photographic service."

  corey, 88; blacklist led actor to teaching
his list of students is a who's who of the
  hollywood elite since 
  the 1950's. they include james dean, anthony perkins, jane fonda and jack
  nicholson.
  "acting is life study, and corey's classes got me into looking at life as
  an artist."  jack nicholson




   by
  jon thurber, times staff writer
jeff
  corey, a gifted actor who was blacklisted for refusing to name names before
  the house committee on un-american activities in the 1950s but emerged as one
  of the most sought-after teachers in hollywood, has died. he was 88.
  perhaps best-known for his post-blacklist roles in "butch cassidy and the
  sundance kid," "in cold blood," "little big man" and
  on the tv sitcoms "one day at a time" and "night court,"
  corey died friday morning at st. john's medical center in santa monica of
  complications from a fall earlier in the week at his home in malibu.

  to generations of actors, directors and writers, corey's name on the blacklist
  didn't mean a thing. they came to his informal classes for his insightful
  ideas on the craft of acting and views on how to handle challenging roles.

  his list of students makes up a who's who of the hollywood elite since the
  1950s and includes james dean, anthony perkins, shirley knight, jane fonda,
  peter fonda, robert blake, leonard nimoy, robin williams, rob reiner, robert
  towne, roger corman, penny marshall, taylor hackford and a young jack
  nicholson.

  "acting is life study, and corey's classes got me into looking at life as
  an artist," nicholson said years later.
  those who knew corey's teaching process said he was a stanislavsky method
  teacher but with a small "m." his process was eclectic and involved
  one-on-one work with an actor. he created improvisational exercises that
  allowed actors to engage their imaginations and subconscious minds in pursuit
  of a theme that they could apply to their roles.

  corey was always pursuing a current underlying emotional and psychological
  theme in the actor's work. and in doing that, he was trying to help the actor
  relate to the here and now rather than the arcane notion of the character's
  circumstances.
  "i tell my students, 'respect the instrument. it is you doing the
  acting,' " corey told the times some years ago. "by all means, you
  must be responsive to the meaning of the play, to what the author meant and to
  what the audience will ultimately see. engage your own intuition, use your own
  frames of reference and give something which is uniquely yours; put something
  rich into your performance rather than some external result that hasn't got
  your face. simplicity is the cherished quality."
  corey didn't set out to be a teacher. an indifferent student in high school in
  new york city, he took a drama class and became intrigued with acting. he
  earned a scholarship to the feagin school of dramatic arts, then a leading
  theater school in new york city, which he later said kept him from a career
  selling sewing machines. from there, he did work in shakespearean repertory
  and then worked with a traveling children's theater troupe. his first meaty
  stage role was in leslie howard's touring production of "hamlet," in
  which he played rosencrantz.

  corey and his wife moved to los angeles, and he found work, appearing in 23
  films from 1940 to 1943, including "the devil and daniel webster,"
  "my friend flicka," and "joan of arc." he joined the navy
  in 1943 and was assigned to the ship yorktown as a combat photographer. he
  earned citations for some footage he shot during a kamikaze attack on the
  ship.
  after the war, corey returned to hollywood and resumed his busy career playing
  heavies in such films as "the killers" and "brute force."
  he also played the role of a psychiatrist in "home of the brave,"
  one of his best performances.
  corey seemed ready for even better film parts as the second lead or top
  character actor, when he was subpoenaed to testify before the house committee
  on un-american activities, which had been investigating communist influence in
  hollywood since 1947.

  the actor was scheduled to appear at the hearing in downtown los angeles in
  september 1951. he was 37 and had a wife and three daughters to support. but
  he took the 5th amendment and didn't work again as an actor in hollywood for
  more than a decade, missing out on countless movie opportunities and what
  would later be considered the golden age of television.
  "most of us were retired reds. we had left it, at least i had, years
  before," corey told patrick mcgilligan, the co-author of "tender
  comrades: a backstory of the hollywood blacklist" who also teaches film
  at marquette university. "the only issue was, did you want to just give
  them their token names so you could continue your career, or not? i had no
  impulse to defend a political point of view that no longer interested me
  particularly .... they just wanted two new names so they could hand out more
  subpoenas."

  he found work as a laborer earning $14 a day and enrolled as a freshman at
  ucla on the gi bill. he eventually earned a degree in speech therapy. corey
  would later say that he fell into teaching somewhat by accident. he said a
  student who was failing miserably in another program organized the first class
  and talked him into teaching it, which he did in the garage of his hollywood
  hills home. carol burnett, then a freshman at ucla, was among the students.
  word of mouth kept the classes going as corey, a self-effacing man, didn't
  promote himself or advertise and did little to encourage enrollment. by the
  mid-1950s, he was the most sought-after acting coach in hollywood. studios
  that would not hire corey as an actor because of the blacklist actively sent
  their young talent to study with him.

  corey himself wouldn't start working again in films until 1962, when he was
  offered parts in the films "the balcony" and "the yellow
  canary." one of his students, pat boone, helped him get the part in
  "the yellow canary" by talking the legal department at fox into
  taking him on.over the next 35 years, corey appeared in more than 70 films or
  television series. he also got chances to direct. according to mcgilligan,
  corey was "an actor's actor, someone that actors loved to watch because
  he was always doing something interesting in his work."

  "jeff was articulate about ideas, provocative and inspirational,"
  mcgilligan told the times on saturday. "he was a wonderful actor who we
  never fully got to see because of the blacklist."

  corey is survived by hope, his wife of 64 years; three daughters, eve corey
  poling of atlanta; jane corey of elk, calif., and emily corey of los angeles;
  and six grandchildren.
