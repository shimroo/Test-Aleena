http://www.lemko.org was created 
                  primarily for those whose roots come from that part of galicia 
                  known as lemkovyna, or lemkivshchyna in ukrainian, mostly descendants 
                  of the turn of the century "ruthenian/rusyn/ukrainian" 
                  immigrants, particularly english speaking north americans, who 
                  wish to learn more about their heritage.
                  as a result of the first partition of poland in 1772, galicia 
                  was occupied by austria, eventually it wound up in the austro-hungarian 
                  empire until the empire's disintegration in 1918.
                  prior to it, and from 1918 until 1939, galicia was administered 
                  by poland. currently, the territory of lemkovyna finds itself 
                  in the south-eastern post-ww ii poland.
