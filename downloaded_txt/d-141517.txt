welcome…if you write a book, you want folks to read it. a tailor-made man, it’s called. the short pieces you’ll find here are not excerpts, (although that’s an idea,) but more like hors-d’oeuvres at a dinner party. anyhow i think about a lot of stuff in and out of the clothing business, and this is a place to keep it.i make a living selling clothes, not books. but there’s a primal urge i feel, to communicate. like in the program. (you know?) something wants to make me share. i’m pretty sure it’s, at worst, a harmless desire, at best something of value. they tell me having an author’s page will help me get folks to know about my work. that’s you. thanks for tuning in.i like to write, and just about every day i have some thought or reaction that i want to explore, to condense, to fit into memory as a formula. churchill said, “i don’t know what i think about that. i haven’t spoken about it yet.” i would substitute “written about it.” for me it’s the intellectual digestive process. so here you’ll find some musings, some attempts at making sense, some stumbling articulation of my observation and experience. i’ll try to keep them short. succinct. and maybe among the gravel, sand and fool’s gold, you’ll find some valuable nuggets.
