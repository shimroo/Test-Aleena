upcoming events at hickory ridge history museumour museum events are open to the public!
















find out what life was like when the western north carolina high country was first being settled at hickory ridge history museum. educators and tour guides lead you in an immersive experience through six historic cabins, complete with artifacts and furnishings.created in 1980, hickory ridge history museum strives to recreate the atmosphere of a small mountain community to show guests about the daily lives of our colonial ancestors.staffed with historic interpreters in period clothing, hickory ridge history museum's series of authentic, historic cabins give visitors a glimpse into the past and a feeling for the daily lives of early mountain settlers.focused on the period of 1785 - 1805, the museum provides insight into the self sufficiency of our forefathers by highlighting the skills they possessed such as hearth side cooking, spinning, candle making, blacksmithing, and so much more.



horn in the westâ„¢ outdoor drama brings to life the famous frontiersman daniel boone and the hardy settlers of the blue ridge mountains in their struggle to preserve their freedom during the years before and during the war for independence.the drama highlights the settlers who came to the region seeking freedom and escape from british tyranny.Â dr. geoffrey stuart, a prominent british physician, comes to the colony of carolina to study the dreaded disease smallpox, bringing his wife and son.through hardship and danger, house-raising and romance, the ties that bind the stuart family and the small pioneer community grow.Â dr. stuart finds himself a respected leader in this hidden mountain community but has to resolve his conflicted feelings of loyalty to the crown and his family's sympathy for the regulators and their fight for american independence.
