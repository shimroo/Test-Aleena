our mission is to build a trail system that connects and enhances our community.






communities connected by trails.
we are the driving force behind a 200+ mile planned system of multi-use trails.  a dynamic network of connected streams, parks, businesses, and neighborhoods which provides for the enjoyment and economic development of our community.  trails play a crucial role in our community's quality of life and make this an awesome place to live, work, and play. with 110 miles of trail built, there's something for everyone regardless of age, abilities, or interests.
