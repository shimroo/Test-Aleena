m4a3 75mm sherman from 6th tank battalion at naha airfield, okinawa, april 1945


 



this m4a3 sherman (build log) from the company hq, 6th tank battalion is rendered from a few reference photos of shermans stationed around naha airfield after its capture in april 1945. the battle of okinawa was one of the bloodiest in the pacific theatre and many shermans were knocked out by ferocious infantry that were… continue reading m4a3 75mm sherman from 6th tank battalion at naha airfield, okinawa, april 1945

asuka 75mm m4a3 sherman: okinawa


 



i’m new to the pto scene and the sherman field mods there is so fascinating. i’ve changed my mind multiple times on what i want to build for the sherman contest – tawara, iwo jima and okinawa tanks are visually quite different. in the end i chose a photo build of an okinawa tank from… continue reading asuka 75mm m4a3 sherman: okinawa

m4a3 (76) w sherman thunderbolt vi, winter 1944


 



this kit is based on meng’s m4a3 with a small number of replacement parts, which was detailed in my build log. the model is a based on a reference photo dated winter 1944, probably when abrams was on his way to the bastogne. this whitewash scheme had been rendered in different books but the actual… continue reading m4a3 (76) w sherman thunderbolt vi, winter 1944

meng ts-043 (76) w sherman


 



the whitewashed thunderbolt vi cover of meng’s new sherman kit got me interested. ammo’s sherman book has a color plate but i dunno where the author got his references from. photos of finished work. tracks are typically the most painful and meng’s offerings were some of the worst in terms work required. this time they… continue reading meng ts-043 (76) w sherman

dragon/platz 6873 panzer iv ausf. d


 



this kit is a simplification of dragon’s panzer iv lineage. an attempt to make it simple to build, the kit was a joy to finish and i got to practice weathering on it. it was built in 2018-ish i think, but didn’t get a chance to take photos. the only downside is the ds tracks,… continue reading dragon/platz 6873 panzer iv ausf. d

this tank is the no. 421 with the 15 pzrg, 11 pzdiv at kursk. kit used is the popular takom panzer iii ausf. m blitz 8002 kit. i have blogged the build. even though “421” is one of the decal options, the kit requires some surgery to get it accurate with the references, the main… continue reading panzer iii ausf.m, no.421, 15 pzrg, 11 pz.div., kursk 1943

takom panzer iii ausf. m / blitz 8002


 



released earlier in 2020, this takom kit is one of the first panzer iiis that re-attempted to break dragon’s stronghold on the line. with takom however their build tried to be simpler and more tamiya-like, let’s see how it holds up. finished gallery images are here. the kit includes marking for the very well-photographed “421”… continue reading takom panzer iii ausf. m / blitz 8002

takom maus v2 1/35


 



this is takom’s maus v2 and i followed the excellent research by christos (thanks!) to finish the kit as the initial rollout v2 with lightened road wheels. there are a few references with it having both antenna up, so i scavenged my parts box and found a couple of dragon ones i could use. when i… continue reading takom maus v2 1/35
