pupils grow into confident young adults as a direct result of the autonomy the school provides them and the highest levels of pastoral support. 
isi inspection 2017



for very bright, confident, motivated boys who like to think for themselves, st paul's provides a truly unrivalled education. a unique start in life.
good schools guide 2021 - st paul's school



academic results are phenomenal: over 50% of a levels and pre us and 86% of gcses achieved a*s with 18% of leavers heading to ivy league universities.
tatler schools guide 2021 - st paul's school



this is a school that suits boys of all types: ‘we love bookworms and rugby players’. all they ask is that pupils have a real enthusiasm for learning and an agile, enquiring mind.
tatler schools guide 2021 - st paul's juniors



the st paul's recipe for academic stardom remains the same: cream off the very brightest, recruit the very best, light the blue touch paper and stand clear. the resulting sparks illuminate the sky. 
good schools guide 2021 - st paul's school



a school in which almost anything seems possible. head suggests that a child here is a bit like ‘an octopus on zip wire – two legs are needed at all points to take proper care of academic matters - but that still leaves a further six’.
good schools guide 2021 - st paul's juniors















the clerihew, a whimsical four-line biographical poem was invented at st paul’s by edmund clerihew bentley (1875-1956). one of his best known is:
sir christopher wren
said, “i am going to dine with some men.
if anyone calls,
say i am designing st paul’s.
