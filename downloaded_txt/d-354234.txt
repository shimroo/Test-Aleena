may 30, 2007tyler saverysatellite standard group has merged with sirius buzzfind the latest ssg news and forums at www.siriusbuzz.comwe here at ssg have spent a bit over a year building this site into something that we hope you consider valuable. while we have been adept at keeping you informed with information, we have had challenges with taking the site to the next level, and integrating features that you the readers have been looking for.we are very pleased to announce that satellite standard group is merging with siriusbuzz.com to become a destination site that will not only give you the latest news, but will also allow you the reader to participate in forums to discuss satellite radio. we look forward to serving you as “sirius buzz – satellite standard and beyond”.this merger came about because the folks at siriusbuzz and ssg have a common passion in satellite radio, and we wanted to offer fans, consumers, and investors with a similar a common place to access as well as discuss information. best of all……no waiting for the doj and fcc. you get all the synergies now!!!!what to expect- expect the same dynamic articles and coverage that you have seen with ssg as well as the tremendous opinions and articles from siriusbuzz. ssg writers will transition to the siriusbuzz domain beginning may 30, 2007- expect a forum community that will meet your needs in a well structured manner. whether it is discussion about stock, installations, hardware, or simply chatter about the shows on satellite radio, there will be a forum for you to participate in.- expect the new site to change rapidly to meet your needs, and for the look feel and usability of the site to be crisp, clean, and user friendly.- expect prizes for participation as this venture launches.- expect a more varied opinion, and instant access to comments and reaction to news and articles in the forums.- expect a more user friendly place to discuss satellite radio that is free of spamming posts, and meaningless chatter.- a more interactive site that has the ability to grow, meet needs, and deliver the highest quality content available regarding satellite radio.- expect to see the ssg sister site www.satcos.blogspot.com to become integrated, and to take on a more prominent role to seek out and publish the true consumer sentiment and opinions about satellite radio.what happens to the archived ssg content?- the existing ssg content will remain in place at www.satellitestandard.com. we have not yet determined how the existing ssg content will be accessed from the siriusbuzz site, but will be working on solutions for that.does this mean ssg was sold?- no, not at all. money did not change hands. we made a decision to invest ssg into what we feel will be a place where our readers can have a better overall experience. we and the folks at siriusbuzz simply made a decision that as a team we could provide a better end product for you the readers.how do we contact you?- you can reach ssg writers the same way you always have, but we will also now have siriusbuzz e-mail accounts which we will be transitioning into.i have email or rss feeds what do i do?- simply go to www.siriusbuzz.com and click the subscribe button therehow do i participate in the forums?- a simple registration is all that is required. once you register, not only can you begin to post, but you could win prizes as well.the name is siriusbuzz, what about xm?- xm stories, posts, etc. are very welcomed at “siriusbuzz – satellite standard and beyond”. with the satellite radio merger happening, it is unclear what name, if the merger is approved, the new service will have. sirius buzz and satellite standard have both established their respective names, and both will be maintained. if a new name for a merged satellite radio company comes out of left field, we will cross the bridge at that time. this is a satellite radio community, be it sirius, xm, or even slacker.why?- because we felt that this will give you a better product…..plain and simpleit is our hope that you the readers will embrace this change, and participate in making the new site something special. please feel free to contact me at satellitestandard@gmail.com or tyler@siriusbuzz.com with any questions or comments.6/01/2007 02:06:00 pm

 forbes: joan lappin positive on sirius


adviser soapboxsirius is sucking a lot lessjoan e. lappin, gramercy capital management 05.31.07, 6:10 pm et, forbesuncertainty surrounding the deal to merge xm satellite radio and sirius satellite radio has put both stocks on the discard pile and pushed them to new lows, but after bottoming on may 16 at $2.66, sirius has been on a tear. very funny, you might say, since just about everyone who owns it is underwater, but sirius is up almost 10% since mid-may, while the dow has been about flat. we think sirius is worth a lot more than its present price for those who are patient.the naysayers have always thought that satellite radio is not a valid business model. i view it more like any utility. once you launch the satellites, it doesn’t cost much more to service added customers beyond billing and customer care. unlike the cable industry, in this one you don’t even have to do a "truck roll" and send a technician to install it.if you can imagine such an absurdity, goldman sachs recently, with sirius at $2.86, put out a 25-page sell recommendation suggesting 20% risk in the stock, or another 50 cents to the downside. perhaps they are trying to appeal to an audience of short sellers, but aren’t they a little late? the short position in sirius, usually only about a two-day trading supply, fell to its lowest level in a long time in the most recent may nasdaq report.even as investors don’t find the satellite business model appealing, the car companies definitely do. they have concluded that factory installed satellite radio is an attractive selling point to new buyers, particularly when included in the price of the vehicle. sirius satellite radio has been working hard with some success with ford motor to test bundle a three-year package into some models when purchased. kia (sirius) and hyundai (xm) are building satellite radios into 100% of the cars they will manufacture for the 2009 model year, which will begin mid-year 2008. high-end brands such as mercedes (sirius) are equipping more than 80% of their production with factory-installed units. chrysler (sirius) will be moving from satellite radios in 36% of all cars manufactured in 2006 to 42% of new vehicle production in 2007. probably due to its other distractions, general motors has been slow to accelerate the number of xm radios it builds into cars, but now, in its seventh model year, it too will feature them in nearly 44% of vehicles this year.xm satellite radio has stated a goal of adding 1.1 million to 1.3 million net new subscribers in 2007, and sirius expects to add about 2 million net subs this year. if those numbers turn out to be correct, xm will end this year with 9 million subs and sirius will approach 8 million for a combined total of 17 million users, compared with 14 million at the end of last year. once the industry reaches 20 million users, you have a viable base for selling national ads. consider that there are more than 230 million cars on the road in the u.s. that leaves a lot of cars to penetrate in the future, whether or not the merger is allowed to proceed...read more: here5/31/2007 09:20:00 pm

 nab gets even more desperate: hires law firm to prepare report against merger


law firm says sirius/xm merger would violate antitrust lawvia www.radioink.com, may 31a report prepared by the nab-retained law firm of crowell & moring that has been sent to lawmakers and filed with the fcc characterizes the proposed satellite radio merger of xm and sirius as "clearly anticompetitive." the report reads, in part: "the proposed merger would replace this duopoly market structure, set up specifically by the fcc to ensure at least some level of price and service competition, with a monopolist in the downstream subscription market that is unrestrained in its ability to harm competition. there simply is no ‘fix’ that will restore the competitive structure of this marketplace, and thus doj should challenge the transaction to preserve existing and future competition."...read more: here5/31/2007 07:42:00 am

 cbs buys internet radio site


cbs buys last.fm for $280 millionby kevin kingsbury, may 31, 2007; page b5, wall street journalcbs corp. acquired social-networking web site last.fm ltd. for $280 million, delving further into the music business where it was once one of the major players.last.fm, founded in 2002, claims it has more than 15 million active users in more than 200 countries and is focused on music.the wall street journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported two weeks ago that cbs was working on agreements with last.fm and fellow social-networking site facebook inc. to allow users to post cbs video clips to their profiles. (see related article1.)"last.fm is one of the most well-established, fastest-growing online community networks out there," said cbs president and chief executive leslie moonves in a statement. he added the site's "demographics also play perfectly to cbs's goal to attract younger viewers and listeners across our businesses."last.fm's team -- including founders felix miller, martin stiksel and richard jones -- will continue to independently run the site."part of our interactive strategy has been to build communities around all of our properties," said mr. moonves. "cbs radio has given us a powerful way to create such communities for decades, and it continues to do so. with last.fm we're adding a next-generation platform to allow audiences to communicate with us and each other as never before."cbs said in december it would launch a new cbs records label, reviving a name associated for several decades with such artists as michael jackson, the eagles, barbara streisand and earth, wind & fire...read more: here5/31/2007 07:37:00 am

 auto contracts to drive satellite radio


automotive contracts seen driving satellite radiowed may 30, 2007 2:38 pm et, by sue zeidler, (reuters)whether the two largest satellite radio companies merge or not, the future of the industry is riding on automotive contracts at a time when competition for in-car entertainment is increasing.sirius satellite radio inc.'s  bid to buy xm satellite radio holdings inc. for $4 billion would help the two companies cut losses, compete more effectively and turn profits faster, the companies have said. but they have also stipulated they don't need the deal to survive since they already have contracts in place to install millions of radios in new cars in coming years.to date, neither satellite radio provider has yet made a profit. the companies have borrowed heavily to launch their businesses and establish costly contracts with celebrity personalities such as oprah winfrey and martha stewart, and sports franchises like major league baseball.on a stand-alone basis, analysts project that sirius will not post a profit until 2010 and xm not until 2011, according to average forecasts from reuters estimates....read more: here5/31/2007 07:27:00 am
