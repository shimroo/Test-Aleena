                                what is a multi-day event like?
                                




soldier ride is typically a four-day commitment. here’s what your experience might look like:

day 1: arrive, get fitted for your bike, and have lunch. in the evening, you’ll meet the other warriors on your ride and start setting goals for the next few days.
day 2: go for a short program ride (10-15 miles) to test out your bike, get comfortable, and start getting to know your fellow warriors and soldier ride team members.
day 3: reach and exceed your goals on a 15- to 20-mile (or longer!) ride.
day 4: enjoy a closing breakfast before you leave.







                                do i really have to bike 15-20 miles?
                                




yes. riding 15-20 miles does sound like a challenge. however, the pace of the ride is set by the slowest rider, and there are planned stops and breaks along the routes.






                                can i get involved in a soldier ride that comes to my city even if i’m not a veteran?
                                




absolutely! community members are welcome to cheer on warriors along the routes and can sponsor a water station for riders.






                                can my family member accompany me on a soldier ride?
                                




family members/caregivers may be eligible to attend on a case-by-case basis. remember, this event is to get you connected with your fellow warriors and encourage you to push yourself to recognize your potential.






                                i haven't been on a bicycle in many years or since my injury. can i keep up?
                                




yes. we ride as fast as the slowest rider. soldier ride is about building camaraderie and having fun.






                                can i bring my service animal to the event?
                                




yes; however, this is subject to wwp policy and hotel requirements.






                                how often can i attend a soldier ride event?
                                




participation in soldier ride events is based on available dates, prior participation, and event location.






                                will i be allowed to choose my event location?
                                




soldier ride participants are selected by the region in which they live. however, warriors will have an opportunity to select an event date that will align with their availability to attend and, to the extent possible, their location preference.






                                how much does it cost to attend a soldier ride event?
                                




soldier ride, like all wwp programs, is at no cost to the warrior.
