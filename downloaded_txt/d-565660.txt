welcome to hillside campgrounds

celebrating 40 magical years!
for over 40 years, hillside campgrounds has been more than just a place to stay—it’s been a home away from home for the gay male community. nestled in the quiet beauty of pennsylvania, just 30 minutes south of the new york state line, hillside offers a safe, fun, welcoming space to relax, connect, and let your true self shine.
here, the vibe is laid-back, the laughs are plentiful, and the memories…they last a lifetime!

















 
 







 
 







 
 









 
 







 
 







 
 









 
 







 
 







 
 







 
 










be free. be you. be here!
come visit hillside, a gay clothing-optional campground where you can shed the stress of the outside world (and your layers, if you like!). whether you’re soaking up the sun by the pool, meeting new friends, eating a great home cooked meal at embers cafe, joining one of many themed parties, or taking a quiet walk through the woods…hillside is all about creating a space where you feel comfortable and free to be yourself.
