mgba is an emulator for running game boy advance games. it aims to be faster and more accurate than many existing game boy advance emulators, as well as adding features that other emulators lack. it also supports game boy and game boy color games.

the project started in april 2013 with the goal of being fast enough to run on lower end hardware than other emulators support, without sacrificing accuracy or portability. even in the initial version, games generally played without problems. mgba has only gotten better since then, and now boasts being the most accurate gba emulator around.

other goals include accurate enough emulation to provide a development environment for homebrew software, a good workflow for tool-assist runners, and a modern feature set for emulators that older emulators may not support.

mgba is licensed under the mozilla public license 2.0, and the code can be found on github.

up-to-date news and more downloads can be found at mgba.io.

a new release of mgba, version 0.10.4 is available. this version is a bugfix release, which contains several important fixes. important fixes include the wii version being unable to launch in some cases, and an multiple issue with the updater. if you are running on windows and have used the installer (instead of the portable version), you will need to update manually as a bug that prevents the built-in updater from working properly has only been identified and fixed after the release of 0.10.3. this will be the last release before 0.11 unless a major issue is discovered, and may be the last release to support windows 7 – 8.1 and macos 10.9 – 10.12. an extensive list of changes follows after the cut.

the full-scale gba game jam is back after a two-year hiatus!

you have 3 months to make something cool that runs on the game boy advance, using whatever tools you like!

come join us on discord or irc for help getting started, chat with other participants (maybe even team up!) and head over to gbadev.net for useful links & resources!

the game boy advance is a wonderfully unique, fun and accessible machine to develop for. it upholds the graphical techniques of the 8/16-bit era, such as hardware-accelerated tilemaps, sprites and palettes. yet its 32-bit cpu is powerful enough that you can program for it in high level languages such as c, c++, rust, zig and nim.

this blend of capability and limitations, in addition to being highly portable and widely emulated, makes gba development a very rewarding experience!

sponsors:
incube8 games
gbdev community
insidegadgets
bitmap soft
zed labz
the retro room

join us as a sponsor, showcase your product/services and help the scene!.

prizes:
the current prize pool is $1349 and will be split among the top ranked entries (details). anyone can contribute by donating.

the top 3 winners will also receive a gbxcart rw courtesy of insidegadgets!

rules:
1. your submission must include a .gba file! you can also attach screenshots, readmes, game manuals, etc.

2. it should run on real hardware or an accurate emulator such as mgba or nanoboyadvance.

3. ports from other platforms are allowed, emulated games are not.

4. it must feature a substantial amount of new & original work (i.e. not something you were already working on for months).

5. only use code and assets that you have explicit permission to use, giving appropriate credit.

6. no nsfw or offensive content.

by fleroviux [sunday may 26th 08:21:59 utc 2024]
tools : emulator

permalink




nanoboyadvance is a cycle-accurate game boy advance emulator.
it aims to be as accurate as possible, while also offering enhancements such as improved audio quality.

features:
• very high compatibility and accuracy (see accuracy)
• hq audio mixer (for games which use nintendo's musicplayer2000 sound engine)
• post-processing options (color correction, xbrz upscaling and lcd ghosting simulation)
• save state support (10x save slots available)
• game controller support (buttons and axises can be remapped)
• loading roms from archives (zip, 7z, tar and limited rar support)
• rtc emulation
• solar sensor emulation (for example: for boktai - the sun is in your hand)
• debug tools: ppu palette, tile, background and sprite viewers

running:
download a recent development build or the last stable release.

upon loading a rom for the first time you will be prompted to assign the game boy advance bios file.
you can dump it from a real console (accurate) or use an unofficial bios (less accurate).

accuracy:
a lot of research and attention to detail has been put into developing this core and making it accurate.

• cycle-accurate emulation of most components, including: cpu, dma, timers, ppu and game pak prefetch
• passes all ags aging cartridge tests (nba was the first public emulator to achieve this)
• passes most tests in the mgba test suite (see mgba suite comparison for more details)
• passes armwrestler, gba-suite and fuzzarm cpu tests
• very high compatibility, including games that require emulation of peculiar hardware edge-cases (see game compatibility)

compiling:
see compiling.md in the docs folder.

acknowledgements:
• martin korth: for gbatek, a good piece of hardware documentation.
• endrift: for prior research and hardware tests.
• destoer, noumi, zayd and sky: for hardware research and tests, countless discussions and being good friends.
• pokefan531 and hunterk: for the default gba color correction algorithm
• talarubi and near: for higan's gba color correction algorithm
• desmume team and hyllian: xbrz upscaling code

changelog:
• ui: implement an option to pause the emulator when the window is inactive
• ui: improve lack of response to input changes in the sprite viewer when the emulator is paused
• ui: replace qopenglwidget with qwidget (thanks @granminigun)
• ui: fix solar sensor level menu that has been broken in 1.8.0 (fixes #370)
• gpio: fix broken deserialization of port directions
• apu: mp2k hle: handle corrupted wave info addresses (fixes #362)
• apu: psg l/r volume must be remapped from 0-7 to 1-8
• gamedb: japanese boktai releases have a solar sensor (thanks @raphaelr)
• redirect stdout on windows (thanks @granminigun)download: nanoboyadvance-1.8.1-win64.zip

watch the full youtube video to learn more about this on my channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/3dsage

i have been working a long time to code the fastest 3d game engine i could on the gba. and this is just the game running. the next version will have the grid and ui so you can create your own custom levels just like i show in the video!

thank you for your support! let me know what you think of this in the video comments! i will be reading and responding. and let me know what you want me to add or adjust for the next version! thank you for your support!
(the save file must be next to the rom. if you use a flashcart, place the save file in the proper folder)

pump it up gba v1.8.4

a pump it up emulator for the game boy advance that uses stepmania ssc charts.

features:
• full .ssc support (including hold/fake notes, bpm/scroll changes, stop/delays, warps)
• several game modes (campaign, arcade, impossible)
• multiplayer support via link cable / wireless adapter
• dynamic speed multipliers
• multiple mods
• hardware integrations (rumble, sram/io led sync)
• ~70 songs per .gba rom

new features:
• added a new challenge mode when completing the campaign mode
• arcade modes now store dance grades by index instead of by level. this allows saving different scores for charts that have the same numeric level (e.g. s19-a, s19-b)

misc. changes:
• stage break = death will now display the life bar at minimum level and ignore bads in the judgement phase
• now the game remembers the page/song when switching between campaign and the challenge (e.g. impossible) modes
• bubbles in the home screen will 'regenerate' when leaving a submenu
• removed pixel blinking effect from the home screen

optimizations:
• now charts use static ewram to prevent crashes due to allocation failures
• updated gba-link-connection to v6.0.3, which fixes potential autopairing issues (e.g. two couples trying to create two separate sessions via wireless adapter)

bugfixes:
• fixed a small memory leak after playing a song
• fixed a bug with the random number generator that was causing the last value of a range to be ignored
• fixed a glitch where the user could enter the "audio lag" option and navigate to the previous/next option during the transition
• (v1.8.1) added small fixes and adjustments to the new challenge mode
• (v1.8.2) the wireless adapter is now put in low consumption mode when not in use
• (v1.8.3) general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience
• (v1.8.3) fixed rate = +1 mod in impossible mode (v1.8.0 regression)
• (v1.8.3) fixed 'mark as defective' combo being enabled during challenge mode
• (v1.8.3) the challenge mode now displays the current song
• (v1.8.3) if the arcade library matches the selected difficulty level of the campaign mode (most common case), the game now remembers the selected song when switching between modes
• (v1.8.3) the importer is now provided as a portable windows executable
• (v1.8.4) huh... all this time prefetch was disabled. well, free performance boost!
• (v1.8.4) the sprite limit was increased from 50 to 90
• (v1.8.4) the bounce mod now uses a slightly less aggressive curve
