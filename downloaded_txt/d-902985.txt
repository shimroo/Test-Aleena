the road to emmaus(these quotations are from the 19 tapes of billy paulâ€˜s dream)the revelation of jesus christ jeffersonville in 60-1204m 159revelation chapter onerojc 9-67and this great thing that's fixing to happen, will carry over to revelation 11 and pick up those two prophets, elijah and a moses returning back again for the jews. we're ready for it. everything's setting in order, just ready. this gentile message, as the jews brought it to the gentiles, the gentiles will take it right back to the jews again. and the rapture will come.and as soon as the gentile church is taken away, then he makes hisself known to israel. see? that's right.so the rapture will come before the tribulation sets in.and you're looking for the water to turn into blood and things like that; that comes over to israel again, back yonder with moses and elijah. when they return, elijah for the fourth time, returns back. and the spirit... neither of those was dead; or moses died; they didn't know where they buried him. he was bound to be raised up somewhere between then and there, because on the mount transfiguration, there he was talking to jesus, him and moses. see?so they'll come back and be killed, and lay in the spiritual street called sodom where our lord was crucified, jerusalem. that'll be preached to the jews. and smite the earth and close the heavens and so forth like that... and the end of the gentile ministry will carry over and connect with that, and the gentiles will go home, and that ministry will go on. there'll be the doom of all things. two-thirds of the earth fell and everything else. when them dead bodies laid in the streets three days, watch what kind it was.the patmos vision jeffersonville in 60-1204e 160john's patmos visionrojc 69-130remember, keep this in mind: all that god was he poured into christ (he was the fullness of the godhead bodily), and all that christ was he poured into the church: god above us, god with us, god in us, the triunity of god, god manifested in three different manners: father, son, holy spirit.you sell out to the world, the things of the world, and everything that pertains to anything else, to have this. that's right, put your whole anchor right on that. it's the anchor of the soul to see his revelation of his word.then if the bible plainly reveals that jesus was the almighty god, then woe unto him that will take it away from there. yeah. it's a revelation. whosoever shall add anything... it's the complete canon of revelation; it's god's last book, his last word, his last... and any revelation that comes contrary to that, is of a false prophecy; it isn't god, 'cause this is truth.when a man really comes to christ, he's got his eyes centered on christ. if he's a little bit emotional, he'll be a fanatic. if he's a little bit cold, he'll get on this other side and be just a cucumber, over on that side (see?), his intellectual. but the main thing is right in the middle of the road, with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving (amen.), and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit, and move just as the spirit moves, not till or not after; just as the spirit moves.john was carried in the spirit over into the lord's day. this is the day of man, but the day of the lord shall come.the holy ghost took their lives over, and ceased from their worldly things.we which have entered into his rest has ceased from all worldly doings as god did on the day of his creation; he entered into his rest, and we enter in with him as our worldly works is through.christmas is a day of worship.and by the way, christ wasn't born on the twenty-fifth day of december either. he couldn't have been. if you'd ever been in judaea, the hills are full of snow, worse than it is here: he born in april when all nature comes forth.when they come into that and receive the holy ghost, then they're finished with the world and the things of the world.transmitted to see what was just beyond the curtain... he let me come back to tell you that beyond there we're not spooks and spirits; we're men and women, young, never die, never get sick, just beyond the veil. death can do no more to you than pull you right into that place.now, this is a man's day, man's doings, man's works, man's church, man's ideas, but the day of the lord is coming.a voice, as... a trumpet,now, a trumpet always announces the approaching of something.john got in the spirit and he heard a trumpet. he heard a trumpet, and he turned to look what was behind him when he heard the trumpet, after he got into the spirit.he was in the spirit.i believe he was having a good time in the spirit, just praising god; because that's exactly what happened when the spirit fell on them at the first place.that's the way they acted the first time. so the spirit come on again, he probably acted the same way. see? there's nothing new about this--this thing; this is an old-time religion.the greatest of all the revelations is the deity, the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ.the first thing you have to know is the deity of christ. "i am alpha and omega. i'm from a to z; there's no more but me. i was at the beginning; i'll be at the end. i'm he that was, which is, and shall come, the almighty." think of it. that's what the trumpet said.just a little later we watch him in his sevenfold personage, watch what he is then.all right, the first of all revelations is the supreme deity of jesus christ. you must know who he is when you hear the voice (all right.), the same voice that sounded on mount sinai, the same voice that sounded on mount transfiguration, the same one, one like the son of man."jesus christ the same yesterday, today, and forever," the same fire, holy ghost, lit every one of those churches right down through the ages.that tree ever brings forth another vine, it'll be the same kind of a vine it brought on the day of pentecost: the original vine. it'll speak in tongues and have power and the signs of the resurrected christ in it. why? 'cause it's thriving of the natural resource that it's planted in. actually, it's not planted in it; it's borned in it. glory. oh, my. didn't think of that one right then.but if they're borned in that same life that come out of that tree, that's the only thing they can bear, is the life of the original stem.one of these days i'll bring up and show you israel had seven church ages too, and typed exactly with these.now, notice, before jesus returns to the earth... now, this is a little ahead of time, but the spirit of elijah will return back to the earth and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. the bible said so. jesus saw him here; the apostles saw him here, the order of the coming of the son of man glorified. he's to be glorified and coming back. the first thing, before they saw him, was what? elijah. then what? moses; israel returning yonder, the law-keepers, and then the glorified son of man. hallelujah. do you see the order of his coming? the spirit of elijah, or the witness of the last church age (see?), coming in power to manifest him.then a hundred and forty-four thousand jews to gather on mount sinai... where israel has become a nation itself, the oldest nation in the world, the oldest flag in the world: has their own nation, their own flag, their own army, their own money, and everything else. they are one of the members of the leagues of the nations, because they are a nation. jesus said they should never be cast away until all things is fulfilled.the time is at hand, even at the door. verily i say unto you, this generation shall not pass until all these things be fulfilled."there will come moses and elijah. oh. hope you get it.amen. cut every obstacle from human beings, that they might be connected like in the garden of eden. now, man... i was going to choke it, but i'm going to say it. man is omnipotent. you don't believe that, but he is. a man that's fully surrendered to god is omnipotent. did not he say in mark 11:22, "whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart, it'll come to pass. you can have what you've said"?what happens when two omnipotence meet? when god and man comes together through omnipotence, something's got to shake. some... whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of god, knowing that he's promised it, and he said it in his word, it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass; things that is not, it makes them as though they are, because two omnipotence have met. there he stands. oh, isn't he wonderful.the ephesian church age jeffersonville in 60-1205 138rojc 131-183if life come by man, death come by the woman. all right, she was the tree of death.now, we've got a hydrogen bomb. god don't destroy nothing; man destroys himself by his knowledge.the smyrnaean church age jeffersonville in 60-1206 113rojc 185-227and they were to be faithful to the gospel unto death. did you notice in a marriage ceremony, "not until death do we part," but "unto death do we part." see? now, "unto" and "until" is different. now, they was to be faithful to christ unto death. "go right on down to death with it. don't be afraid, for i'll give you a crown."a day in the bible represents a year.every part of it laps over in every church, the churches.)... spirit says to the churches; he that overcometh... (in what church? ephesian? yeah. all right. smyrna? yeah, all of them)... he that overcomes... (in all the churches)... shall not be hurt of the second death.my little boy there, joseph, is part of me, no matter what i--he'd ever do. he... i might... he might not have... if i was a great rich man and had a lot of inheritance, he might even inherits anything; but still he's a son; he's part of me. sure, he's part of me. now, i can no more deny him than i can deny myself, because he's part of me. the blood test would show that he's mine. see?and the blood test shows whether you're god's or not. see? you're god's children and you have eternal life. but the soul that sinneth, that soul shall be separated. that right? then it will be no more. now, look. anything that had a beginning has an end, because anything that had a beginning is a creation. but god was not created; he was always god.now, while we sing this next verse, i want you to shake hands, like you do each night, all the methodist, and baptist, and presbyterian. shake hands with one another, and even be friendly enough to chew each other's chewing gum, if you can. now, just be real, real friendly, being sociable now while we sing it.the pergamean church age jeffersonville in 60-1207 160rojc 229-285then what are we going to do when we get down to the laodicean church age (see?), where we're at now, and the woes and things pronounced to get in it?now, if he is the living word, then this wrote on the bible is part of him; then if you can receive this into him, which is the word, this word comes into you by faith makes it alive, because the... oh, catch that. the word comes into you, if the holy spirit's in there, it's alive as soon as it comes in, and every promise is true. nothing... "therefore, if you say to this mountain 'be moved,' and don't doubt in your heart." because what? you are deity speaking. you believe it? the bible said so. and whatever you say shall come to pass if you'll not doubt, if you can get all of the--the world bred out of you, let the holy spirit make you a full son or daughter of god (no world, no condemnation, no doubt). what is it then? it's no more you; it's god in you. then you take his word; it's a promise, and say, "father, it's your promise." "satan..." something's got to move. see, see?now, you can't do that until god has revealed to you then what that case should be. see? then when you know what that case shall be, then you can say, like jesus... he was the word. is that right? and yet jesus, the man, the tabernacle, said, "i do nothing except the father shows me first.""hidden manna." let's give the interpretation the best we can. what does hidden manna type? hidden manna was a manna that was kept in the place--or a showbread, in the bible, that was only for the priest. how many knows that? see? now, it wasn't for... they had a bread for the congregation, but there was a special bread for the priest. is that right?this is a special bread, a special bread, hidden manna. what is it? who is our manna? christ. all right, saint john the 6th chapter, 48th to the 50th verse, if you're putting it down, jesus said he was, "the bread of life that come from god out of heaven," the manna.well, what is the hidden manna? the manna that isn't given to all of the congregation. the revelation is poured out upon the angel of the church, the revelation of the word (see?), revelation of the word is given to the angel of that age, for it's hid from everywhere, and revealed back (the hidden manna) to... it's addressed to the angel of the church. see? you get it? it's a little bigger revelation of what christ is, maybe a little higher call.but they was the one who had the signs following.they don't want great big things, and great big something; they want to be humble, that humility. the way--the way up is down. "he that humbles himself shall be exalted; he that exalts himself shall be abased." humbled himself... don't try to be a big something; try to be a little something, but be what you are. see? be little in the sight of god; be little in your own sight; everybody else is above you. "lets him's the greatest among you be minister to all."who could be greater than jesus christ who girded himself and washed the disciples' feet? a foot washing flunkya real great man tries to make you think you're great and he's nothing. see?now, white rock, he shall have a white rock, this angel shall have. a white stone, that's a rock, isn't it? and a... that's right, purity.he--he met a man one time and his name was simon, and he changed his name to rock, "peter." why? he had the keys. is that right? he changed his name and made him a rock. is that right? peter had the keys, because he was the one who had the keys to the kingdom."a new name, a new name written in this rock that nobody knows but he himself." he knows who he is, but he can't tell others. see, see? no one knows but himself. see? peter knows he had the keys, but you didn't hear him bragging about it. see? these guys who brag about what they are is usually nothing. "a white rock, and in it a new name," not his own name, but he's somebody else (see?) that only he himself knows (he that's got the rock, the name). see, special manna to feed the church, remember."hidden manna, a stone, a new name that no man knows but he himself," and it was addressed to the angel of the church. i wonder if luther knowed that? i wonder if wesley knowed it? i wonder if--if the other great angels?and i wonder today, if in... coming in the world soon, the great angel of light that'll come to us, that'll lead us out, a great holy spirit come in power, and will lead us to the lord jesus christ. he probably won't know it, but he'll be here some of these days. he'll make... god will make him known. he won't have to make himself known; god will make him known. god will prove his own. that's what he said when jesus was here and they didn't know him. see? he said, "if i do not the works of my father, then don't believe me; but if i do the works of my father, and you can't believe me, then believe the works." is that right?the thyatirean church age jeffersonville in 60-1208 100rojc 287-327he taught that signs of mark 16 should follow every believer. amen. i... that's the kind of guy i like, believers. yes, sir.and in this stone was a name, a name that no one knowed but the one who received it himself. he knew it, but no one else could know it but him. when you hear these guys flatter you, telling there's--they're john, they're paul, they're mary, they're this, that, or the other. don't you believe it, 'cause if it was, he'd never say nothing about it. see? that's right. he has to keep it to hisself. he knowed; no one knowed but he himself, but he knowed because every perfect overcomer receives a new name in that--in that--that way.did you notice abraham was called abram, but when god went to use him, he changed his name to abraham. s-a-r-r-a was sarra, but when god was going to use her, he changed her name to s-a-r-r-a-h: sarah, "princess." did you notice jacob? "jacob" was "supplanter." esau means "red, hairy and red"; red-headed, and red all over, is esau. now, and jacob was "supplanter." and "supplanter" is a "deceiver." didn't esau say, "isn't his name called jacob, 'supplanter'?" but when he wrestled with the lord all night long, and overcome, and was blessed, god changed his name: jacob, israel, "a prince with god." paul was called saul until he met the holy spirit in the form of a light that shined down upon him; his name was changed from saul to paul. simon, when he met jesus, he changed his name to peter. that...and when jesus overcome, his name was changed. and he would reveal that name, "he that would be with him, overcome as he has, he received a new name; and i'll reveal my new name to him." see? and every overcomer, i mean, among such as that, them leaders and so forth. now, all the children of israel didn't get their name changed, of course. that's right. but those high leaders, when they overcome, they had received a new name. see how it dovetails in just perfectly?and now, we find out that he also got hidden manna. now, hidden manna is typed to the shewbread. the shewbread was for priests alone. that is right. shewbread was just for the priest. and they... it was a special thing made for the priest, that is, the leaders; and this man overcome. the whole congregation got manna, but he got a hidden special manna, or special revelation, oh, of who jesus was, and what about him, all about him. see, he got that revelation if he had overcome. to the angel, "hold fast, for he that..." he had overcome... addressed to the angel of the church... see?another thing, he was not priest then, 'cause the priest was tied around the middle, means service. but he was tied around the paps, up here, which meant that he was a judge. amen. and we see him walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.god said, "now, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, elijah. (uh-huh.) i done got seven hundred hid out around in yonder. see? you don't know where they're at. they're out there, the pharisees, sadducees, baptists, methodists, and presbyterians, but i--i'll get them out of there;the sardisean church age jeffersonville in 60-1209 113rojc 329-372and as we overcome by the holy spirit like he had, we will set with him as he takes the earthly throne of david, to set and rule with him just like he did up there (amen.) with power and authority over all the earth. "and the--the earth is groaning, waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god to be manifested, god's sons."because after all, this world was not given for god to control. let's notice. that's right. who is the god of the earth? man. that's his domain. all, everything in the earth is subject to the man. through sin he fell; through christ's redeeming power he comes back again (that's right.), because the earth belongs to man, it was given to him, and he was ruler over everything. and all nature's groaning, waiting for that time that when the sons of god will be manifested again. oh, my. manifestations of the sons of god... now, we'd better leave that right now.see, even nature bears record of these three right there. nature itself, god in the beginning made it so it would be that way. you don't even have to have the bible; you can look at nature and see where you're at. see?but it failed in the church and the restoration of bringing forth the reform; it failed to restore back full gospel teaching with signs following. the lutheran church never did have it. they never had it; and they never had it in the wesleyan age. they only had it down at the end of this laodicean age.the philadelphian church age jeffersonville in 60-1210 124rojc 373-423and then we seen it was almost stamped out, and he called that same age, a dead age, dark, so forth. and then come out just a little light, then a little more strength, and then went into the pentecostal (real experience) again right at the end time; and then the bride caught away, and away it went; and the tribulation set back in again (all right), the great tribulation which is coming up before all the world.and i said, "i can't help you. but if you'll accept this jesus who is here now, who knows your life and knows all about you, he'll help you."she said, "i accept jesus as my saviour."that did it. that was it. ten thousand mohammedans come to christ that afternoon. see? about thirty years on the mission field, and it turned one over by literature, where in five minutes time ten thousand come by the gospel being made manifest.and nobody's got a business going to the fields unless they have received the holy ghost and preaching the power of demonstrations, 'cause it's the only thing that'll--that'll move those people.his entire church is built upon divine revelations of himself.now, what was god showing abraham what he was going to do? that he was going to take abraham's seed, through isaac down to jesus, and he took him up on calvary, and there he tore him apart. he tore the spirit out of him, away from the body; he raised up the body and set it on the right hand of the majesty on high, and sent back the holy spirit to the church. that's the covenant of god, tore it apart: we got the spirit; he's got the body. and when it comes back together, the spirit that was in us joins with him as bride. amen. not any denomination hooked into it at all. no, sir. it's purely unadulterated, holy spirit birth. that's all. that's the covenant.what is a--what is a jew? a spirit, holy ghost-filled christian. i know that you're down here after that age of sanctification that say they got the holy ghost, but... he said it; i never. they said they had the holy ghost without the signs following, but he said they are liars. "these signs shall follow them that believe." can't make him lie. oh, brother. that blinds you around, around. see? oh, my.right here it'd have to break in on me in the morning's message. that's the sleeping virgin right there. can you see it? when was it at? at the end time. oh, when they went out... here is the... see? they are justified by faith, sanctified: justified through luther's message, sanctified through here, but missed the open door. you see it? justified by faith through luther; sanctified through wesley's age...many of them precious nazarene, pilgrim holiness, wesleyan methodist, and so forth, all of them live a good, clean life, sanctified, and think it's got the holy ghost; and hear a fellow speak in tongues, or something, they'll laugh at him, make fun of him, and say it's of the devil. brother, you've sealed your doom when you did that. you blasphemed the holy ghost, which is unpardonable."them synagogues is of satan." oh, my. did it strike? they are synagogues of satan. that's judas pretending to be a christian.what was judas' main thing? was money. the biggest pull of a lot of these things today is money. look at the assemblies of god, building six-million-dollar building over here, and teaching the lord's coming right away. oh, the bombs is in the hangars to blow us away, and build a six-million-dollar building. oh, my. well, rich and have need... we get that tomorrow night now, the lord willing.and he gave them power against unclean spirits, to go out and have healing services, and cast out devils, and--and to do all kinds of miracles. and when they returned back, judas with them...but when it come to pentecost he showed his colors.but this little place right in here, that's been the last thirty-five, forty years, has been an open door setting right before the people to come in, and god will take the remnant and seal it off. and they'll go on into a lukewarm, and he'll spurt them out of his mouth. the work will be cut short, up goes the church, and here comes the antichrist moving in for destruction. just perfect, fits with the whole bible right on around. all right. now.but are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone;that's like, in type, the tribe of levi: all the rest of them paid tithes to him (you see?); from one new moon to another, one sabbath to another, they went up to worship.him the name of my god,...name of god? jesus.i'll put on him the name of the city of my god,"the city," he goes ahead and say, "which is the new jerusalem (see?), the new jerusalem. i'll put on him the new jerusalem." now, the bride, or the church, is the new jerusalem. how many knows that? the church itself is the new jerusalem. you believe that?the bible said, "prove all things.new city of his (god's name) is.and i john saw the holy city, the new jerusalem, coming down from god out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.the new--new church is the gentile church, the bride. the bride is a gentile, and the gentile has his name. he took a people out of the gentiles for his name's sake. you believe that?the gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.and i will write upon him the name of my god, and the name of the city of my god... (which is all the same: jesus, jesus, jesus: the bride married to jesus, makes it mrs. jesus, and so forth. see?)and i will write upon him my new name.i better leave that alone, hadn't i? all right. notice, "him" there is singular. now, if you'll go back to revelation 2:17 just a minute, just review it just a second:he that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth save he that receives it.you know, i love to sing in the spirit after a meeting where you had--that's cutting and everything. don't you? oh, how i love to get in the spirit then. the word (see?), the word's fallen now; now only thing it needs is some moisturein this age, deceived, that there's nothing else in the world left for us, lord. there's nothing left for the world; it's--it's--it's at the end time. we see by the bible, every age has gone. we're now in the end, going out swiftly. it won't be long till jesus will be coming. o god, set our hearts afire; don't let us stand still. i think, what would great saint paul do if he was here tonight and would see the things the way they are? how that he... that man, they'd have him in jail before daylight; he would be out here telling the people to make ready the coming of the lord.the ten virgins, and the hundred and forty-four thousand jews jeffersonville in 60-1211m 168rojc 425-492soon i might have another little series of meetings upon the true and false church, all the way from genesis, take it through the bible and sweep it right down through revelations:and now you can look in the "look" magazine, and "life" and them, showing the pictures of them returning back. didn't jesus say it, "when you see the fig tree putting forth its buds"? jews has always been the fig tree. "this generation shall not pass until all these things be fulfilled." and now, they're already back, already a nation, already got their own money, their own flag, and everything, and is recognized in the u.n.; they are a nation. she's settled. she's ready. now, ready for what? the sealing of the hundred and forty-four thousand (now, we'll get to that just in a minute.) of israel; them jews, not the wall street bunch that's always cheated and stole and everything else; i mean real jews, clearly true jews that keep the commandments of god down there.now, the real jews are gathering into palestine again, and just exactly what the prophet said; as ishmael and isaac were at one another's throats, always fighting, predicted they'd be there in the last day, and there they set. ishmael out here, and about a city block here and here's isaac, and both of them (mohammedans and jews) a-fighting one another in a no-man's-land.now, to see whether this message that we got is connected with it or not. the very hour that israel was signed in to be a nation; it was the very same hour, very same day, very same month, everything else: i was at green's mill, indiana, when that angel there appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this; after he had met me down on the river and told me what would take place, then commissioned me eleven years later at the same hour that israel was signed in as a nation. it's all connected together.become to destruction, holding the atomic, holding the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing comes to destroy it; until israel returns back and gets herself together; and then the message will go to israel, and she'll be sealed with that seal of the holy ghost. see? after the gentiles is called out the people for his name's sake will be called out, which in this age right here they're called. then israel only receives a three-year-and-six-month's message.elijah and moses returns again and preach to the jews: two men anointed with that spirit, or maybe them theirself; they never died. so they kill them, and they lay them in the street called sodom where our lord was crucified: jerusalem. and after three days, why, the life, spirit of life came into them, and they went up, raised up. and then about a third of the earth was blowed to pieces at that time. they done miracles and signs with the jews.now, here's that jews that they're coming to preach to. the world cannot--could not blow one another up, or kill one another, or destruction come, until those jews come back down on that place; here sets the bible saying so; he saw the four angels. and watch what they got to receive? they've got to receive the holy ghost just like they did...and they cannot do nothing now until those jews return. and just a few weeks ago they classed the whole thing together and become in the u.n... it's ready. we're at the end; everything's sealed up now.now, now watch, to prove that they are jews, now, i'm going to take the...saying, hurt not the earth, neither the sea, or any tree, until we have sealed the servants of our god in their forehead.and i looked, and lo, a lamb stood on... mount sinai, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his father's name written in their forehead.but one of these days the message will go to israel, and what will break for... god will send unto them moses and elijah of revelations 11, and they will do signs and wonders, and jehovah's sign; while the gentiles is finished, the grace of--day of grace will leave the gentile church; the pentecostal age will leave. the denominations will continue on, because they come up here with the sleeping virgin (we will go into that just in a moment.), but they will come up in that class.but then when they do, when they do that, the jews will receive the baptism of the holy ghost, and there'll be a revival there that'll stop the heavens in the days of... "don't rain." they'll do all kinds of signs and miracles. and finally the roman hierarchy... the jews has the wealth of the world, and--and so the roman catholic church will break his agreement with the jews after this thing is over, and then there will... (the treaty that they got signed between them), he'll go down there, and then's when god will stand like he did in the old days there, and fight for israel. they'll finally kill these two prophets, and they'll lay in the street, and spit on them, like they did these pentecostal minister and his wife and children here a few weeks ago down there, and the little belly swelled up that big, of the children, where they walked by, and spit on them, and let them lay in that hot sun for three or four days without burying them.they'll do the same thing. the bible said so. they'll do the same thing right there. and when they do that, after three days, laying dead, the spirit of life will come into those two prophets, and they'll rise up and ascend into glory. and about that time, the fireworks starts then. that's the end time. that's when she's over.it will be a secret coming; no one will know when it's going to happen. we're commanded to be ready and watching. we don't know what hour. but whatever it is, we will not prevent any of these back in here; for just as soon as jesus appears, the whole watch rises. dead or alive, doesn't matter.we don't--we don't meet him first; we meet one another first. the bible said, ephesians 5th chapter, it said, "for we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord (down here) shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep."first we're going to meet one another. oh--oh--oh. no wondering about it, we're all there.no wonder they stood and said, "amen, glory, and wisdom, and honor, and power, and might...""six days he labored, and the seventh he resteth," that's complete (see?), seven. six days he's labored in the world. first two thousand years it was destroyed by water; second two thousand years, christ come; and this is the third two thousand now. at the end of every two thousand, something happens; the world is shook back again. in the six thousand years he built the world; six thousand years the church labors against the world; and the seventh thousand is that thousand years millennium reign. understand it now?israel had a brass serpent, a smitten rock, the joy of the king, divine healing, prophets, everything right down here. and they did not; they had the ritual but out--without the blessing, the oil.and the bible said that god raised up communism to get revenge upon the nations for what they've done to the children of god. exactly right. he said, "and they--they--they give their power and everything to the beast for one hour, and to revenge the people, the... of the blood that they had shed." and when that atomic bomb or whatever it is will strike that vatican city, and the roman hierarchy will be no more, it said, "and in her was found the blood of every martyr that ever was killed in the world." there she is. and here's the image to it, a confederation of churches.now, that doesn't mean you... he takes and puts a spot up there. your forehead is your revelation (see?), and your hand is the thing you do about it. see, it's a spiritual mark. see? he don't take a big stamp and stamp you like that. oh, no.and now, remember, there's only one hundred and forty-four thousand of the jews sealed, which was the remnant of the jews left over. but in this, in the gentile bride--in the gentile bride there was tens of thousands times thousands of those that's sealed in there, 'cause that's them martyrs and things that come down through the ages there; they'll rise in the day of the judgment.the laodicean church age jeffersonville in 60-1211e 147rojc 493-550now, watch the compound coming of elijah. now, if you'll notice, all scripture has a compound meanings. "but it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and revealed to babes such as will learn." don't you believe that? now, hold malachi 4 right there.revelation, chapter four #1 jeffersonville in 60-1231 90rojc 551-584any time you see a trumpet blow in a war--in the bible time, its sounding meant a war, either a revelation or something to take place.the first thing he saw in the coming was moses: represented the dead saints that would be resurrected. elijah was standing there.oh, that trumpet voice of christ summonedwhat is a trumpet? the voice of christ, the same one sounded and summoned him up. he heard the voice like a trumpet sound and said, "come up hither." see how the resurrection will be? it'll be in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. that clear sounding voice, and he'll summons the church, calling, "come out of it." that great summonsing voice, god, help me to hear it that day.when the bible comes, the words of god, every word of god is a trumpet. every sound of the word is a trumpet, the gospel trumpet.moses brought in the resurrection, and elijah brought in the raptured group. and there, both of them was represented right there.and after while they noticed then, and they seen, and peter said, "let's build three tabernacles. let some go under the law, and let some go under elijah, and let's go (some of them) this way."and while they were yet speaking, a voice spoke and said, "this is my beloved son; hear ye him." and when they looked, they seen jesus only, everything had wilted into one. oh, and he was the light, the truth, the way, the door, the rainbow.oh, tomorrow we got a great lesson, the lord willing. tomorrow we take the judgments; we take the sardine stone, see what it represents, what part it played. and we take the--the--the jasper, and we take the--oh, all the different stones, and we take these all down through ezekiel, back into genesis, back over to revelations, come down in the middle of the bible, tie it together, these different stones and colors, and so forth. and then we bring it right straight back to that and see if that ain't right. see? see if it ain't the same color and everything, just the same thing. and the same holy spirit, the same god, showing the same signs, same wonders, doing the same thing just as he promised...revelation, chapter four #2 jeffersonville in 61-0101 15024 eldersrojc 585-643everything just points... everything you can look at always falls right back in the line of jesus christ, doesn't it?there we seen them representing those who died, moses to represent the dead saints, rose. elijah, with his group at the last day, with his raptured group standing therethat what man calls mighty and great, god calls foolish. and what man calls foolish, god calls great. don't forget that (see?); don't forget it. that'll help you along in the years to come, because we're looking for something greater all the time. and we're receiving greater all the time, but the peoples of the world don't know it. neither did they know it in the days of noah; neither did they know it in the days of john, in the days of jesus, in the days of the apostles, in the days of irenaeus, any of those days; they never knew it."are you a christian?""oh, i'm a methodist. i'm presbyterian. i'm pentecostal." that isn't in it at all.so remember, what looks big to men, is little before god.there john stood and seen him setting on the throne, and he was to look like jasper and sardine stone. now, all things and every word has a meaning in the bible. now, jasper and sardine stone...now, if you'll notice, it compares with the rest of the scripture. in the back parts of the scripture, he was alpha, omega, he was the beginning and the ending, he was the first and the last, he was father, son, and holy ghost. he was all, and all was bundled in him. matthew 17 shows that, up in the mount transfiguration, it was all gathered in him.now, jasper was a--was a stone, and sardine was a stone. (now, we'll get to their colors after a bit.) now, i want you to notice that each one of the patriarchs when they were born, yeah, every person has a birthstone. mine, i was born in april: diamond. and different months represents different stones. well, the patriarchs was the same. every time that a patriarch, when he was born, he had a birthstone.and just to stop right here just a moment. when them hebrew mothers... let me show you a divine word, friends, so that your faith will be built certain in the word of god. every time them hebrew mothers, when they were in labor, giving labor pains to born--birth these children, the very words that she uttered in her birth give the man (the baby that was born of her) his name, and positionally placed him in palestine where he'll be at the coming of the lord. the labor pains in this mother... like, "ephraim" means "by the sea." see? and ephraim was given his lot by the sea. and, say, judah meant... i don't know what the word means, but i could pick it out. now, see, that's where i don't have time, these short things, to pick those things up. but then go back, and judah, wherever judah means, meant's his position placed among the children of israel.and take at genesis 48 and 49, you'll find out there that jacob, when he was dying, leaning on his staff, blinded, he positionally told those children where they would be at the end of the world. and they're positionally set right there now since they've went back to the homeland. told joseph, "thou art a fruitful vine by the wall (see?) by the well," the water. he went over. said, "you've trusted in the lord god. you made your--your bough strong (united states. see?) in the lord, but someday that vine was coming back over the wall." and there she is, right there now. just exactly what he said pretty near three thousand years ago, turning right back. told ephraim he had dipped his feet in oil, and ephraim settled right there where the big oil wells are. just exactly.the utterance of those people, what was on those mortals? god taking their fibers and moving in them.looked like when the roman empire scattered them, when others scattered them, when they was hated by hitler, tens of thousands times thousands he shot bubbles in their veins and they died; you could see their bodies hanging on fences with their babies and everything else, and bones... and took and made fertilize out of their bones. just take them out there and give them a shot, put them in the wagon. then get out, time they get out near the start, they was singing, "messiah will come and we'll drink the blood of the grape again." when they went down, dying, them jews, walking around there, knowing in a few little beats and their heart would be gone. and down they'd go, singing, "we will see the messiah soon." oh, my. making fertilize out of their bones...a lot of you soldiers in here know that; you seen it. i stood on the grounds where they burned them and everything else, there, hitler and them. and look up at stalin and russia and all them done the same thing. that's right. but that jew, what was the matter? he was forced back to his homeland. there's where they're standing.i got that great film, "three minutes before midnight." when them jews come in, it was asked them, said, "why you coming back for, to die in the homeland?"said, "we've come to see the messiah." amen. um. we're at the end time.each one of those children when they were born, they had a birthstone. and when aaron, the high priest over each one of those children, had a breastplate on him, his dress. that's what i want to hold off just a little longer, to get into this 6th verse, because that brings in every symbol of the old testament right into there. every... all the furniture and everything in the old testament was a pattern of that was seen in heaven, patterned back to the human being.and here's aaron's breastplate, he the high priest... notice, the birthstone of each tribe was represented in there. one of the birthstones, put his stone in there, the tribe of ephraim, the tribe of manasses, the tribe of gad, the tribe of benjamin, all was represented in here. and that's how... then they take those birthstones, them pretty gems, and hang it on the post like this. and if a prophet prophesied, and if they saw it light up... they taken him down to this urim thummim and let him tell his prophecy; if there's a sacred light come on there and begin to flash these stones together, it was god speaking back. it was for the whole tribe, all of them, every tribe.now, on these, the first stone... the first, how many knows who the first child was? what was his name? reuben. all right. who was the last one? benjamin. that's right. the birthstone of reuben was jasper; the birthstone of benjamin was sardine. he was to look upon as reuben and benjamin, the first and the last, he that was, which is, and shall come. he was alpha (a) in the greek alphabet, omega (z) in the greek alphabet. he was the first, the last; he was from benjamin to reuben, from reuben to benjamin. oh, my. there he was, "look upon as sardius stone and as jasper stone." he was setting on this throne.how would you all like to see him setting upon his glory? let's turn over in revelation 21:10, right quick, and just take a look at him here. all right, 21:10 to 11.and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the holy jerusalem, descending out of heaven from god,having the glory of god:... having the glory of god: and her lights was like unto a stone most precious, even like jasper, as clear as crystal;her light... the light. who is the light?and the city had no need of the sun,... because the lamb is the light thereof.jasper, sardius stone: the glory of god is jesus christ; the glory of jesus christ is his church. and he was the first. what was he? he was the beginning of time; he is the ending of time. he was the first of the patriarchs; he is the last of the patriarchs. he was the church that was in the... he was the--the spirit that was in the church of ephesus; he is the spirit of the church in laodicea. he is the first and the last, a to z: first, last, he that was and shall come, root and offspring of david, the morning star, the lily of the valley, the rose of sharon. oh, there's four hundred and some titles in the bible pertains to him. just think of it, what he was. and yet he was the lowly lord jesus that was born in a manger to the praises of god.anything that's humble, watch it, 'cause that's right. anything that's big is a stuffed shirt, so don't pay no attention to it (see?); it's a lot of wind and not nothing to it. all right.now, "he was to look upon as jasper and sardius stone." let's turn back. i get... we got a little time, haven't we? we got about forty minutes yet. let's notice; let's turn back to ezekiel 1. go back in the bible to the old testament, unto ezekiel, and let's read here where ezekiel saw him too, and compare these scriptures now and see where we're at. ezekiel the 1st chapter, all right, now let's read for a moment. i'm going to read the first five verses, and then we're going to read, i've got marked out here, from the 26th to 28. but let's read the first verses now of the 1st chapter of ezekiel the prophet. all right.and it came to pass in the thirtieth year, and in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month,... i was among the captives--among the captives by the river of chebar,... (is that right, chebar? c-h-e-b-b-r, chebar)... and the heavens were opened, and i saw a vision of god.and ... (now, watch.)... in the fifth day of the month, which is the month that king jehoiachin's captive,the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest, the son of buzi, in the land of... chaldeans by the river of chebar; and the hand of the lord was... upon him.and i looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,...watch this prophet here, five hundred and ninety-five years before the coming of christ; see how his vision compares with john's.... a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud,... a fire unfolding itself, and the brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof was the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. and this was their appearance; they had a likeness of... man.notice the color of the spirit of god which was above the likeness of these four creatures, was amber. amber is yellowish green. now, watch: yellowish green, amber... oh, he's the same yesterday... he revealed hisself to ezekiel in the midst of ezekiel's vision. this light that he saw coming above the four living creatures was yellowish green. when he come to john, he appeared in the emerald which is also yellowish green. he comes now to the revelator in yellowish green. he comes to us in yellowish green, the light. walk in the light; he is the light.let's go to the 26th verse now, so we can read to the 28th. the 26th verse, "and above the..." oh, when you get home, i want you to mark that and read every bit of it. save time...and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of stone, as the appearance of sardine stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness of the appearance of a man above... it. (that was the son of man. see? christ.)now, watch how he was--how he was arrayed here.and i saw as the colors of amber,... (watch, around this son of man.)... as the appearance of a fire around about within it,... about within it, in it, from the appearance of his loins...listen. be spiritual; be understanding, and in your own hearts here, i adjure you in jesus' name, keep this to yourself. but just remember how blessful. "i..." let's start again in the 27th verse. listen, everyone. be real understanding now.and i saw as the colour of amber... (that's yellowish green.)... as the appearance of fire around about... it,... (fire around the amberish green),... now from the appearance of his loins even upward,... (from his loins upward)... and from the appearance of his loins... downward, i saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had the brightness around about. (fire all around)as the appearance of a bow and the color in the days of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness around about. this was the appearance and the likeness and the glory of the lord. and when i saw it, i fell upon my face, and i heard a voice of one that spake.watch. are you ready? listen. keep this now, just remember, to let you know. (gene, you can hold this tape.) listen. (no, i don't have to hold it there; that's all right.) i mean just keep the tape; permit this to the church. notice this. now, that you might know that the color of the light that's with the lord, and the lord's light that follows the lord, and this is the lord, is amber, yellowish green. that's the same color of the light that's with us today, as the scientists has took its picture: yellowish green, amber.when a little boy, and i seen it for my first time, you remember, the old-timers here. i always told you before the actual picture was taken, "it was yellowish green, which is amber." now, to let you know that the spirit of the lord...he said, when he seen it from the loins of the living creature that stood in his presence, "from his loins upward was like fire, a light from his loins downward was covered with light. and all around was many colors like unto a rainbow." is that right?i want you to remember, god still exists in the same colors, "from the loins upward, fire, amber color," shot with a movie camera or with a color camera, "amber from the loins up, from the loins down, and all around, many colors like is in the rainbow in the sky after a rain": jesus christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. the holy spirit's still in his power, still in his church in this last day. there you are. not me, i was just standing there, but it was a picture that was taken. i want you to look at that, just exactly what ezekiel saw: same colors, the same way, and acted the same way, and flushed the same way, of the living creatures. what is it? the living creatures represent the living church, the church that's a living by the power and the resurrection of christ. them same amber colors has covered it from the loins upward, from the loins downward.there's no more guessing; science has took the picture. look at their colors; just look at the colors of fire in there (see?), the rainbow. look at this yellowish-emerald color. now, on this camera, it was just a straight photographer's camera. on this camera was color, colored pictures, kodachrome color. look at the emerald color in there. if i could get it over a light somewhere where you could see it in the back. can you see now? "like unto a rainbow," look at the streaks coming back and forth like the rainbow, every one a different color. we're going to get into that in a few minutes, what are those colors and what do they reflect?oh, that just makes my poor heart jump for joy. and to know that in this day that we're living, that christ... when all other grounds is sinking sands, all other ground... i think, "why can't i tell that? why can't i make the world see it?" the world wasn't meant to see it. the world won't see it; they never will see it. but the church is receiving the mightiest shaking it ever had.in them days they couldn't have took a picture of it. they can now because they got the mechanical devices. the ones who are trying to take the mechanics to deny god, comes right back around and proves there is a god. that's right. emerald... now, you remember, i never made that up; i'm reading it to you right out of the bible. watch as i read, and look, and behold that it is the same lord god; there's no difference. watch the 27th verse.and i saw... the colour of amber, as in the appearance of fire... (see, like blazes licking)see? amber colors coming from a fire, you see it now? amber, this is the amber colors coming from a fire. down here it says.and the appearance like a bow, or a rainbow, in the days after a rain,... rainbow, in the days after a rain,...and there was a--a living creature. what john represented, the entire church was taken up. i told you. one person here in a vision can represent the entire body of christ...?... covered. now, watch.and i saw... the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire... about with it, and the appearance... from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, i saw as it were the appearance of fire,...watch, look at the fire spray. out of what? the rainbow, the seven colors. now, watch, there's exactly seven colors there, and the rainbow has seven colors.i saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had the brightness around about.as the appearance of a bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness around about,... (round about the throne of god. see?)... this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord... (not the lord now, the glory of the lord)...the glory of the lord covering over his church because he is in his church. amen. oh, it sounds foolish to the unwise, but how great it is to those who believe it. see?this was the appearance and likeness of the glory of the lord. and when i saw it, i fell on my face, and i heard a voice speak...now, he goes ahead and tells what the vision meant, which we not have time to get into this morning.now, notice how the lord in his great mercy give us these things.now, let's take another. both ezekiel and john saw him in the mystery of his colors and light, and called it a amber color. john later... you that puts your--putting down the scriptures: i john 1:5 to 7. john later (and was on the isle of patmos about three years when he wrote the book), when he come back, an old man in his nineties, in i john 1:5 and 7, he said, "god is light." john had an experience; he had seen him and he knowed that he was light, light, eternal light; not cosmic light, not lamp light, electric light, sunlight, but eternal light. oh, how i love him. "god is light."notice, we're going to start back now and see where we're at. on the 3rd verse yet, aren't we? are we going to get it? i hope. all right.he was to look upon as jasper and sardius stone: and there was a rainbow... about the throne, in the sight like unto an emerald, yellowish green.now, rainbow, you notice it was a rainbow. let's go back in genesis 9 and find out in genesis 9:13. and we'll find back here the rainbow, when a rainbow first appeared. genesis the 9th chapter, and we will begin at the 13th verse, genesis 9:13. all of you like this? oh, i love it. i just don't like it; i love it. look.i do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token,... (watch.)... token of a covenant betwixt me and the earth... (what? "betwixt me and noah"? no. "betwixt me and the earth.")and it shall come to pass, when i bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:and i will remember my covenant, which--which is betwixt me and you... (now, he come back to his covenant betwixt them, but the rainbow covenant.)...see, the covenant was life for noah, that he spared him, but the covenant that god made with himself was a rainbow, that he would not... now, i'll show you what noah's covenant was with god, in a minute. but this here was god's own covenant with himself (amen.), a rainbow.now, we find out that a covenant then is a token, a token. god said it was a token here, didn't he? see?i set my... i do set my bow in the clouds,... (that's after the destruction of the world, destroyed by water; all flesh besides noah--noah was destroyed.)... and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. (not "me and the world," the world's a cosmos. see? but this is between me and the earth.)now, a covenant, a token of what? a token of what? of a sacrifice that has been accepted. now, get genesis 8:20 and 22. now, genesis 8:20 and 22, all right, right across the page it is.and noah built an altar unto the lord; and took... every clean beast, and... every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.and the lord smelled a sweet savour; and the lord said in his heart, i will not again curse the ground... (curse the ground)... any more for man's sake; for the imagination of his heart is evil from his youth; neither will i again smite any more every thing living, as i have done.and now, read the last verse.and while the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest,... cold and heat,... summer and winter,... day and night shall not cease... (a covenant)same thing that john saw... jesus, god's accepted covenant surrounding the heavens. and around about him was a rainbow around about the throne in the sight like a emerald, amberish, green light around the throne. praise be to god.watch. noah's composed of primarily... noah's rainbow composed primarily of seven colors. anybody knows the rainbow's got seven colors. now, what are the colors? red, orange, violet... no, red--red, orange, green, blue, indigo, and violet. that's the colors of the rainbow. now, we got a deep thing here, and i'm just going to have to hit the high spots of it, 'cause it's getting too late, now, remember, orange--or, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.now, if you notice, seven... watch. seven rainbows... seven colors; i mean, seven-colored rainbow. that meant seven bows. seven bows, seven churches reflecting seven lights, each light wrapped into the other one. it started off with red, red. after red come orange, which is a reflection of red. after orange was... after--after orange come yellow, which is red and orange mixed together, makes yellow. then green. green and blue makes black. then come indigo. and then from indigo comes violet, which is part of blue. oh, oh, oh. hallelujah. don't you see? god, in his seven-colored rainbow, his covenant that he made, a covenant that through seven church ages, the seven colors he would save the earth.what would he do? remember, he made it with the earth, his color. but now, watch. this rainbow only, horizontally, just covers (in a bow) one half the earth. that's all noah's rainbow colored--just covered just half the earth. it was in an arch; that's all you can see. (but when john saw him in his emerald color, he surrounded the whole throne of god.) the half has never yet been told. he colored... he just--the earth, just makes an arch, it's just a half of it; that's the church ages.but when john saw him in this amber color, the amber color, he surrounded and covered around like a halo. a halo... [brother branham taps on something--ed.]... a halo of amber color surrounded his being. see? one color, one god over all, through all, and in all, but there is seven church ages.that great jewel. what was it? it was perfect. it was at the age of thirty-three and a half years old when god put it through the big bumping machine, when he took it over and begin to shape it up. he cut it; he mashed it; he bruised it.... he was wounded for our transgressions,... bruised for our iniquity: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we were healed.what did god do to that perfect man? there's only one of them in the world, only one in the world, and that was him. and god chiseled him off here, "and he was wounded for our transgressions." because i was a sinner, he let the rainbow light of his seven church ages flash upon me, to know that he was wounded for my transgressions.there's your seven-colored rainbow. "he was bruised for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace upon him; with his stripes we're healed." god cut him, and bruised him, and mashed him, and cut him, that he might reflect through his dying wounds, forgiveness of sins, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness. the seven spirits of god are the seven fruits of the spirit that would reflect back in his people. he was bruised, shaped, and formed, that the light of god shining through that one man's body might redeem the whole world; "i be lifted up from the earth, i'll draw all men unto me." watch those rainbow colors as they reflect.but when john saw him here, what was it? the day of redeeming was over. it was all over, so he seen him back in his original condition, an amber color. not only just half the world, it can only... the sun can only shines on half the world at a time (see?), as it goes around. but when john saw him, he was setting to look upon as jasper and sardius stone, amber colors; mix the two together, you got amber. "and a amber color around the throne." oh, my. oh, i--i tell you, that just... we could just go on and on.seven spirits, seven colors, seven church ages, seven ministers, seven lights, everything's in a seven. god's perfect in seven. god worked six days; the seventh day he rested. the world will exist six thousand years, and the seventh thousand is the millennium.notice, in a half circle, half's not yet been known. now, surely these things represent something.so we see him in the circle bow of green, amber color. this greenish, what does green represent? life. green is the evergreen, always stays green, is life. what does it mean? that god has promised, as he took a oath back there in genesis, that he would no--put the rainbow in the sky, that he would no more destroy this world by water. he also takes his oath and swears by himself, that all the seed of abraham he'll raise up, and this world will stand all of its shaking judgments. the judgments we're going through on the future lessons we got coming, will show you where that this world will belch and turn into volcanics, and blow to pieces, and upside down and everything. but he swears by himself that he'll not destroy it, but he'll smooth it off again and put his children on the earth for that millennium. oh, my.now, the first throne was in heaven, judgment seat. the second throne was in christ; the third throne is in man.and now, we notice that the twelve foundations were names of the apostles. and the twelve gates has a name of each tribe on the gate. how we look at that and see those twelve elders, the twelve tribes, the twelve apostles, the twelve foundations, the twelve gates. oh, my. take them numerals of god and you can't miss it nowhere; she'll run right smack straight everywhere every time.that's the reason (you see?), we got these six days that the world has labored in, and we're way up close to this seventh day now. the first two-thousand years god destroyed the water--the world with water. second two-thousand years, christ come. this is 1961, right at the door, just a little time. and look, jesus said, "now, it won't run all the way out," he said, "'cause i'll have to cut the work short. if i don't, the atomic bomb will destroy all flesh. (you see?) for the elect's sake i will cut the work short in righteousness, cut it off part of the time." see, then the thousand-years' millennium, the great day.while the church has labored against sin for six thousand years, and the seventh thousand is the millennium. like god made six thousand years to build the world, and the seventh thousand he rested from all of his works. and the church labors against sin for six thousand years, and the seventh thousand the church rests.the white robes that was on the elders is the righteousness of the saints. the "white" means "righteousness." and because they were robed showed they were "priests or judges" white-robed, priests, judges, prophets, so forth (see?), what they were. they were white-robed, the twenty and four elders. there will be twenty and four elders. there'll be twelve of them for the twelve tribes of israel, the twelve apostles for the church.and they set in the courts of the great king. remember, they're setting out there, these are. and here is the bride and christ setting on his throne, and his wife setting by him, the church. the twenty and four elders... the hundred and forty-four thousand eunuchs of the temple ministering to him. where he gets up, his wife goes with him. oh, oh, my.but one of these mornings, friend, one of these mornings, when that's all over, she'll bloom forth again. the fields with its whitening clover and the--the fragrance off of the rose will blend in with the blossom off of the tree of life, and christ will return some morning. when the big birds, the doves, will set in the trees and coo, and there'll be no more death and no more sorrow. christ and his redeemed will return to the earth, not old people, but young forever, immortal will stand in his likeness, the sun and the stars to outshine.revelation, chapter four #3 jeffersonville in 61-0108 188throne of mercy and judgmentrojc 645-716people today how they are, "great something's going to shake the whole world and everything," that's unscriptural. no, sir. the next thing in order is the going of the church. read in the church ages, you see what...now, these other things that's to take place, is during the time of the wedding ceremony when the church is in glory. god returns back with great wonders to perform, international miracles and things by the jews; don't go to the church at all.ephesians the 5th chapter and the 26th verse.that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the... [congregation says, "word."--ed.] (hm.)what's the reflection of him? then the first thing it would reflect, would be his name. is that right? it would reflect his name. next thing would reflect, would be his power. see what i mean? it'd reflect everything he is.and "therion" is "wild, untamed savages." in other words, if you'll watch the 11th chapter, "the beast of rome," the 13th chapter, "the united states," the 17th chapter, "both united states and rome," of the denominational churches consolidated with catholicism makes them a unconverted, untamed to the gospel (whoo): untamed.here's my interpretation. i hope it's right; i believe it is. they are god's guards of his throne.and they went every one straight forward:...and the first beast was like a lion,... the second beast was like a calf,... the third beast was a face... had... of a man, and the four beasts were like flying eagles... the fourth beast... like a flying eagle.... and the spirit... wherever they went now to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.as for the likeness of the living creatures, and their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like of the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth light... (that's god. from the fire went light, the--not cosmic light now, but eternal light.)and the living creatures ran and turned... (let's see.)... the living creatures ran and returned, and as the appearance of a flash of lightning.now, as i beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.the appearance of the wheels... their work was like unto... colour of... beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was... it was a wheel in the middle of a wheel."what's the symbol here, brother branham? what is it?" it means that these guards--these guards was god's ark... they were in journey, rolling on wheels when ezekiel saw them; but when john saw them, they'd already come into their right position in heaven. the ark of god was on earth, rolling on wheels, as they took it from place to place, meant it was in travel; they took it all the way up through the wilderness and all the way into the temple and so forth; but now it's received up, 'cause the church age is over, and it's received up into glory. see? it's stationary now in heaven with all the angels and things around it. we find them after while taking off their crowns, and falling on their faces, and giving glory to him. see? it was god's guards of the temple--of the ark.full of eyes without, within."and they flew," and so forth, "and had eyes without, within, and behind." it spoke of their intelligence. they knowed what was, which is, and which shall come; for they was right at the seat, so close till they wasn't even human. temple guards--or not temple guards, the temple guards are the hundred and forty-four thousand. but this is the mercy seat guards, the throne guards. the throne right up next to god, "living creatures," next thing to god, standing there. their intelligence, they knowed what was, which is, what shall come. they had "eyes without," showing what they could see, what was to come; "eyes within," knows everything now; and "eyes in the back," which knowed what was. which was, which is, which shall come, reflecting through the church ages "he that was, which is, and shall come; jesus christ the same yesterday, today, and forever."hold them now. we're going to drive--drive that thing plumb through the blackboard in a few minutes. watch it. now, just a minute.reveals their intelligence, and it showed they knowed--know... they knowed all the future and the present and past, and all about it. and their... they were tireless. they never grew tired. they couldn't be anything connected with men; he grows tired. but they were tireless; they sang "holy, holy, holy. holy, holy, holy. holy, holy, holy, lord god almighty. holy, holy, holy." all day and all night through every age, "holy..."holy, holy, holy, is the lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of... glory.and the lord... said, behold, the man is become... one of us,...now, my loving and precious and darling sisters (let me place it like that.), do not think that i am throwing a reflect upon the--the loyalty and the gracious, precious jewel of womanhood. i'm trying to show here what a woman... please. and to you on tape, you women that'll be listening to this tape. i am not trying to scorn you; i'm only a servant of the lord to bring light. the lowest, and immoralest, and most filthy thing on earth is a woman when she's bad. and the most precious jewel that there is to a man, besides his salvation, is a good woman. and i'm speaking to that low, immoral, degraded... and i'm going to show you right here while we're at it, just might as well show you why that i... that the bible teaches for women not to be preachers, pastors, teachers, or anything else in church. now, just listen to this.and the lord... said, behold, the man is become... one of us,... (now, he never said the woman has become one, the man has become one...)... and knows good and evil:... (the woman didn't; she was deceived. do you see it?)now, paul said, "i suffer not a woman to teach or to usurp any authority, but--for adam was first formed and then eve. and adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived." so she didn't become one of god. she didn't know no difference; she was deceived. you get it? if you do, say "amen," so i... [congregation says, amen."--ed.]... the lord... said, behold, the man is become... one of us, to know good and evil: and know... and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:therefore the lord... sent him forth from the garden of eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.so he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims, and a flying sword--flaming sword which turned every way,... (see the four beasts? there's only four ways you can go, see?: east, north, west, and south. these cherubims had a flaming sword at the gate of the garden)... to keep the way of the tree of life. ('cause if man ever got ahold of the tree of life, then he could live forever.)and these cherubims, first mentioned, was placed at the east gate of the garden, going four ways. i should've made that a little different from that; i can't do justly to god's orders and things like that, but i--i just... so that you'll know what i mean. there's the garden of eden. and this is the gate right here, opens up here, swings out, and at this gate there was cherubims--cherubims. and remember, it doesn't say "a cherubim," it said, "cherubims." cherubims was placed there to guard what? the tree of life. that's what they was to guard, the way of the tree of life. the way, who is the way? jesus. where's it reflected from? here is the holy place; here are the cherubims.now, watch, put all this down. here is the holy of holy, this holies of holies, holy of holies; this is the holy place; and here is the sea; and here is the light, candles, the seven that's reflects the light from here, in here, in here, in here, in here, in here, in here. see? what do they reflect? they are guarding and reflecting with the fire of god the way to the tree of life. see, it can't come from over here, presbyterian seminary or a pentecostal seminary; it's got to come from here, reflecting the light. all right.you notice, these--these cherubims that john saw here must've been interested in keeping the tree of life, so they must be interested in human beings. or read genesis, getting back to genesis again; they kept the tree of life, guarded it, the way of life, the way of life. how is the way? jesus said, "i am that way. i am that bread that come from god out of heaven. if a man eats this bread, he'll live forever." now, there is a way back to that tree of life. you get it?now, at this, i want to show now and make this sure, it's an altar. now, this must've been an altar at the garden of eden. i tell you why. do you remember both cain and abel come up here to worship? so that showed that god's altar was moved and set here at the garden of eden, and the only way back to eden is by the altar. here you are again (see?), back to eden through the altar. and they were to keep that way there, guard it, that they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood.(o god, can't people see it?) see, nothing but the blood. there has to be an atonement, a mercy seat there; this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat; and when this altar, if the blood is lifted, there'll stand on that judgment day the fire of god's wrath to guard that tree again. only one thing will enter into this gate to eden again, will be through the blood of jesus christ. you see it?guarding this gate... cain and abel come up here to worship. so it must've been an altar that they guard (is that right?), these cherubims."make everything on earth as patterned after heaven." is that right? all right.the person that's approaching into this holiest of holies has to be anointed with the same holy spirit. and as he walks, "holy, holy, holy, unto..." (not with a cigar in his mouth) "holy," (not with his collar turned around) "holy, holy, holy," dressed in the holiness of jesus christ. hm. how wonderful thou art. oh.now, "the mercy seat..." now, the mercy seat's in the heart, seat where the shining forth of his--his glory in all of his children, the shekinah glory in the human heart. here's the human heart. is that right? is that the mercy seat? how do you come through it into that, through these different systems? through self-will, self-will, comes into here, and through there comes out what? shekinah glory. what--what is the shekinah glory? it's god's presence. and when a man's walking, or a woman, he's reflecting the shekinah glory. he don't go into gambling dens, and--and carry on, and go out here and deny the word. no matter what the people says, he's got his heart set on one thing: god. and if he's truly called of god, then jesus christ reflects himself through him with the shekinah glory, doing the same things he did back there, manifesting the same gospel, preaching the same word, same word being made manifest in the same measure it was then; just like it was truly at pentecost it's measured back again. oh, my."mercy seat..." ezekiel and john both seen the same things. now, notice. now, we're just about to come to the end, just in a little bit. now, here's where i want you to get something. oh, please don't miss it. now, how many knows that those cherubims was living creatures and not beasts? they were the--a high order.now, is an angel a higher order than a man or a lower order? all right, sir. which is the greatest, a son of god or an angel? son of god. which would god hear the best, an angel standing there before him pleading for something, or one of you all pleading? one of you all. see? 'cause you're sons and daughters. they're--they're servants. see? they're servants, and you're sons and daughters. so see what authority you have, just afraid to use it.now, i want you to notice here; this is beautiful. oh, my. let me get over here and skip some of this so i can get down to this. get your pencils out; here's what i really wanted you to draw in. [brother branham draws on the blackboard--ed.] maybe i better make that a little smaller.now, israel in their journey, when they camped... now, watch this close. they camped: one, two, three, four. (no, made it wrong.) one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three; that's the way they camped around the mercy seat. now, and all of you know that; you've watched the--read in the old testament.now, on the east side, the east side, right here, i'll put it down so you'll be sure to get it. east, the east side was always judah. this is the gate, j-u-d-a, judah. and with judah was the head of three tribes with their banner: three tribes with their banner, the banner of judah. you remember... how many seen the "ten commandments," cecil demille's "ten commandments"? all right. see, you read it right here in the scripture, in the scripture there, rather; there was judah on the east side. all right.on the west side, down here (now, you put it down; you can read it right if you want, exodus, and so forth, as they come out.) was ephraim, e-p-h. and he had three tribes with their banner. all right, ephraim...now, and on the south side was reuben, r-u-b, with three tribes and their banners.and on the north side was dan: dan with three tribes, and three tribes and their banner. all right.now, that's the way they camped. now, remember. let's read now in the scripture now so we get this just exactly right. i'll begin back at the 7th verse.and the... beast was liken unto a lion, and the second... liken unto a calf... (or a young ox),... and the third beast was like the face of a man, and the four beast was--and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.and the four beasts each had of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, holy, holy,... lord god almighty, which was, which is, and shall come. and when these beasts gave glory and honour and thanks to him that set on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever.the four and twenty elders fell down before him that set on the throne, and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns--cast their crowns before the throne, saying,thou art worthy, o lord, to receive glory... honour... power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are... created.now, now, you watch. on the east side, east side, he saw what kind of a face? did you notice? it was a lion, l-i-o-n; that was the banner. that was the--that was the standard banner of juda. because he is... jesus come out of the... true. and he is the lion of the tribe of juda.now, how many ever seen the zodiac? many of you know what it is: the stars. see? that was god's first bible. now, what does it start off at, the first number in the zodiac, the first figure? is the virgin. is that right? and what's the last one? leo the lion. the first coming and the second coming of christ. all through there they get the crossed cancer--or the crossed age is just where it's crossed fishes, which is the cancer age, and we live right through it.and notice in the pyramid when he built it in time of enoch, every stone was in there. they could measure them things just exactly and tell the wars and things. everything is complete but the headstone. why? you notice on your dollar bill? take it out and look; the cap's off of it. why? it never was capped. christ is the headstone that was rejected; he was the rejected, the headstone. he's coming back pretty soon. watch how that church, way back there in the lutheran age, way wide at the bottom; then become minority, little bit more minority, little bit more until it comes right down; after it leaves the pentecostal age, then comes right down to every stone to fit right in to put that cap in there, a church that'll bring jesus the same yesterday, today, and forever. just as perfect as it can be.now, he was the lion of the tribe of juda.now, anybody that's ever read the bible know what dan's number was over there--what dan... oh, i mean what, yeah, what dan was. his... he was an eagle. that's right. he was a eagle. somebody's been reading the bible. he was a eagle.now, the reuben was the man. he was the first one, the weakest one of the bunch. didn't jacob say so in--in genesis 49? "reuben, thou art the first of my strength; but like water, you went up on my couch and defiled my couch," and lived with his father's concubine. see? that's the immorals of the human being. see? the animal don't have them immorals, the lion, none of these things has that; but the man does, run with the next man's wife and so forth. just like... just the same thing, everything's completed.now, this down here, this, dan was an eagle. and, this, reuben was the man's face. and ephraim is the ox. now, you get the picture there? ephraim... there's the way they camped, in the bible.now, if you'll notice, dan is the head of three tribes; judah is the head of three tribes; reuben is the head of three tribes, and ephraim is the head of three tribes. three four's is twelve, the twelve tribes of israel. see each one with their banner; and the banner of judah was a lion; the banner of reuben, man; the banner of ephraim, an ox; the banner of--of--of dan was an eagle.now, look back here what john said, "and one had the face..." let's read here now, just see if it isn't the same thing was like in heaven:... the first beast was like a lion,... (judah)... the second beast was like a calf,... (that's a young ox.)... the third beast was the face of a man, and the fourth beast was... a flying eagle.just exactly the tribes of israel camped around, guarding, this earthly guards of the right to the ark. hallelujah. don't you see it?here. mercy, m-e-r-c-y s-e-a-t, "mercy seat," nothing could come anywhere around it without crossing those tribes. crossing what? the lion; crossing the man, intelligence of the man; and crossing the workhorse, as an ox; by crossing the eagle, the swiftness of it. see? the heaven, the earth, in between, and all around... you see, they were guards. and above it was the pillar of fire. brother, nothing touched that mercy seat without the approach...and the only thing that could approach it was through the blood. aaron went in there once a year with the blood. now, you see it?now, watch. each head of three tribes guarding the mercy seat, the mercy seat of the old testament... now, have you got that down, everybody? now, here's a brand new one, brother. listen to this, then we'll go. now, remember, that was the guards of the old testament. how many's ever read it in the bible, you know that that's right? see, that's the guards of the old testament.now, we're living in another age. glory. oh, i love this age. don't you? now, god has a mercy seat today to be guarded. you believe that? where's the mercy seat found? in the heart of man. where did it come in the heart of man? at the day of pentecost when the holy ghost (which is god) come into human hearts. is that right? now, let's mark this down here, and get ready to draw it if you want to. pentecost, p-e-n-t; i'll put: pentecost. this is the mercy seat, the holy ghost. put in here... i'll tell you what, make it more appropriate, let's put in here the "dove" which means the bird. see? all right, guarding the mercy seat, now has god got guards for the mercy seat today? now that... now, watch how beautiful it's drawed out.now, pentecost, after pentecost, wrote a book of what? acts of the holy ghost, a-c-t-s. is that right? what does the acts start off with, the first thing to enter into salvation? acts 2:38. who's that last one...?... is that right? they was all filled with the holy ghost and begin to speak with other tongues. and peter stood up and preached them a sermon. they said, "what can we do? how we going to get into that?" he said, acts 2:38, "repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ."now, remember, god's got some guards for that--for that mercy seat. what is that mercy seat guard? all right. m-a-t-h, matthew, on the east; luke--luke, mark, and john. all of their four gospels vindicate the book of acts to come; they guard it anywhere you want to look at it.now, notice this. matthew, mark, luke, and john, what is it? earthly number of the gospels, four. all right, notice.how is the gate? the gate is what? jesus. jesus said, "strait is the gate." is that right? is it spell... how is it spelled, s-t-r-a-i-t or s-t-r-a-i-g-h-t? "s-t-r-a-i-t" means "water," "water is the gate." how do you come in? "repent, every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ," unlocks the gates. whew.does he guard it? "father, son, and holy ghost," father, son, and holy ghost, just this: titles to that one name.see if they're guarding divine healing around the throne of god. mark 16, mark 11:21 and 22.did you think that--that god don't put a guard around his word? here's that ox, lion, man, eagle. isn't it still setting at those gates right here on earth right now? they're the gospels, the four gospels. see? and you notice, every way they went they went straight forward. they don't contradict one another; they stay with one another. see? one goes with the shrewdness of a man; the other one goes with the swiftness of an eagle; the other one's a pastor... one's evangelist, to fly like evangelist. see? the other one's a pastor; the other's sturdy; the other one's shrewd. see, guarded on every side, god guarding this holy ghost gospel. believe it, brother. all right.matthew, mark, luke, and john, them four guards come and was writing everything they seen coming to pass, telling it just like it is, how it was going to happen, what was going to take place. then all at once they framed it around, and here it come. amen. matthew, mark, luke, and john is the framework, or the guard work that protects the main temple, the throne, the pentecostal blessing.not pentecostal denomination, brother, sister; they're plumb back outside of the whole thing, farther back than any other churches. they're farther away than lutherans was; lutheran did keep a little better than they did (that's right.), more like it. just exactly right, gene, 'cause, now, didn't see jesus on the outside of the lutheran church trying to get in, but was trying... 'cause i think he never was in the first place...?... he--he was in the pentecostal church and was put out. that's right.now, let's go down to the next gospel, mark, 16th chapter, see if mark guarded this pentecostal blessing. mark, the 16th chapter,they didn't believe the ones that was trying to tell them the message. see, that's the way it is today. the people that's got a witness of the holy ghost; the people said, "nonsense, a bunch of holy-rollers." and he upbraided them for the hardness of their heart (see?) and their unbelief, that had knowed him in his resurrection.and he said unto them, go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.what? to preach the--this. there's only one gospel; four guards. "preach this gospel to every creature." now, remember, he's taking in both, all four guards matthew, mark, luke, and john (see?), "preach the gospel to every creature."he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; and he that believeth not shall be damned. (see, you have to enter this baptism here.)he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;... he that believeth not shall be damned. (oh, brother, believe, please.)and... (conjunction, to tie the rest of the sentences together)... and these signs shall follow them that believe;...well, now, let's see, what does the methodist say? "if you can shout, live a good life."the baptists says, "just have faith and be baptized."episcopalian says, "stand like a episcopalian, like that, and bow when the chanting's being done."and the catholic says, "say a hail mary."the pentecostal says, "join our denomination. be baptized in the name of father, son, and holy ghost." there you go. see?... these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name... (no father, son, holy ghost about that)... in my name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;they shall take up serpents;... if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shalt lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover. (amen. oh, brother.)now, get right back to the 11th, and then we're just about ready to close. matthew 11, and i got 20 and 21, jesus speaking. all these are jesus speaking now, not a one of them but what jesus is speaking, every one.and on the morrow, when they... came near bethany, he was hungry:and seeing a fig tree...that's when he cursed the tree, that's matthew 21. i got... :12, pardon me. mark 11: 21 and 22.and peter calling to remembrance said unto him, master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst in the way...and jesus answered and said unto him, have faith in god. (see?)for verily i say unto you... (them that's on the inside)... say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but... believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he can have--he shall have whatsoever he saith.boy, the south gate's guarded by the ox. the north gate's guarded by the lion, the north gate... i mean the east gate. and the north gate is guarded by the flying eagle, john, the evangelist. then the physician on this side, luke, the man.now, let's see what luke says. take luke the 1st chap... i believe we got luke 10 and 1 to 12. actually, it's the commission. you all know what it is, but... luke the 10th chapter, and 1 to 12. all right, we could go right ahead and read it all, but we won't have time to do that.go your ways...i'll start at the 3rd verse:go your ways: behold, i send you forth as lambs among wolves.carry neither purse, nor scrip,... (see? don't go in some name of the denomination; you go as i send you. see? don't go with the assurance that you're going to get a hundred thousand dollars for this revival; if you don't, don't go. you see? set up your campaigns, and he said, "go where i'm sending you." see?) carry neither purse, nor script, nor shoes:...salute no man by the way... (don't stop by and say, "i'll go over and see how they're--these are going along, how these..." go right on where i send you. pay no attention to nobody else.)and to whatsoever house you enter,... say, peace be unto this house.... if the son of peace be there, your peace shall return... shall rest upon it: if not, it shall return unto you again.and in the same hour remain--in the same house... (rather)... remain, eating and drinking such things as they give:... (now, all this stuff about not eating meat, and so forth, my, goodness. see?)... for a labourer is worthy of his hire. go not from house to house... (go with the joneses today, to dinner, and go with the--the next pair the next day, and the next pair next. you stay right there.)that's when i go into a meeting, you know, why i stay right in the hotel, and stay right there, that's exactly where i find peace. see? don't go from house to house.and to whatsoever city ye shall enter there, when they receive you, eat such things that's set before you:and heal the sick, heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them. the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you.but now, let me read the next verse.but into whatsoever city you enter, and they receive you not, go your way out of the city in the same day,... even the very dust of the city, which cleaves on--on us, we... (let's see now.)... even the... and even the very dust of your city, which cleaves on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you.but i say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in the day of judgment for sodom, than for that city.oh, brother, with that blessed assurance. if they don't see, receive you, go ahead, just say, "well, if you don't want me, i'll just wipe the dust off--and off my shoes, and go right on out." in other words, say, "i never took nothing; if i eat anything, i'll pay you for it," and just go on. he said, "verily..." and every one of those cities that they went to and was not received, every one of them is sunk and gone today. and every city--city that received them, is standing till this day. there you are.it's not a man today; it's the holy ghost working through a man, or men (see?), that does the work. it's not the man; the man's just a vessel (see?), but the holy ghost is the oil that's in that vessel. see?revelation, chapter five #1 jeffersonville in 61-0611 80bruised serpentrevelation chapter four, who is william branham?rojc 717-746oh, hallelujah. i hope you christians see it. we are the salt of the earth. god gave this to his sons. he gave us the jurisdiction over all nature, all animals, all life everywhere. but adam, our father, forfeited it to satan. but where does it fall back to? the rightful owner, god who made it. amen.revelation, chapter five #2 jeffersonville in 61-0618 121rojc 747-793what did we have at the beginning? eternal life. we was heirs of the world. we had life; we never had to die. we never had to be sick. we never had to get old. we never had any worry. there was no funerals, no graves, no evil, no death, no gray hairs, no stooped shoulders, no mourning, no crying. we had life eternal. we had the jurisdiction over all the earth. we was just a god (that's all.) on the earth: walked about, and if this tree didn't look right standing here, we'd say, "be thou plucked up and set over here," and it would do it. the winds was blowing and we didn't want the winds to blow, "peace, be still," and it did it. and what did he come to do? to redeem all that back to us again (oh, oh, oh, my.), get all that back again.and now nature in itself is groaning, waiting for the what? manifestations of the sons of god, for the sons of god to be manifested.and we have the earnest of our salvation now, and can take our brother that's dying with cancer, and stand by that little breath of redemption, and pray the prayer of faith over him that'll turn a shadow of a man back to a healthy man again; what will we do when our full possession comes? amen.nature knows that. nature's groaning and we're groaning with it. nature is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god, because nature was cursed with its master. when its master was cursed (the highest), then nature fell with the master. but when this kinsman redeemer come (hallelujah) and redeemed back the man that's the master over nature, then all nature is waiting for the main master.what do we do? take the axe and slip it in our hands and chop the tree down if we want to; but that day we won't do that. amen.all nature is waiting for its master. and the master is the sons of god that was given this earth. now, god will have his heavens, of course, but this was given to men. and the kinsman redeemer come to redeem us back to that we lost. how beautiful. my, i just think that's... "a lamb redeemer..."when the work is finished, we have all things again. what kind of all things? we have all power. we have eternal life. we have eternal health. we have eternal youth. we have eternal power. oh, we're just eternal with the eternal. and, then, we're all waiting for that time to come, waiting and groaning, waiting.and this sevenfold book of seven redemption plans has been brought to us, and that's what this book holds. now, we're going to get over in the 10th chapter where this mighty angel proclaims something, and he had a little book that john had to eat. and when he did, he got it into his belly and it was bitter, but in his lips it was sweet.when you have digest it, then it gets bitter, everybody's against you, everybody telling "you're a holy-roller, you're this, that, or the other. see, you're--you're--you're off your head." so it's hard to digest it; but when you're testifying of his glory, it's sweet in your lips. that's all. see? and when you stand up in a meeting, you say, "glory to god. halle..." oh, when you're going through that great siege, it's hard; but then when you're out of that great siege you can testify of it, then it's sweet in the lips. see? that's right. that's this book of redemption.now, watch. ruth, deciding, perfectly...oh, if anybody'd say that bible wasn't inspired, there's something wrong with them. every word of it's inspired, every word of it fits right together just like a dovetail on a--on a--on a plank. it just goes perfectly together like the cogs on a mighty wheel turning, just timed to the millionths of a second, just exactly right.so the sabbath is the holy spirit.and when jesus came, who did he come to redeem? israel. what did he do in taking israel? he got the gentile bride. sure, he did, when he took israel. he went... and he went to his own; he had to. what was the first thing he had to do? redeem his own. and the gentile church is just a sister to that woman, the israelite church. certainly. so he had to redeem israel in order to get this. and he had to redeem naomi in order to get ruth, his bride.when the first seal was opened up, the first trumpet sounded and the first plague fell. when the sixth seal opened up, the sixth sounded and the sixth plague fell. just watch it; it's the most beautiful thing that you ever seen. and when i do, i'm going to get me a big, great big blackboard, bring it up here and just teach it right across here, so we just take plenty of time on each seal, and go back and take up the history and things, and prove just when it happened, and show right here in the bible when it said it would take place, and right exactly when it happened, just the date and everything else. i got it. amen...?... that's right. there's the seals.and christ came and preached and prophesied just exactly three and a half years, and the daily sacrifice was taken away, everything just as perfect as it could be. and the moslem of omar was built on the same grounds and stands there to this day. and they will tread down the walls of jerusalem until the gentile dispensation would be finished, the church is taken up (the elect, the bride) out of there.and the two prophets, elijah and a moses, turns to israel for them other two and a--two and a half--or three and a half years. it's the most beautiful thing when you see it brought out...the seventieth week of daniel jeffersonville in 61-0806 143seventy weeks of danielda 89-141and one week left, one week's yet determined.now, when's god going to start their last week?and in the middle of this week... now, here's the seventy... now, if these exactly was seven years, each one of the weeks, and we've already had sixty-nine weeks, then we have the gentile age, and we know we're at the end of the gentile age, then there's one more week left for the jew. is that right? and that's exactly seven years.the spirit of elijah off of this gentile church will just continue right on into that jewish church, go right on in and call moses with him. hallelujah. you see it? and he'll preach the same message of pentecost to those jews, that they rejected the messiah. amen. you see it? it'll be the same pentecostal message that these jews will preach right over to them. and they'll hate those jews so bad till they'll kill them. and they were hated by all nations, and in the midst of the week... because that they'd raised up a great powerful 144,000... they had the holy ghost, and brother, you talk about doing miracles; they did them. they stopped the heavens, and it didn't rain in the days of their prophecy, smote the earth with plagues as oft they wanted to. they give plagues and everything else. they'll give them romans a hard way to go. but finally they'll be killed. our god is a terrible god when he's angry. but remember, that's over in the seventieth week, and the church in glory. amen. the wedding supper's going on. yes.now, notice. that's where we seen her coming back to the millennial temple over here at the end of the jewish age--the anointed. here he come riding on a white horse; those followed him on white horses (horse, powers), dressed in white, blood--or vesture dipped in blood, wrote on him, "the word of god." he cometh, the mighty conqueror (yes, sir.) to set up the millennium--coming to the temple. glory. there he meets that 144,000.now, after that seventieth week here--the seventieth week... this goes on during this seventieth week. and the three in the middle of it, he breaks it, because he kills those two pentecostal prophets (yes, sir.) that smites the earth.now, counting the time, we find that we have exactly (listen.) seventeen years left, and we will have the same span of time given to us as god dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since a.d. 33 until 1977, the same span of time of 1954 years. god deals with us the same as he did with the jews. see? how about that?now, mark down in your book a little scripture here i want to give you. leviticus 25, begin with the 8th verse. god calls a jubilee every forty-ninth year; the fiftieth year was the jubilee. we know that. we understand that. from the first jubilee of leviticus 25:8, in 1977 will be the seventieth jubilee, making exactly 3,430 years. jubilee means the going up, the release.oh, we're watching for the comingof that glad millennium day,when our blessed lord shall comeand catch his waiting bride away.oh, the world is groaning, cryingfor that day of sweet release,when our saviour shall come back to earth again.did you get that? god has dealt with us exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with the jews from the time he give abraham the promise until the rejecting of the messiah in a.d. 33, was 1954 years. and now, we have seventeen years left. we had about 1930 something years. we got seventeen years left until '77 will be the seventieth jubilee since the beginning of jubilees. and what will it be? oh, brother. watch close now. don't miss it. it'll be the jubilee of the going up of the gentile bride and the return of christ to the jews, when they go out of bondage. amen. don't you see? from all the world they've gather there for that day. oh, my. see where we're at? we don't know what time it might happen. we're at the end time.god knows my heart, i never knowed it until yesterday, that 1977 is the jubilee, and exactly the same amount of time run out that he give with israel and everything at the end. so we're at... and here we are at the end of the age, at the coming in of the seventieth week. we don't know what time that the church will be gone. oh, my. what can we do, friends? where are we at?do you see where we are now? do you understand daniel's seventieth week now? see now, when we go on into these seals and things, breaking these seals, the first one comes forth a white horse rider, he's got a bow in his hand. watch who that guy is. watch that pale horse ride after him. see? watch who it is, and look how he come in. watch those 144,000 come in. watch that sleeping virgin when she comes up. then watch all these things take place, the pouring out of the vials, the woes, the three unclean spirits like frogs; watch those things how they fit right in those plagues and exactly when they're poured out. every time a seal opened, a plague pours out and a destruction comes. and watch what takes place right now at the end.and, oh, watch these three prophets--or these two prophets, when they raise up here. and in the middle of the week they're cut off like that, and then starts the battle of armageddon; then god begin to speak himself. then he stands and begins to fight. that prophets are striking the earth. they're preaching the name of jesus christ. they're baptizing the same way. they're doing the same thing that the first pentecostals fathers did, and many are following them. but that who's confederated, that organization moved right on down, and even the power of those prophets didn't break it. and finally they said, "we'll make it all one organization," and he brings in (what is it?) the abomination, romanism, to over-spread the whole thing that makes desolation. the abomination that maketh desolation takes in everything, the filthiness.god hiding himself in simplicity, then revealing himself in the same jeffersonville 63-0317m 183jeffersonville inand i believe that the seven angels who's holds these seven thunders will grant it.god is so simple until the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles;i've never think that it was god's will to test a minister by psychiatry but to test him by the word.faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things that not seen. and faith takes its final resting place on the word of god.and to noah, no matter how much they said the old man was off at his mind, that he was scientifically wrong, and--and mentally he was wrong; but to noah it was the word of the lord.simplicity is greatness."he that humbles himself shall be exalted,he took a common ordinary family (see?): simplicity.and he had him trained in worldly wisdom so that he could fail and show that it isn't wisdom that we'll ever be delivered by; it's by faith that we are delivered.when he couldn't do it by a military training, by an education, by a scientific education, and by a military force, he could not do it, and he give him an old crooked stick off the desert, and he did it with it: god in humility, simplicity. god was in the stick and in moses. and as long as moses had the stick, then god had it, because god was in moses. sure.notice. "not by power, nor by--by might, but by my spirit...he come according to the word, but contrary to their interpretation.god hides himself in a simple little wash woman or an ordinary man with his dinner under his arm, kiss his wife and children good-bye, and go out there, and maybe hide himself in that man to do something that a archbishop would know nothing about. see? you don't hear him blow no horns and send it out.how can i be complete? because the blood, not me, but that blood stands between god and me. i accepted it, and he put it... i'm a sinner, but he's god. but the chemistry stands between me to kill sin, so god sees me just as white as the--the water that's in the--that's in the bleach. sin is gone. it can't even reach him because there's a sacrifice laying there.when this comes to pass, it'll be great, big like this, and it'll be so humble you'll miss the whole thing and just go right on.god lives in simplicity to manifest hisself in greatness. what makes him great? because he can simplify himself. a big great man can't simplify himself; he's got to be a dignitary. see? but he ain't big enough yet. when he comes big enough, then he comes down like this (you see?), can humble himself.the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals jeffersonville in 63-0317e 157i would like to strike again at the seven last trumpets (see?), and it all bridges together. and--and then there is the seven last plagues, and--and it all blends right together as we'll see as we go along.we will pause there for a few moments from the reading of revelations 5 down to the--including the 7th verse.this seven-sealed book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of revelations 10. if you're marking it down... let's... i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow... upon his head,...if you notice that's christ (see?), 'cause he in the old testament was called the angel of the covenant, and he's directly coming to the jews now, for the church is finished. see? all right.... and his face... as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:you remember that angel in revelations 1? same thing. angel is a messenger, and he's a messenger to israel. see? the church has been raptured. see? now, or fixing to be raptured. he comes for his church.now, watch.and he had in his hand a little book open:...now, here it was closed here, and sealed, and here it's open; it's been opened. since that time of the sealing we're getting into tonight, now the book's opened. a little book in his hand--in his... it was opened. oh, how...now, see, the mystery of this seven-sealed book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh church angel's message. see? the seventh angel begins to sound, and there's the messages wrote out there, and we got it in tape and book form.and when the seals are broke and the mystery is revealed, down comes the angel, the messenger, christ, setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head. now remember, this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming.now, here's the angel on earth, and another angel, mighty messenger come down. see, this angel was a earthly angel, messenger. but here comes one down from heaven: a rainbow, covenant. see? only christ, it could be; just exactly like it was in revelations 1st chapter, standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with a rainbow to look upon as jasper and sardius stone.if the prophet rises and tells you that this is just that, and god don't vindicate the thing, forget it. see? but god in every statement, in everything has to vindicate it to make it right. see, see? so his children will watch those things (see?), and be alert.the mysteries should be finished at that time. and this seven-sealed book, remember, it was closed here in revelations the 5th chapter, and in revelations the 10th chapter it is opened.no matter if he falls asleep in the first watch, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh, wherever he falls asleep... what will happen? the trumpet of god shall sound, that last trump will blast forth the same time that the last angel's giving his message and the last seal is opened, that last trumpet will sound, and the redeemer comes forth to take his redeemed possessions: his church, blood-washed.in the seventh watch there went out a--a command or call, "behold the bridegroom cometh."there's a whole difference between the church and the bride.the first seal jeffersonville in 63-0318 169now, i want you to bear in mind, there is a church and a bride. see? you always have to make it run in threes. fours is wrong: threes: threes, sevens, tens, twelves, twenty-fours, and forties, and fifties, in those unbroken numbers. the bible is... and god runs his messages in--in num--in num--numerals of the bible in those numbers. and you get something that flies off of one of those numbers, you'd better watch. it won't come out right on the next things. you got to bring it back here to where you start from.and at the end of the pentecostal age we are supposed to receive, according to the word, as god help me tonight to show you through here, that we are to see--receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church.and then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all. that's right. and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith;now, when we get on the trumpets, we'll go back there and pick up each one of them wars and show you that they followed them churches, show you they follow these seals. wars and rumors of wars... but trumpet denotes political disturbance, whereas seals deals with a religious disturbance. see?a seal is opened; a message is dropped. and then the church is always so set up in its own political ways, and whatevermore, and all of its dignitary; and when that real message drops down, that messenger goes forth, and he shakes them to pieces. that's right. it's religious disturbance when a seal's opened. that's what's happened.and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals... (what happened?)... and i heard, as it was the noise of a thunder...but when these seven thunders over in revelations 10 uttered, he said, "don't write them at all." they're mysteries. we don't know what they are yet; but my opinion they'll be revealed right away. and when it do, it'll give faith for that rapturing grace for that church to move out.where the three and a half years or daniel's seventy weeks (the last half of daniel's seventy weeks which is three and one-half years.)... now, we... how many remembers that from the church ages? sure, you see? there's seventy weeks determined: look how perfect it was; said, "messiah will come, and he'll be cut off for a sacrifice in the midst of the week, and the obligation will cease."then there is still three and a half years waited for the messiahic doctrine to the jew, and god does not deal with the jew and the gentile at the same time. he deals with israel as a nation, gentile as an individual. he never taken the gentiles for his bride, he taken a people out of the gentile. see? now, he deals with israel as a nation. and now, there she sets right there now as a nation.during this tribulation period, after the bride has been called out, and the church goes through the tribulation period, the hundred and forty-four thousand is called by the two witnesses of revelations 11. now, look, they'll prophesy one thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth.seven thunders of revelation... may he show the bride how to prepare for the great translation faith.the thunder was the voice of god when the seal opened.and jesus, his name on earth was redeemer, jesus. when he was on earth, he was the redeemer; that's true. but when he conquered death and hell, and overcome them, and ascended on high, he received a new name. that's the reason they holler the way they do and don't get nothing; it'll be revealed in the thunders. see?notice, the mystery. he's coming, riding... there's got to be something to change this church, you know that. there's got to be something. notice. no man knowed but himself. now, notice, no man knowed but hisself.and his name was called the word of god.and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:... (now, watch.)... and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the obligations to cease,... for the over spreading of abomination he shall make it desolate, even unto the consummation, and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate.christ has prophesied for the three and a half years, and three and a half years are yet determined. is that right? and this prince in that time is to make a covenant with daniel's people, which is the jews. that's when the bride's taken out now. she won't see it.notice. in the last one-half of daniel's week, the people makes a covenant--this prince makes a covenant with rome;now, when he gets the money all under control, then he will break this covenant with the jews,and during that time, them two prophets will rise on the scene and call that hundred and forty-four thousand.thank god, the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory.... when that angel flies at the same time that message drops here for the last trumpet, last angel's message, last seal opens. all happens at the same time. yes, sir. all seals up and goes over into eternity.the second seal jeffersonville in 63-0319 138don't you know how we patterned it out in the church ages, the--them beasts setting there watching that ark there: matthew, mark, luke, and john standing there watching that. and in there is what happened as a results of the writing of matthew, mark, luke, and john. that's what the tree putteth forth its first branch, and that is what happened. and if that tree ever puts forth another branch, they'll write another book of acts behind it. 'cause you see, the same life's got to be in the same thing.so now, today when we look over our denominational churches: methodists, baptists, presbyterians, lutherans, church of christ (so-called), and pentecostals and things, where do we find that? you don't find it. i will admit that the pentecostals has the closest thing to it there is, because they are up here in the laodicean church age. they had truth and rejected it. they got lukewarm with it, and god spued them from his mouth. that's exactly according to the scriptures. you can't make them scriptures lie. see? they're going to be truthful always. don't try to... the only thing, don't try to line your thought up to the--or the scriptures up to your thought, but reline yourself up with the scriptures. that's... then you're running with god. no matter how much you have to cut away or lay aside, line up with that. see?look what it did the first time it fell. well, if god acted like that the first time, he's got to act like that the second time. he's got to act like that every time, or he acted wrong the first time. see, we as mortals, we can make mistakes. god can't. god's first decision is perfect. and the way he chose to do things, there can't be no other better way. he can't improve on it, because it's perfect to begin with. if it isn't, then he isn't infinite.and if he's infinite, then he is omniscient. and if he is omniscient, then he's omnipotent. amen. he's got to be that to be god. see? so he... you can't say, "he learned more." he didn't learn more; he's the--he's the very fountain of all wisdom. see? our wisdom here come from satan. we inherited it from eden where we swapped off faith for wisdom. eve did it.that was down to the persecution of saint patrick's people. and then they call saint patrick their--their saint. saint patrick was about as much catholic as i am; and you know how much i am. he--he detested the doctrine of the church. he refused to go to the pope. yes, sir.saint patrick even... why, you ought--did you ever go up in northern ireland where he had his schools? you know his name wasn't patrick. how many knows that? his name was sucat. that's right. lost his little sister. you remember when they were... see?all right. now, notice: 17th chapter of revelation. now, everybody just try to open your heart and let the holy spirit teach you now.... there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the--had the seven vials,...now, you see there's seven vials; you know these sevens as we are going through. they all happen right at the same time, following the plagues, following the church ages just the same, 'cause it is all sealed up into that one book, everything, and everything happens just in rotation, and one goes right into the other, and the other into the other. there's two spirits a working: god and the devil.the third seal jeffersonville in 63-0320 132then after it's revealed, the angel come down from heaven, which was christ (now remember, this angel and is on earth, a messenger). down comes christ (you see him in the 10th chapter of revelations.), puts one foot upon the land and the other one on the sea, rainbow over his head, eyes and, like--and feet like fire and so forth, raises up his hand and swears by him that lives forever and ever on the throne, that time shall be no more.and when he takes this oath, seven thunders utter their voices, and the writer... which when john was taken up, was supposed to write what he saw. he started to write down.he opened it up? and then goes on and said, in the day just before these seven thunders, all the mysteries here are revealed.now, i think that's been made just as clear, and we--and--and we're looking for that to happen. somewhere an anointed person in the last days to rise up. now, you'll hear a lot of fanatics and everything else, but that just--just tries to... it's the devil trying to take away from the real one when he gets here. see? but it'll be properly identified. you know what elijah was. and watch that, and you'll--you'll know. and then, when he... now, the elect will know (see?), not the others. they sure won't do it. they'll miss it a million miles.the--the bride hasn't had a revival yet. see? there's been no revival there, no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet. see? we're looking for it. it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again. he will send it. he promised it. now, now, watch. now, she was--she was dead.the fourth seal jeffersonville in 63-0321 145now... and then after these seven seals are completed, we find in revelations 10 there was seven mysterious thunders that john was commissioned to write but then forbidden to write those. and at the time of those thunders, we find christ, or the angel come down with a rainbow, and put his feet on the land and sea and swore that time had run out at that time.that's the way the church ages and seals and all the rest of it. and when anybody thinks that he has those seven thunders, if it don't compare with the rest of the word, there's something wrong here. see? it's got to come thus saith the lord, for this is the book; this is the revelation of jesus christ in its entirety.then the seven thunders utter their strange voices, and john was going to write... it was... john knew what it was, but he--he didn't write it, 'cause he was forbidden to write it. that's absolutely and altogether a mystery. it's not even in symbol or nothing. we just know he--it thundered; that's all.now, when moses went out there under the inspiration of god and said, "let flies come," flies come. he said, "let frogs come"; frogs come. see, what if he said, "let flies come," they didn't come? see? then he--he didn't speak the word of the lord (see?); he only spoke--he spoke his own word.he might've thought there ought to be flies, but there--there didn't any flies come because god hadn't told him so. and when god tells you anything and says, "you go do this, and i'll be right with it for this is my word," and he shows it in the bible, then god stands right behind that. and if it's not written in the bible, god stands behind it anyhow, if it's god's word. see? and then if it's outside of that, it's revealed to prophets. we realize that all the mysteries of god is made known to prophets and them alone (see?), amos 3:7.now, we had him coming last night with his great sword to kill. we find out that he gets killed with the sword too, the sword of the word. god's word, sharp, two-edged sword slays him, puts him right down. wait till them seven thunders utter their voices to that group who really can take the word of god and hand it there. it'll slice and cut. and they can close the heavens; they can shut this or do that, whatever they want to. glory.he will be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth; it's sharper than a two-edged sword. they could call for a hundred billion tons of flies if they wanted to. amen. whatever they say's going to happen, because it's the word of god coming from the mouth of god. amen.god always... it's his word, but he always uses man to work it. god could call for them flies down in egypt, but he said, "moses, that's your job. i'll just tell you what to do, and you go do it." he fully done that. see? he--he could've chosen the sun to call them; he could have caused the moon to call it or the wind to call it, but he--he said, "moses..." that--that... he chooses men. all right.they know the thunders will issue the thing 'course pretty soon.if that isn't exactly what the second elijah is supposed to do when he comes to this church in this day: restore back the original faith. i don't see how you're going to squeeze away from it. that's right. turn back to the true word. that's right.out of the millions... now, listen, church, close now you that is going to be confused on this. out of the millions in the world in the days of elijah, when jezebel and ahab was reigning in--in type of the antetype today--out of the whole world, there was only seven hundred saved of elijah's preaching. is that right? it's exactly.look, elijah never knew even one of them was that way. he thought he was the only one saved until god opened one of the seals and showed him the mystery of the book, that he had seven hundred that never bowed down to them creeds that they had. when god opened his book to elijah, he said, "now, wait a minute, son; i got seven hundred that's tucked around out there: got their names on the book since the foundation of the world. they're mine." whew.god opened the seals. that's the reason i think john was doing all that shouting the other night. he must've seen his name on there. you see, see? one day god opened...elisha, he had preached; he'd done everything; he'd--he'd--he'd preached his heart out, done everything he could, and still they just "hawed" him and called him everything and said, "you're the cause of all this. you're a spiritualist. you're the one who makes all this trouble to come. you're guilty," and everything like that. they said everything to him. jezebel threatened to cut his head off and everything else. that's right. everybody was against him.and then he said, "lord, after i've done all you told me to do. i've stayed exactly with your word. when you told me anything, i was fearless. i walked right into the king's face and everything else and told them, thus saith the lord, and you haven't told me a thing, and i've not told them one thing but what happened. and now, here am i, the only one left out of the whole bunch. i'm the only one left, and they're trying to kill me."god said, "i'm going to open up one of the seals and show you something." said, "you know, i got seven hundred back there that ain't never bowed a knee or joined any of them creeds yet, denominations. there's seven hundred of them ready for the rapture. see?" oh, oh, he said to his prophet, who he reveals his word to (see?), through the scripture, "i have seven hundred prepared names yet out of this generation, seven hundred of them. they have not bowed their knee to any (if i'd say it in this day) religious organizations and come creeded up in them."the fifth seal jeffersonville in 63-0322 162now, that's instantaneously on the mark, the power of almighty god to take a bloodstream and cleanse it out right like that and--and put the pulsation of--of new life back in there, because your--your bloodstream is your life, mortal, and the--create new cells and clean out the old. and--and what it is, it is absolutely... i'd say this: it is a creative act of the almighty god to take a--a bloodstream that's contaminated with cancer until the little fellow yellow and puffed out. and within just a few moments time, a brand new bloodstream...i believe, (i'm not going to speak it in his name; i'm going to speak it in my--in the revelation of my faith), what happened in sabino canyon the other day... i believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored, and the glorious power of the creator... i--i believe if he can make a squirrel appear that has no... here if the man or woman just got a part missing, and that's complete animal in itself. oh, he is god. i--i love him.but the way up is down in god.now, we even positionally showed by the tribal colors of israel and by the... how many heard the--or the seven church ages? i guess most have: two thirds of you. notice that even the nature of the beast was exactly a tribal emblem, which way the four... the twelve tribes, set four on each side or--or three tribes on each side. and the four beasts set and watched these tribes from all four ways.and when we went and got the gospels and show exactly when you enter into the ark, they was a-guarding the ark, the covenant; and then we find out that the covenant of the new church, its representation on earth was the holy spirit. the blood had sent back to us the holy ghost, and the four beasts represented as the--the twelve tribes of israel, as it watched, and finding their natures and taken that same nature and bringing it to each one of those four gospels, exactly, was exactly the same. one talked to the lion, the other one to the--the ox, and the other--the four gospels. there it is. the four gospels is the protection of the holy spirit. amen.now, who are these souls then? see? that's the next thing. who are they then, if they are not the early church? this is israel that's to be saved as a nation, all them that are predestinated. that's israel. that's israel itself.the prophets now are preaching to israel. see?)... till thy fellowservants also--thy fellowservant and also thy brethren, that should be killed... (see, the ones predestinated to be done, so you see, should be killed)... as they were, should be fulfilled.now, notice. thy brethren--thy brethren had to yet be killed, which means the hundred and forty-four thousand yet to be called in the tribulation, the hundred and forty-four thousand is called...they have to be martyred by the antichrist; we just come through, and notice in his last ride, where he breaks that covenant with them jews down there, and there she goes. see? these jews, a hundred and forty-four thousand, is to be called out by the two witnesses of revelations 11.now, you remember, they was to prophesy. you've read that. how many's read that? sure, we all acquainted reading the scripture. and they prophesy, these two witnesses prophesy in the time of daniel's second half of the seventy week. that is the last three and a half years.israel still had seventy weeks left, and in the midst of the seventy week the messiah would be cut off, and the daily sacrifice taken away (is that right?), but there was still three and a half weeks determined. in this block he takes the gentile bride. now, she goes up, and when she goes up, two prophets arrive to israel. see?the jewish kingdom is to be set on the earth, you know. john said the kingdom in heaven (see?), to be set... now, this is the kingdom of the gospel (you see?), but the kingdom of the jews will be preached by these--these two prophets. so notice the--the--the kingdom of the earth here. the kingdom of heaven is preached by the jews--or to--i mean, to the gentile. the kingdom of--here on the earth is to be set up in the millennium, after the millennium to the jews. now, notice. notice this now. here while they--while they are preaching (see?) before these--these prophets ever arrives on the scene, these jews that had to die under eichmannnow, notice. in the time of daniel, now, the second half of the seventieth week... now, remember, messiah was to be cut off in the midst. that's the middle. well, what's half of seven? three and a half. how long did christ preach? [congregation answers: "three and a half."--ed.] that's right. now. but there's determined yet to the people what? another three and a half year.but during this time, why, see what happens is the gentile bride is selected in the seven church ages and goes up, and when it does that way, all these jews that's martyred along there, because of blindness (laying under the altar) god comes over and says, "you see what it was? now, i'll give each one of you a robe."they said, "how long, lord? are we going in now?"said, "no, no, no, no. your fellowmen, the jews, has got to suffer a little bit yet. they got to be martyred like you was martyred. the beast has got to get them when he breaks his covenant."notice. the two prophets preached for three and a half years to the jew. in that, it's called out the hundred and forty-four thousand.and then, notice, these two prophets are exactly moses and elijah. see? now, look. look their--look at their ministry. now, watch what these prophets do. they have power to smite the earth with a plague as oft as they will. who did it? moses. they have power to shut the heavens, and it rain not in the day of their ministry. who closed the heavens for three and a half years? [congregation replies, "elijah."--ed.] there you are. that's them.these two prophets are moses and elijah according to their works being repatterned again. that--that has always been their ministry.'fore we get away from this, don't confuse elijah's fifth time ministry with his fourth time ministry. i've been telling you, the gentile church is looking for elijah. that's right. and here he is over here with the jew. remember, he can't come four. that's--that's the--the enemies number. he has to be five.now, the fifth time, he is a messenger to the jews, to the hundred and forty-four thousand, to the jews after the church is gone.but when he comes to the church, the bible--comes to the--the hundred and forty-four thousand, the bible plainly states that both he... there's two of them, not one of them, two of them.just think, that spirit of elijah ministers five times: moses, two. watch, keep alive for further service... they were neither one of them dead now. don't you believe that? they were both seen alive, talking to jesus on mount transfiguration. but remember, they must die.now, now, moses actually died, but he rose, 'cause he was a perfect type of christ. see? nobody ever knowed where he was buried. the angels come took him. see? he had angel pallbearers. why? no mortal man could pack him where he was going.watch and see if they're not both killed. yes, sir, they both have to taste death. yes, sir, now. after their ministry's finished, they taste death. revelations 11, and let's start at 7.and when they... have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit... makes war against them,... (oh, my. he can't stand; them holy rollers are back again. see, all right.)... out of the bottomless pit, makes war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. (but watch what happens. they're perfectly typed now.)and their dead bodies shall lie in the street--in the street of that great city,... spiritually... called sodom and egypt, where also our lord was crucified. (jerusalem. see?)now, they have to face death, don't they (that's right.) after their ministry's finished?look at moses' ministry. elijah was a prophet to all nations, but moses was a law giver to the jews only. moses is there to say... well, the reason he come with elijah...them jews saying, "wait, we still keep the law here." but here stands moses himself, and here's elijah standing with him. see, he comes to the jews only. see, moses only went to the jew. the prophet elijah was to all nations, but moses become a prophet to the jews and a law giver. see? that was his message: the law.the sixth seal jeffersonville in 63-0323 160this sixth seal is the tribulation period. that's what takes place. the bride has gone. see? there's no living creature, nothing there to say it. it's just... now, god is not dealing with the church no more. it's been gone. he's dealing with israel. see, see? this is the other side. this is when israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelations 11.remember, israel is a nation, god's servant nation. and when--when--when israel is brought in, it'll be a national affair. israel, the kingdom age, is where david, the son of david sets on the throne.in the time of the millennium, it's israel that's a nation. the twelve tribes is a nation, but the bride is in the palace.but the bride is in there with the lamb.all right, notice these messengers now... these messengers of the revelations 12, these two prophets, they're going to preach, "the kingdom is at hand." see? the kingdom of heaven's to be set up. the time, last three and one-half years of daniel's seventieth week promised to the jews, his people...and there is still a determination, that three and one-half years is still determined for israel.and he sent forth the first messenger, and he preached, and the trumpet sounded (as we pick it up after while); and then the trumpet was declaring war.trumpet always denotes war. the messenger, the angel come on earth, the messenger of the hour, like luther's, like any of the messengers that we've talked of. what does he do? he arrives, and a seal opened, reveals; a trumpet sounds, war declared, and away they go. and then the messenger dies. he seals away this group; they're put in; and a plague falls upon those who rejected it. see? and then it goes on, then they organize, get another organization. (we've just come through it.)then here they come out with another power (see?), another power, another age of the church, another ministry. then when he does that, along comes god with his ministry, when the antichrist comes with his. see, anti is against. they run side by side.i want you to notice a little something. just about the time that--that cain come on earth, abel came on earth. i want you to notice just about the time that--that christ came on earth, judas came on earth. about the time that christ went off of earth, judas went off the earth. just about the time that the--the holy spirit fell, the antichrist spirit fell. just about the time the holy ghost is revealing himself here in the last days, the antichrist is showing his colors, coming up through these politics and things; and just about time the antichrist moves hisself fully on the stree--on the scene, god moves hisself fully on to redeem his own (see?), just runs just right together, and they're both side by side.cain and abel, the crow and the dove on the ark, judas and jesus, and just on down... you can take it just...here was moab and israel, both of them. moab was not a heathen nation. no, sir. they offered the same sacrifice that israel was offering. they prayed to the same god. exactly. moab was call--was one of lot's daughters that slept with her father and had a child, and that child was called moab and from him sprang the moab race, the country of moab. and when they seen israel, their redeemed brother, come...they were fundamentalists. they were a big denomination. israel had no denomination; she just dwelt in tents and wherever you go. but moab had the dignitaries, kings, and so forth. and they had balaam up there, a--a false prophet. and they had all this, then they come down there to curse their little brother that was on the road to the promised land, going to his promise.now, that's exactly what taken place. then god dealt with the gentiles till he took out a people for his name. as soon as the gentile church is taken out, he taken up the church. and when he did, the sleeping virgin, the church itself (the bride went up.), and the church itself was put into outer darkness, where there's weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, and the same time the tribulation falls upon that people.and while the tribulation's falling, in there comes these two prophets of revelations 11 to preach the gospel to them. and they preach a thousand, one hundred and three score days. see? well, that's exactly, with thirty days in the month, like the real calendar has, is exactly three and one-half years. that's daniel's seventieth part--last part of the seventieth week.the tribulation period's right at hand, standing right here, and the seals being opened, the church ready to take her flight in the air, and the tribulation set in. then god comes down and pulls the hundred and forty-four thousand out of there. amen. there...oh, it's perfect. you see where the seals bring it out now (see?), open it up. now, this is the last three and a half years to the people. also, if you notice, it's the time that god will call that one hundred and forty-four thousand jews in this last three and a half years.see, he hasn't dealt with them at all. they haven't had a prophet. they won't believe nothing else but a prophet. you ain't fooling them. so they're going to hear a prophet (yes, sir.); and that's all. the god told them that in the beginning, and they stay right with it.he said, "the lord your god shall raise up a prophet among you like me." moses said that. and said, "him shall you hear. and ever who will not hear that prophet will be cut off from the people."but jacob said, "i'm not going to leave you. you--you can't go. i'm going to stay right with you. i want things changed here." that's that hundred and forty-four thousand, that money scheming bunch and things like that. when they see the true genuine thing to get a hold of, there stands moses, and there stands elijah. amen. they'll wrestle with god until one hundred and forty-four thousand of the tribes of israel are called out right there.that's just before the tribulation period. see? oh, how wonderful. also jacob's trouble. here is when the hundred and forty-four thousand is called out. they, the--the preachers, them two prophets, they preach like john the baptist, "the kingdom of heaven is at hand. repent, israel." repent what? repent from your sins and your unbelief, and turn back to god.it's israel.let me show you. now, remember, i said it's calling out the hundred and forty-four thousand. see? this time now it's when the--the tribulation which is to do it. and this is telling what happens in this tribulation.god calling israel. (see?) god's calling out israel. now, "sun as black as hair..." now, god was about to deliver israel there (all right.), bring them out of their enemy's hand, which was egypt at that time. now, here he is bringing them out of the roman hands, where they'd made their covenant. same thing happens. that's the plagues.the--the time that this plague will call, they'll plague this group of gentiles. if we had time, i could show what's going to happen to that gentile church. the bible said that the--the dragon, satan, was wroth (that's angry.) with the woman (the jew, israel); and he spurted water from his mouth (thickness and multitudes of people) that went to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed (revelations 13). now, see there? we have that. and that's when israel sends her, i mean, rome sends her army after the remnant, the remnant of the woman's seed.when israel is to be delivered, when the--the end of the seventieth week... and that's when they're supposed to be delivered. now, look. let's... we get to daniel 12 here just a minute.thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. (the predestinated, you see, that's written in the lamb's book of life shall be delivered at that time.)and many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, and some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and... contemptment. (now)and then shall the wise... shine as the brightness of the firmament; and--and they that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever and ever.his second son, israel, after the tribulation.now, let's stop here again and--and get something else, so 'fore we bring it into home. now, watch here these two prophets, look what they're going to do now: just like moses and them did down there. "and there was given me a reed, and..." (the 3rd verse of the 11th chapter.)and i will give power unto my two witnesses, that they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.these are the two olive trees,... (you remember that zerubbabel and so forth and was rebuild the temple)... and the two candlesticks that stand before the god of the earth.... if any man... hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth,... (you remember, out of the mouth of christ come the sword, word)... devour their enemies: and if any man shall hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.now, we know the fire in the 19th chapter, of the coming of christ, proceeded his sword from his mouth, which was the word (is that right?), the word. oh, if you'll get this material now for that seal tomorrow night... see? the word is the thing that god slays his enemy by. see?now, look here. when these prophets are prophesying, they're, they... if any man mistreats them, harms them, fire proceeds from their mouth, holy ghost fire, the word. the word is god. word is fire. word is the spirit (see?), proceeds from their mouth.brother, god rides on the scene here.they have power to--power to shut the heavens that it rain not in the days of their prophecy:...elijah, he knows how to do it; he's done it before. amen. moses knows how to do it. he's done it before. that's the reason they was kept back. now... amen.i could say something awful good right here, but i guess i'll hold it till tomorrow night. see? all right.... and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with plagues as oft as they will.what is it? what can bring these things but the word? they can do nature anyway they want to. here it is. they're the one who brings on this sixth seal. they uncover and open it up. it's the power of god to interrupt nature. see, the sixth seal, is completely an interruption of nature.do you get it now? there's your seal. who does it? it's the prophets the other side of the rapture. with the power of god, the word of god, they just condemn nature. they can send earthquakes, turn the moon into blood, the sun can go down or anything at their command. amen.it's moses and elijah, 'cause there's their ministry reimpersonated again: both men. oh, my. do you see it now? see what the sixth seal is? it's those prophets.now, notice. don't let it choke you, but watch what opened that seal: prophets. see? amen. there you are. oh, we're living in the eagle day, brother, head up among the clouds. they opened that sixth seal. they have power to do it. amen. there's your sixth seal coming open. see?here's the secret of it, the prophets, 'cause the bible said so here. they can open it any time they... they can do anything to nature they want to. and they do the same thing they did do (amen.), 'cause they know how it's done. amen. glory.watch them. if any man hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, the word. holy ghost come upon the apostles. you see? fire proceeded out of their mouth.these have power to shut the heaven that it rained not in the days of their prophecy...boy, that's interrupting nature. now, how long did--did this man elijah close the heavens for? [congregation replies: three and one-half years--ed.] there you are, exactly. how longs daniel's seventieth, last part of the seventy weeks? [congregation replies: three and one-half years--ed.] there you are, exactly.what did moses do? he--he--he turned the--the waters into blood; he done all these kinds of miracles, just exactly what's predicted here under this sixth seal. and here they are in revelations 11, doing the very same things. amen. there's three different places in the scriptures right there blending the thing right together. that's the opening of the sixth seal. right there it is. amen. glory.now, notice.these have power to shut the heavens in the days of their prophecy, that it won't rain; and... power over the waters to turn them to blood,... to smite the earth with plagues as oft as they will.oh, my. there you are. now, turn right over here to the plagues. see? all nature is interrupted in this sixth plague--or sixth seal open.he sent elijah to ahab, and seven thousand come out. is that right? he sends them right back over here again in the time of the tribulation and calls out the hundred and forty-four thousand. now, see, you notice, between revela--or between the 6th chapter, or the 6th plague, seal (pardon me)--the sixth seal and the seventh seal, the 7th chapter of revelation mathematically set together right...now, they're not gods. they're, temporarily the--amateurly they are, 'cause jesus said they were. said, "you call them gods who the word of god came."well, look. that's the one that god brings the word to. and when he speaks it, it happens. that's all. and here he is with a commission from god to smite the earth whatever he wants to. oh, my. stop the heavens, and he does. what's the matter? he's fixing to take the hundred and forty-four thousand out for redemption, out of the book of redemption. and that's under the seal of redemption, in the sixth seal. that's it, my dear friends. that's that sixth seal, been so mysteriously..."what will be the--these signs, and what will be the sign of your coming, what will be the sign of the end of the world?" and the sixth one there was the end of the world. and the sounding of the seventh angel raised up the hands and swore by him that lives forever and ever that time shall be no more.the earth is giving birth to a new one. it's over, and here we are right here at the door. oh, i tremble. and what must i do, lord? what--what else can i do? see? and then, just think of it, seeing that place and those precious people.questions and answers on the seals jeffersonville in 63-0324m 185don't try to make yourself odd to be a christian, because (you see?), you take yourself away from god and you--you--you... if you can understand it, this is that third pull. you should've caught that the other day. see. so then just...you remember, there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two.no, he isn't the same (see?); it's two different men. the elisha that come in the form of elijah was not elijah. and the spirit of elijah who came upon a man called john the baptist, was not elijah. and the man of the seventh angel messenger at the end of the laodicean age, will not be the literal elijah. he will be a gentile to his people.elijah will... the spirit of elijah then, coming in the--into the people there, he will be a jew (see?), for they are sent to their own people. that's my revelation.the reason i... of tommy osborn, when we talked that over that time (tommy and i); i never knowed. i was just praying for the sick, and i come up there, and there was a lady coming down from the fort wayne gospel tabernacle, a missionary in the foreign fields. her breast was that big--was just eat up with cancer; and she was right there in the little house where we used to live, up there in the lane. and i prayed for the dear sister, and she was healed and returned to the field.that's right. no, this elijah that will come to the gentiles will be a gentile anointed with that spirit, because god used that same spirit to bring his people out of chaos every time, and has served his purpose well, so he comes it right back down again, because (see?)--'cause now if he uses high-polished, educated, that's the kind it would catch.took--took him forty years to get it out of moses.one half of it was confirmed, the covenant, when jesus christ was on earth preaching to the jews. he never went to the gentiles at all. and he told his disciples, "don't go to the gentiles"; that was to the jews alone. see? and he preached for three and a half years--that's half of the seventy week, now, as daniel said he would do.now remember, he was firmly a-vindicated to the jews, but their eyes were blinded to bring in this space of the gentiles. can't you see the whole program? see? and he proved himself a prophet, done just exactly what the prophet would do, showed them a sign of prophet; which your own word said, "if a man says he's spiritual or a prophet, watch what he says; and if it comes to pass (just keep on coming to pass, what he said, continually)...then there is the three and a half years here that it will be confirmed to them again by prophets (see?), moses and elijah: revelations 11.24. brother branham, if all the... (now, just a moment. i guess what... pardon me.) brother branham, if--if all the godly (yeah.)--godly be taken up in the rapture, where will elijah and the--and moses come from?there's something wrong. there's something wrong. now, that's just all there is to it.24. brother branham, if all of the godly was taken up in the rapture, where will the elijah and moses come from? will they be jews, or will our elijah, given to us, be--be with them?no. the a--the a gentile that'll be anointed with this spirit to call out the gentiles will be taken away, 'cause, you see, the whole church, all has been taken up; and these two prophets of--of the 11th chapter is brought down; and the day of grace is ended with the gentile and been sent to the jews. no, it won't be the same men. i don't... i'm--i'm pretty sure of that. now remember, these are just the best of my knowledge.let's see what this--this says here.25. question. does the wheat and wine... (w-h-e-a-t... no, i guess it--it meant, "what does." it doesn't have a what there.) it just says: does the what and wine... or wheat and wine... what does the of revelations 6:6... let's see what it is when i get down here now, this here.and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts saying, a measure of wheat for a penny, and a... measures of barley for a penny;... see that thou hurt not the wine and... oil.i guess that's meaning the wheat and the wine, that was one to the other.... was a symbol, the wine taken at the communion table of rev--of i corinthians 11:24, does the wine--the wine... no, one of them is a spiritual symbol (see?), and the other one is actually the--the revelation of the word.now, just where does it say that--that--that the beast will deceive for the wealth; it doesn't say that. but we're presuming that that was... (now, the other night, you remember... you look to the tape real close.) i never said that's what they would do, i said... see, the catholics is the richest group in the world, nobody like them. and what they don't have, the jews has the rest.now, remember, this is william branham (see?), speaking. this is my idea. it's only presuming. just looking at it in the natural standpoint, which may be a million miles off, i do believe that right there in that money... the love of money is the root of all evil. and i believe that right along in there will start the ball a-rolling.33. brother branham, i understand that elias must be three times. you tell us that he has been twice already, and will come again. now, will the person that the spirit of elias will be upon, also be of the two witnesses of moses and elijah?no, no. he will be a gentile (see?), to the gentile church. god sends always to his own people. see? he came to his own, and his own received him not. he always sends his... the message of the hour...when god was dealing with the jews, there wasn't any gentile prophets come. when god's dealing with the gentiles, there's no jewish prophets. when god turns back to the jews, there'll be no gentile prophets. see? see what i mean? all right.34. after the rapture has taken place...now, there will be a carry over time, of course, one message carrying to the other one. it--it--it has to come right in like this (you see?), as i explained that (see?), like paul to the gentiles and so forth. all right.34. after the rapture has been taken place, will any of the church be saved in the end who was not taken in the rapture?no. huh-uh, 'cause the blood's done left. you see, there'll be no intercessions; the gentile age is finished. there'll be no one saved after the rapture, none of the church. huh-uh. the church... "let him that's filthy be filthy still, him that's holy be holy still." see? that won't take place, not after the church is gone.47. my dear brother, will the malachi 4:5 elijah go to the wilderness as i kings 17 tells us the other elijah did?well, i wouldn't exactly say that he would--that he would go to the wilderness, but he'd be this (you see?): he was elisha and elijah... did you notice, most of men like that are men who are away; they--they keep away from the people. they're very odd. they don't associate too much with people.you notice how elisha was, and elijah, and john the baptist, and that nature of that spirit. see? and they don't... he--he... i believe the man be a lover of the wilderness and maybe stay in the wilderness, but now just to say he's going to be a hermit and live in the wilderness, i don't know about that. sometimes they did. elisha didn't, but elijah did. and then, john, he--he lived in the wilderness.and hard tell, these other prophets, when they come out of judaea there, i don't know where they'll stay. they may camp out on the hill somewhere, or... but what they'll do in the days of their prophecy, i--i don't know what they will do, but you... what i'm trying to say is this: were--they--they will they a--will they be a--um--a...the seventh seal jeffersonville in 63-0324e 153original seventh sealnotice, how mysterious and how mathematically it fits right into the scripture (see?), exactly. you believe in god's mathematics? if you don't, you're sure lost in the... you'll sure get lost in the word. if you start putting a four or six or--or something besides just the mathematical words, running in order, you'll sure have in your scene a cow picking grass in top of a tree somewhere. you'll--you certainly run out, because god does not... his whole word does run completely in--in--in mathematics. yes, sir. perfect, the most perfect... there's no other literature written like it--like it--so perfect in math--mathematics.now, we can see what kind of a message that these two prophets of revelations the 11th chapter will preach. now, you clearly can see exactly what they're going to do. for the remnant, or the hundred and forty-four thousand predestinated, receives the seal of god.notice, god's one hundred and forty-four thousand elected jews don't bow to the beast, his denominationalism, statues, or anything. though their nation is in a covenant with it at the time, israel is in a covenant, but here's a hundred and forty-four thousand that's not going to do it. that's the elected.you see these jews begin to put forth their buds over yonder, when that israel begins to turn back, getting into her country, when she gets there, the church is ready to rapture, and there's only three and a half years left unto the end of the old world, and she goes out into chaos, and in comes the millennium to the new--new earth. said, "even at the door."now, one thousand years on earth is only one day with god. and three and one half years, what would it go to? so many seconds in god's time. that's the reason he said, "it is at the door." "verily i say unto you that this generation shall not be consumed (done away with, this people) until all these things are..." what? what won't be done away with? they've tried to kill the jew off the earth all the time. they'll never be able to do it.but notice, the very generation of jews that seen the return back into palestine, that generation would see these things happen. and just the last two years she was fully become a nation with her own money and whatever. there she is.now, where are we at, friends? the seals and everything opening, now we're getting this in between here. there it is. see where we're setting? i hope you get it. i haven't got no education. and i know what i'm talking about, but maybe i can't explain--explain it to make sense to you. but i hope that god takes the words that's mixed up and divides them out right (you see?), and lets you know what it is, 'cause it's--we're at the door. we're here at the time.now, notice. see, right away now he turns to these jews, and at the--the end time he says what's going to take place. we know even that... now we know; we are well aware that the tribes are scattered. they have been for twenty-five hundred years. they were prophesied to be scattered to the four winds. did you know that? we know that. 'course we won't have to go back and get--pick that, 'cause i've got something here real important i want you to see 'fore you get too tired and i get wore out.notice, we know even every tribe--that is, tribal chronology or whatever you want to call it, or geology or... the tribal positions are not no more together. they're scattered everywhere. the jews that are gathering into jerusalem is not... they don't even know their tribes. they haven't got any more tribal banners or anything. all they know then that they're jews. they were prophesied to be that way the world over.now, their books has been destroyed. they don't know... they say, "what tribe are you from?""i don't know.""what tribe...""i don't know." one from benjamin, one from this, and one from that. they don't know where they're from. their books has been destroyed through the wars, and for twenty-five hundred years... only thing they know, they're jews. that's all.but this is one thing he cannot impersonate. there'll be no mimics to this (see?), 'cause he don't know it. there's no way for him to know it. it's the third pull. he just knows nothing about it. see? he doesn't understand it.and i had my hands out, and all at once something hit my hand. i don't know. i can't say. did i go to sleep? i don't know. did i go into a trance? i don't know. was it a vision? i can't tell you. only thing i can say is when i... just the same thing like them angels was. and it struck my hand, and i looked, and it was a sword, and it had pearl handles, real pretty; and had a guard over it with gold, and the blade looked like, something like a chrome, like silver, only it was real shiny. and it was so feather-edge sharp, oh, my. and i thought, "isn't that the prettiest thing?" just fit my hand. i thought, "that's awful pretty." but i said, "hey, i'm always 'fraid of them things"--a sword. and i thought, "what will i do with that?"and just then a voice shook down through there that rocked the rocks, said, "it's the sword of the king." and then i come out of it. "the sword of the king..."now, if it said, "a sword of a king..." but it said, "the sword of the king," and there's only one "the king," and that's god. and he has one sword; that's his word, what i live by. and so help me, god, standing over his holy desk here with this holy word laying here, it's the word. amen.oh, what a day we're living in, what a great thing. see the mystery and secret? the third... standing there, when this left me, something just come to me and said, "don't fear." now, i didn't hear no voice, like on the inside of me spoke. i just tell you the truth, just exactly what happened. something hit and said, "don't fear. this is that third pull."third pull, you remember it? he said, "you've had so many impersonators on this, what you tried to explain." but said, "don't even try this." do you remember it? how many remembers that vision? why, it's all over the tape and everywhere. that's been about six years ago--seven years ago: been seven years ago. said, "don't try to explain that." said, "this is the third pull, but i'll meet you in there." that right? he said, "don't try..."i was standing with a--a little baby's shoe when he told me, there, "make your first pull; and when you do, the fish will run after the lure." said, "then watch your second pull" said, "because there'll only be small fish." he said, "then the third pull will get it."and all them ministers got around me, said, "brother branham, we know you can do it. hallelujah, brother branham." (that's where i always get tied up--with a bunch of preachers. see? i love people; they want you to explain everything, this, that.)and i said, "well, oh, all...?..." i said, "i--i don't know." i said, "i've understand fishing." i--i said, "now, the first thing you do... here's the way it's done. you see all the fish around; you got to jerk the lure." (well, that's exactly the tactics of fishing.) so i said, "jerk the lure." now, you see when i jerked the lure the first time, now the fish takes out after it, but they were little ones. that's just like they were catching. so then i--i said, "then you'll--you'll set..." and i jerked it out on the bank and i had a fish, but it looked like a skin over the lure; it just--he was so little. and then i was standing there and something said, "i told you not to do that." and i started crying.all the line was tangled around me like this, and i had--was standing there crying with my head down like that. i said, "god, oh, i... forgive me. i'm a stupid person. lord, don't... forgive me." and i had this line and that, what i had in my hand, was a little baby's shoe, about that long. and i had... that string was about as big around as my finger, about a half inch, like. and the eyelet in this shoe was just about the size of a--littler than one-sixteenth, probably, of an inch of the eyelet. and i was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch cord. and a voice come, said, "you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things." said, "now, let them alone."and just then he picked me up. and he took me up and set me way up high to where a meeting was going on, looked like a tent or a cathedral of some sort. and i looked, and there was a little box-like, little place over in the side. and i seen that light was talking to somebody above me, that light that you see there on the picture. it whirled away from me, like that, and went over to that tent, and said, "i'll meet you there." and said, "this will be the third pull, and you won't tell it to nobody."and in sabino canyon, he said, "this is the third pull." and there's three great things that goes with it, and one unfolded today, or yesterday, the other one unfolded today, and there's one thing that i cannot interpret, because it's in an unknown language. but i was standing right there and looked right straight at it, and this is the third pull coming up. and the holy spirit of god... oh, my. that's the reason all heaven was silent.now, i--i'd better stop right here. see? i just--i just feel checked not to say no more about it. see? so just remember, the seventh seal, the reason it was not opened (see?), the reason it did not reveal it, no one should know about it. and i want you to know before i even knowed any word about that, that vision come years ago. you remember that? and here it is just as this other has--slides right straight into the word exactly where it was. and god knows my heart; i never one time thought of such a thing as that, and here it was. it's later than we think.oh, my. just shows it's from god, for (see?), it fits exactly in the promises of god from the end of the--the message.you notice. notice now, for the end-of-time message, this seal. after all, he--he's revealed all the six seals, but it don't say nothing about the seventh. and the end time seal, when it starts, will be absolutely a total secret according to the bible. before knowing that... and remember, revelations 10:1, 7 (1-7, chapter 10:1-7) at the end of the seventh angel's message, all the mysteries of god would be known. we're at the end time, the opening of the seventh seal.now, how did i know the other day, last sunday, a week ago today, when i was preaching on "be humble, be humble; remember god deals in little things." i didn't realize what it really was talking about, and now i see it. it is in such a humble way. you'd think that something like that would be revealed to the vatican, or, but it comes just like john the baptist. it comes like the birth of our lord in a stable. glory to god. so help me, the hour is at hand. we're here. oh, my.now, do you see it? the truth of god's vision, the seven angels, bringing me from the west. they were coming from the west, coming back east, bringing here for this message tonight. oh, my.now, the voice of that great thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed that it--and proven that it was of god. just think now. i knew not these seals, and they been revealed this week. did anybody think of that? of those seven angels, being this being the message that was coming forth, them angels bringing me back here for that?remember, the seventh messenger was... the seven messengers was... the noted one to me, the seventh angel, it seemed more to me than any. now, see, they were standing like this (now, we just want you to notice.), and i was standing here, and i was watching those other... see, one... first bunch of little birds, feathers all beat down. you remember them? and they all flew eastward. and the second bunch were brighter, bigger birds, looked like doves, pointed wings; they flew eastward: first pull, second pull. then the next was angels.and as--i was standing right there, and this explosion left, and i was looking this way, towards the west, and they come and just picked me up in there, and i went plumb out of my knowing. and the one of them coming was the one that looked so strange to me, was the one on my, be to left where i entered the constellation at, but counting from the left to the right, it would've been the seventh angel (see?), coming across.now, remember the seven messengers. do you remember the pyramid of white rock of junior jackson's dream that i interpreted to you? notice, the night that i left... and i--there were six dreams came, and every one of them directly to the same thing. then the vision started and sent me west. is junior... he was watching... why, notice. look how perfect.now, i'm--i'm hoping and trusting that you people realize that i'm trying to put this grace on jesus christ, who is the author of all of it; and the only reason you never heard me talk like this before in your life... but this hour is approaching. see it?notice now, to make it sure to you, so it could be driven down... i'm fixing to leave you again. i don't know where i go. i must preach the gospel other places. but now, that you might say, "i've heard all that kind of fanaticism." i don't know what. i can't judge any other man. i only have to answer to god for what i--for--for myself. but has there ever been one time i ever told you anything in the name of the lord it wasn't right in all these years? nobody else can say so, because i always told it just the way he told it.now, let me just show you that this is exactly true and confirm it. now, remember, "if there be a spiritual... or a prophet, i, the lord, will speak to him in visions and make known to him by dreams," interpreting dreams. is that... joseph, he could interpret dreams and speak and--and see visions. is that true?now, notice this--that now, when this taken place, junior was standing in a field that had a--had a big pyramid to it like that, and there was something wrote on the rocks, and i was revealing that to the people. is that right, junior? about a year before it happened...and notice the next thing now. i took some kind of a bar and cut it off, and on the inside was white rock that had nothing wrote on it. and at that time i started to the west. and i told them all; i said, "don't go out west. stay here and look on this till i return." went west for the blast, returned back to the east with the holy spirit interpreting this unwritten word. now, if that isn't perfectly the god almighty, i want you to know what is. what am i trying to say this for, friends? is to show you we're at the end time.now, if them others is perfectly on the dot with the word, so is this perfectly on the dot with the word. we are here. we're at the end, friend. soon it shall be time run out. millions will lose their lives. millions will be--that now believe that they are saved will be counted fodder for the atomic age.we are living at the last hour. by the grace of almighty god, by his help, to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearing of christ... "how long, brother branham?" maybe twenty years, maybe in fifty years, maybe in a hundred years; i don't know. and maybe in the morning, maybe yet tonight; i don't know. and anybody that says they do know, they're wrong. see? they won't know. god only knows.now, notice. so help me, by god i tell the truth, that these are spiritually discerned to me (see?), discerned by the holy spirit. and by every one of them, has identified his place in the bible.now, what this great secret is that lays beneath this seal, i do not know. i don't know it. i couldn't make it out. i couldn't tell it, just what it and just what it said. but i know that it was them seven thunders uttering themselves right close together, just banging seven different times, and it unfolded into something else that i seen.then when i seen that, i looked for the interpretation that flew across there, and i couldn't make it out. that's exactly right, friend. see? the hour isn't quite yet for it, but it's moving into that cycle. see? it's coming up close. so the thing for you to do is to remember that i speak to you in the name of the lord: be prepared, for you don't know what time something can happen.now, when that gets on tape, which it is, that'll probably send ten thousand of my friends away from me, 'cause they're going to say that brother branham's trying to put himself and make himself a servant, or a prophet, or something before god. let me tell you, my brethren, that is an error. i'm only telling you what i seen and what has been told to me, and now, you--now, you do whatever you want to. i don't know who's going to--what's going to take place. i do not know. i just know that those seven thunders holds that mystery, that heavens was quieted. (everybody understand?)it may be time. it may be the hour now, that this great person that we're expecting to rise on the scene may rise on the scene. maybe this ministry that i have tried to take people back to the word has laid a foundation; and if it has, i'll be leaving you for good. there won't be two of us here the same time. see? if it is, he will increase, i'll decrease. i don't know. but i have been privileged by god to look and see what it was (see, see?), unfold to that much. now, that is the truth.and i'm sure that you've noticed the things that's been happening this week. i'm sure you noticed that little collins' boy laying there dying the other night, that little leukemia girl. the kingdom of god is coming. and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been. now, that oughtn't to choke people. from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost and then here--here. see? we're just drawing closer to god all the time.can't you see, methodist ministers, how that your message of sanctification was above that which luther preached? you pentecostals, can't you see your message of the baptism is beyond that which methodists preached? you know what i mean? oh, we've had a lot of things go forth, and that's right. and if there's anybody that despises wrong and people saying something that's actually lies and not the truth, i hate that; but i--i do love the solid truth. no matter how much it interrupts this way or that way, if it's truth, god will finally show that it's truth. and if he doesn't do that, one of these days soon, then my vision wasn't right. now, you see where i slayed myself."when will it be, brother branham?" i cannot tell you. i do not know. but one of these days, if we never meet again on this earth, we're going to meet yonder at the--at the judgment seat of christ. and you'll find out that in that room, the revelation coming from god (just like all the rest of them has), that them... one of the mystery of that seal, the reason it wasn't revealed, it was seven thunders that uttered their voices, and there it is perfectly, because nothing knows anything about it; wasn't even written. so we're at the end time; we are here.i thank god for his word; i thank him for jesus christ. for without sending him for the--the propitiation of our sins, we'd all be in a big muck of sin with no hope. but by his grace, his--his blood cleanses all sin. just like the drop of ink in a bucket of clorox, you'd never find the ink again. when our sins are confessed, it's put in the blood of jesus christ; they'll never be known again. god forgets them; they never was even done. and as long as that sacrifice is laying there in an atonement for us, then that's all... that's it. see? we're not sinners no more; we're christians by the grace of god.and remember, in our ownselves we'd probably be just as bad as we ever was, but see, the grace of god has appeared to us, and that's what's made us what we are today: christian brothers and sisters.this has been a tremendous week for me. i'm tired;then, lord, i pray that you'll help me. i--i--i'm beginning to fade away, lord. i know my days can't be too many more, and i pray that you'll help me. let me be true, lord, and honest and sincere that i might be able to bear the message as far as it's ordained for me to bear. and when it comes to the time that i must lay down, when i get down to the river, and the waves begin to come in, o god, may i be able to hand this old sword over to somebody else that'll be honest with it, lord, and will pack the truth. grant it, lord. until then, help me to be strong and healthy and courageous.**************************************************************************[you have just finished hearing the original "seventh seal" as it was preached in its entirety on sunday evening, march 24th, 1963 at the branham tabernacle in jeffersonville indiana. brother branham did not want this original recording released. the next day, monday, march 25th, 1963, brother branham went to the motel room of brother fred sothmann and brother james mcguire who were at that time in charge of making the tapes. brother branham told these brothers, "i don't want this message sent out the way it is." after listening to the tape himself, he instructed the brothers to stop the tape at a certain point, and at that point--(beginning of paragraph number 261)--recorded a new portion of approximately twenty minutes in length--(paragraph 377-414). this new portion was then used in place of the original ending--(paragraph 261-373). this recording was the only released version of the "seventh seal" until 1966. after brother branham left the scene, the board of the william branham evangelistic association unanimously agreed to release the tape originally recorded at the tabernacle. since that time, both versions have been available. we have now placed this additional message of brother branham on one tape, with the original "seventh seal." the next voice you hear will be brother branham in the motel room on monday, march 25th, 1963--ed.]will be a good thing that he doesn't know anything about it, because if he did, then he would impersonate that. that's his tricks in doing things. so therefore, god has made it so hid to the whole world, even to heaven, that there is no way of understanding it, only as god will reveal it himself.now, i want you to notice tonight that in the sixth seal there was a--a threefold purpose of the sixth seal. there was a threefold purpose of the horse riders. there's been a threefold purpose in all these things. that brings us back to a three and a seven again (see?), seven seals, seven vials, and so forth.now, in threes and sevens is god's number in his mathematics of revealing his word. now, you notice, like in the--the--the riders, now there was three horses went out. one of them was a white one, one was a red one, one was a black one. and then in the fourth horse, why, all of them was mixed together. see, a threefold purpose...now, god did the same thing. god did the same when he sent out his lion, which was his word to combat the antichrist. then we find out that he sent out the ox during the time of the--the tribulation period (the sacrificial animal); and in this tribulation period, that's all the people could do was just work, slave, and offer themselves for a sacrifice.then we find out in the next age, which was the reformer's age, god sent out the wisdom of a man--a man-like head on the beast, which was a power that went forth in the reformers.now, did you notice, every... no wonder that the people of these days still living the hangover, like it was, from the reformer's age, because they just see it in the ecclesiastical way of looking at it, and they see it in the way that their seminaries has taught it; that was god's way at one time, but we've lived a past that.now, we're into the age of the eagle, the revelation to be revealed, the whole thing. now, compare this with revelations the 10th chapter, verse 1 to 7, and we'll see here in this revelations--the revelations here, 10: 1-7, that in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel's message was to finish up all the mysteries of god.now, we find out also in this that the sixth seal now being opened, it was for a threefold purpose. now, here was the purposes: the first thing was that the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation period for purification. she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message. this she was done in the tribulation period. we see they wind up over here in revelations 7, between the 6th and 7th chapter here, that she had been purged, and she'd been given her robes.now, she's not the bride, but it's the church, the pure people that--that--that didn't have the opportunity, maybe, to receive the message, or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets, and they--they didn't get a chance, and yet they're really sincere in heart, and god knows their heart, and here they're purged during this time.you notice that another purging time; that's for israel when she gathers. that's the second fold. god purges israel in the tribulation period. out of the millions that'll gather there, there'll be a selected one hundred and forty-four thousand, and they will be purged also. god's purging israel.notice, there is a whole earth is to be purged. there will be such a thing that the moon, stars, and all nature will be purged. you see what it is? the earth is renewing herself, being purged, getting ready for the millennium. the millennium's coming up. and see, everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the sixth seal.now, now, do you notice on the opening of this seventh seal, it's also in a threefold mystery. this one i have--will speak and have spoke, that it is the mystery of the seven thunders. the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery. it'll be right at the coming of christ, because christ said no one knew when he would return.did you notice when the jews asked him that? you know when we compared the scripture here with matthew 24 with the six seals, the seventh seal was left out; because (you see?), christ said only god himself knowed, not even the angels. no wonder, it wasn't even written. you see, they hushed; nothing take place then. angels don't know it; nobody knows when he's coming. but there'll be a... there'll be seven voices of these thunders that will reveal the great revelation at that time.so i believe, to us who... if we don't know it, and we--we--it won't be knowed till that time, but it will be revealed in that day, in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in. so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before god and serve him, and do all that we know how to do, and live good christian lives.here now, we find that the sixth seal has been opened to us; we see it, and we know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrives.now, there was some reason that god let this seven voices be thundered, because it must come (see?), for the... we find that christ, the lamb took the--the book in his hand, and he opened that seventh seal. but you see, it's a hidden mystery. no one knows it. but it--it's right along with what he said: no one would know his coming; they also would not know about this seven thunder mystery. so you see, it's connected together.that much we have a understanding of it today, because the rest of it is all unfolded, but this is not unfolded. but setting in my room, and i heard this--or not heard it, rather, but seen it unfold to this seven thunders. now, that's as far as we can go right there. and now i trust that each and every one of you will serve god, and do that which is right, and love him all your life and serve him, and god will take care of the rest.now, we have in the completion here now, by the grace of god, all the mysteries of the six seals that's been sealed up, and we understand and know here that the seventh seal is not to be known to the public.now, his coming, and the hour of his coming, when the destruction of the earth... you know, he said there, "what will be the sign of the coming of the end of the world?" in matthew 24, there where they asked him that question, he went down to that. he told about israel being gathered as a nation in the 31st verse of matthew 24:31. but then he started off on parables. see? then, you see there, "learn a parable of the fig tree. when you see it putting forth its buds, why, you know spring's nigh." and then, "when you see this coming to pass, then know the time is nigh."see israel's gathering in its own homeland. but you notice, he omitted the revelation of this seventh seal. and here when the seventh seal, when he opened it, he also omitted it again. see? so we see that it is a complete mystery, therefore, the hour is not yet for these mystery to be known, therefore, we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that jesus appears on earth again for his bride, or whatever takes place at that time.now, until that time, let's just all pray and live good straight christian lives, looking forward for his coming.and now, if this tape would happen to fall into the hands of some persons somewhere, don't try to make any kind of an "ism" out of it. the only thing you do, you just continue serving god, because this great secret is so great that god wouldn't even let john write it. it thundered out, but he... knowing that... promising us that it would be opened, but to this time, it isn't opened.and now, we are grateful to god for what he has showed us. i've been setting in the room up there for eight days, and the message that i have just got through explaining to you, many of you here will understand, and i promise that there was something going on, spiritual, all the time, that i was sure you were missing it, and here's what it is: it's the absolute a-vindication of this interpretation of the scriptures being sent of god, because before we even went into it, and i left to go west, the lord showed me a vision one day about ten o'clock one morning, and i come and explained it here that i had seen it, didn't know what it was; it was a constellation of seven angels. we'll remember that. you'll get it on the tape, called, "what time is it, sir?" well now, that is exactly what you're seeing now.the seven angels... i was in the west. you remember the little bitty messengers; they went east. the second messengers, the doves (little bit larger bird), they went east. and now, i looked... they was with me all the time. that was that first and second pull. now, the third came from the west sweeping forward with great terrific speed, and they picked me up. that was coming back east with the mystery of these seven seals, just like it said in--in junior jackson's dream that the lord let me interpret for him there.on the inside of that pyramid, there was white stone that wasn't written on. that's the reason i had to go west to connect with these angel's message to come back here to reveal it to the church. you remember, i said, "the next things that happen will be here at the church." that's just exactly.another thing, i want you to notice what taken place, and if you're listening to the tape of the "what time is it, sir?" you will notice that one angel was very notable to me. the rest of them just was--seemed ordinarily; but this angel was a noted angel. he was to my left in the constellation in a form of a pyramid. and you remember, it was in the pyramid where the mysterious white rock was not written on. and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves, the mysteries of god known only to them. and now, they with the messengers that come to interpret that pyramid or that message of the secret of these seven seals which lays with inside the pyramid.now, the angel was to my left, would really be the last, or seventh angel, if we would count them from left to right, because he was on my left, me looking to him towards the west, him coming towards the east would be on the left side, so that would be the last angel's message: very notable. you remember how i said he had his--kind of his head back, and his great sharp wings, and how he flew right to me. now, that is this seventh seal. it's still is a notable thing. and we are... we don't know what it is as yet, because it's not permitted to be broken.but now, each one of you in the meeting has noticed that what a meeting it's been. everybody just seemed to be right on the end of their seat, and everybody standing around here at one and two o'clock in the afternoon waiting for the doors to open to get up here in the front, standing around the walls, cramped limbs, and everything. what is it? it's been the holy spirit sending down these messengers, and they have been revealing it to us. and then notice how it's dovetailed with the word, exactly.and then to let you all know that this is truth, he foretold it about--about two months now, or more, before it ever happened, that when i went west, not knowing it, come back here with the interpretation as he has given it.now, remember, in the vision, he never told me one thing in the vision when he took me up. i was scared, afraid i was going to die, be killed in an explosion. you see, they could not do it. the interpretation come just as i had need of it; that was in the room. and i gave it out just as he give it.now, you see, friends, visions doesn't fail; they're always perfect; they're just exactly true.now, the vision, plus the word, plus the history, plus the church ages; and all blend together. so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation, the interpretation thereof is thus saith the lord.**************************************************************************this ring-shaped cloud, at least 26 miles high and 30 miles across, appeared over arizona, u.s.a., february 28, 1963, and is referred to by brother branham throughout these messages on the seven seals.the feast of the trumpets jeffersonville in 64-0719m 126v-3 n-16now, at the evening time, or the mid of the day, when abraham was under his oak, three angels appeared to him. two of them went down in sodom, and preached the gospel, and tried to call them out. they wouldn't do it; they were perverted. lot, and his wife only, and two of his daughters started out; and the wife turned to a pillar of salt.but the one that stayed and talked to abraham, that abraham called elohim, the almighty (genesis 1, god; "in the beginning god," elohim, the--the all-sufficient one, the self-existing one, abraham called him elohim) and--he set down and eat with abraham; he drank; he was in human flesh. and watch the sign that he give abraham.now, they were looking for a coming son, a promised son, isaac. twenty-five years, on a long journey, they had looked for it; but they were at the end of the journey. god had appeared in many forms, as he has through the church ages, and lights, and so forth (as he spoke to abraham), and by voices. but just before the coming son arrived (now, we've been through it, and you know i'm just rehearsing to get this to you, that he changed the body of abraham and sarah, immediately after this, so they could receive the son.), notice, the last sign that they got before the son arrived, was jehovah talking to them in the form of a man. and how they knowed this was jehovah, because he said, "abraham (not abram; just a few days before, god had changed his name.), where is thy wife sarah (not s-a-r-r-a, but s-a-r-a-h, 'princess')?"and abraham said, "she is in the tent behind you."and he said, "i (that's a personal pronoun.)--i will visit you according to my promise at the time of life. (the next twenty-eight days something's going to happen to sarah.)"and sarah, in the tent, smiled in herself and said in her heart, "how could this be, seeing i'm old, and have pleasure with my lord, who is also old, abraham?"and the angel or the man said, "why did sarah say that in her heart?" in the tent behind him. "why did she say these things cannot be?" see? a man in human flesh like a prophet, yet it was elohim, discerning the thought that was in sarah's heart behind him.and jesus said, "as it was in the days of lot, so will it be at the coming of the end of the world, when the son of man, not son of god, when the son of man will be revealed."notice revelations 10:1 to 7, all the mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the laodicea church. has anybody got a revised version bible? if you have, you'll notice there where it said, the angel, it's in parenthesis, it says, the eagle (huh? see?), the messenger to the--the laodicea church (see?), revelations 10:1 to 7.and he said that this--in that day that he see him come down, and he eat up the little book. and there was... he put one foot on land and one on the sea and swore by him that lives and ever and ever, that time shall be no more. and when he did, seven thunders uttered their voices. and when the seven thunders uttered their voices, john said he was about to write; and he said, "don't write it." see? and he sealed it.now notice, the trumpets, that we're speaking of, is a call together for either a feast, for war, for a person, some sacred day, or something like that (notice, you said, "for a person?" yeah), or for the year of jubilee, the announcing of the coming of freedom, when they could go back. now, we could take a complete morning on just that one thing. but now, getting into the trumpets, you got the background now of the seals, and the church. now, we're going into the trumpet.the trumpet sounded; and the trumpet denotes either war, or feast day, or... what it means is a gathering together of the people, the trumpet. paul said, "when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who can prepare themselves for war, or for peace, or whatever it is?" who knows? you have to know what the trumpet sounds. therefore, when the trumpet sounds, we see something in the earth today. there's a great trouble somewhere; everybody knows it. everybody's become a neurotic. the whole world is a neurotical world, and we know there's something wrong. the pentagon, everywhere, we know there's something wrong.now, the only way you'll know what the trumpet sound is, is to look what the music sheet says. that's all. it's a great symphony (see?) and beating like "peter and the wolf." see? when you... if the... and the--the--the composer has wrote the book, and the director must be in the same spirit of the composer. if he don't, he gives the wrong beat, and then the whole thing's out.that's what's the matter today. we've got too many directors in the--not in the spirit of the composer. they say their denomination, "well, we believe this." no matter what you say, the bible is right. beat it out according to the sheet music right here before us, then the great symphony of god's great act is playing out just right; then we see the hour and where we're standing.now notice, the trumpet is to call together the people--assemble themselves together for something. sometime it announced a important person like in joseph. they sounded the trumpet and joseph was appearing, which was a--a symbol of the great trumpet (that we speak of and get to after while) in isaiah that says when that great trumpet sounds and the ensign will be lifted up out there, then there'll come a time when the great trumpet will be sound; and all the nations will gather to jerusalem. that's when the millennium starts, the great trumpet.the--this calling of the feast of the trumpets, the approaching of something... notice revelations 8 and 7, if you want to write it down. we notice the first trumpet there scattered hail, blood, fire upon the earth. just exactly with exodus, when god was calling his people out of the exodus.now, the reason that these seven trumpets does not apply to this church and this age is because it's to israel only. it's the calling of, the gathering of the people. and now, there's only one significance in here, that i want you to get to in a few minutes, is where you'll see why this doesn't apply to this age that we're living in, the seven trumpets.i know many people differing with that, but i know it's this... i--i know it... no, not because... i'm saying you're saying it, because i didn't get it from myself; my--my thought is not my own. ever what it is that told me, if it's wrong, then it's wrong. but i'm not telling it by my own; i'm telling by what somebody else has said. that somebody else is the god that spoke to us and done all these things that he has done, and appeared. see? so i know it's right. the--the gathering of israel is the trumpets. the trumpets is to gather israel.notice, the very first trumpet sound, blood, fire, hail, and everything scatter the ground. see? what was he doing? bringing israel out of spiritual egypt (see?) back into his homeland.now, let me say this right here, that every trumpet that blowed, blowed under the sixth seal. and we'll get to it in a few minutes where we caught the seal there. all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal, because the seventh seal there was silence. no one knew; that was the minute or hour that christ would come, as he revealed it to us. but every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal, under the persecution of the jews.notice, revelations now, 8th and begin with the 7th verse. all was the calling out of israel natural in egypt; now it's the calling out of israel in the spiritual sense. he was making them ready to come to the feast of the atonement.notice, the feast of the trumpets was first, which was pentecost. the feast of the atonement followed it fifty days later. the feast of the atonement, read it here, we'll--probably if we have time, we'll refer to it and read to you out of the bible here in--in leviticus 12--now--or leviticus 23 rather, and leviticus 16. we find that the first was the feast of the--of the trumpets was the atonement and the--after it followed pentecost. now, we find out--the feast of the atonement followed the feast of the trumpets.now notice, a trumpet sounded and that was to gather them together. now, the first trumpet blowed; there was hail, blood, fire sprayed upon the earth, just exactly like it was in egypt, making ready to call them to the day of the atonement. see? they rejected the true atonement, and this years has been lengthened out through here, has been the year of pentecost. see? now, the sounding for the jews comes next; this has been the calling out of the church (watch real close, now.), which afterwards he took them to the land of promise, which he will do the same thing, and which in symbol he takes the church to the land of promise. remember, every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal, only then when it sounded.notice, now, exactly the continuity of the scripture, exactly the same. under the seventh trumpet is to israel the same as the seventh seal was to the church. we find under the seventh seal, that when these souls that was under the altar there that received robes; they were given robes, not that they earned them, because they were in the dispensation when god was still dealing with grace with the gentiles, not jews. israel is saved as a nation; god deals with israel as a nation. gentiles is a people for his name, not a nation for his name, israel.and when hitler and them persecuted the jews, and did the things that they done under that... look, they... stalin, hitler, and all those dictators that raised up (if we had the time which to rehearse it to some newcomers, but we've went through it), under that same age, that there has been in germany and--and all the other nations... jews has scattered throughout all the land, but there has raised in the last twenty years a bitter persecution against the jews.i've been out there at the old places, where they burnt their bodies, and cremated, and used the--used their ashes to fertilize the ground, jewish children, and women, and everything. then they try to deny it. take them right out and show them where it was done. it's been a regular persecution against israel, because it's been the time calling him now back to the atonement; he is still under the atonement of a natural lamb. the real lamb of god is the atonement, and he's rejected it, and the blood's been upon him ever since.notice, making ready the people. how perfect then the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal is. perfectly together the persecution of the jews... note, in revelations the 9th chapter and the 13th verse (now notice real close.), under the sixth trumpet (revelations 9:13), under the sixth trumpet, note, there was two hundred thousand horsemen that had been bound in the river of euphrates was turned loose under the sixth trumpet. now, there's not two hundred thousand horsemen in the world, but there was two hundred thousand horsemen.notice it. (i want you just jot it down, so you can read it.) they wasn't natural horses. they breathed fire, and they had breastplates of jasper, and--and they had tails, and the end of the tail looked like a serpent, a snake's head on the end of it, stinging. see? it was spiritual horses, spiritual devils, chargers, that had been bound in euphrates all these years, supernatural devils. what was it? the old roman empire being revived, the persecution of the jews. and they'd been bound for nearly two thousand years at the river euphrates, can't cross to the promise, a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side. euphrates, you know, come through eden. but they were bound there, two hundred thousand devils of persecution.and notice what happens under that sixth trumpet. they were turned loose on the jews, the persecution of the jews. supernatural devils, nearly two thousand years, then loosed by stalin, hitler, upon the jews.you say, "well, that isn't roman." it's the same spirit that done the same things it did to the christians in the old pagan roman days (now, watch the natural israel and the spiritual church now, as we separate it here.) turned loose on the jews.you remember, under the sixth seal how every one of those martyrs are calling--according to the word of god receive robes? it was given to them by the grace, because they're blinded that they can't see the gospel, that this people might be called out of the gentiles for the--the bride. they were given robes; the bible said so under that trumpet, them jews, who absolutely is against christ and everything. the reason they are, is because the bible said they're blinded; and they were blinded for your sake. and the just god knows that they would receive it, but they were made blind for your sake. the bible said so.there's that roman empire bound there by what? the ecclesiastical powers, which rome, pagan rome become papal rome, and was bound there in its traditions of christian, what part of christian and--and superstitions it had of rome, putting together all these worship of women, and all these other kind of stuff, and christmas days, and holidays, and holy days, and things. it's been bound by that tradition that it cannot let loose, because it's against christian principles. still the same ungodly, pagan spirit... and that spirit caught into the nations of the world, according to the prophecies of ezekiel, and the rest of them. and they were loosed upon the jew, who knowed nothing of the spirit. there's your mysteries that's hid under that seal there. see?notice that we went through it. and that'll show you this trumpet here, this last trumpet, what takes place. there they are; these trumpets are let loose on the jews (don't you see?), not on the gentiles. the gentile, when them seals was opened is sealed away. time has ended; the church is called.you remember the vision the other day? remember the--the preview of it? how many remembers sunday 'fore last? how there it was exactly come by; we seen it exactly, seen that dirty, filthy thing come up called the church (vulgarity is to the extreme), and that little bride of every nation, each one of them dressed like their nation they come from, just perfectly, walking before the lord. you notice, there'll be a time some time when they'll say, "well, i thought the church was to go before the persecution. i thought there's a rapture.""it's already passed and you knew it not." that's what he said about john one time, you know.said, "how--why say the prophets that a--the scribes that elias must first come?"he said, "he's already come." and even the disciples didn't know it. "they done to him what they listed." the rapture will be the same way. in--in a hour... he's promised to do that. he didn't promise to show elias like that, but he promised to take the bride like that--in a hour that you think not, just a change in a moment of a twinkling of an eye be caught away; then you're left. then that's the time.two thousand years, this spirit through the roman people, the roman church, could not move. but that same spirit, coming up first down there into mussolini in rome, the dictator...you know the five--seven things he showed me in '33 would come to pass? five of them's already passed. doctor lee vayle's writing a book on it there now. see? five things perfectly, and just two more things to happen. said it'd happen just before the coming. here we are right at the end now, and look like that sixth thing's moving right up. see? perfectly, exactly, even the wars and how they'd happen exactly on the dot, and not one time did it miss.listen folks, we ought to take inventory every hour. we don't know where we're standing--real close.now, now, he loosed upon... under that sixth seal, these two hundred thousand spiritual demons, started in rome, germany--hitler. notice, over in the bible where they received--never--they received power as kings, but wasn't crowned. a dictator's not a crowned king, just receive power as a king.oh, the spirit of god is moving through me now (you know?) just saying something; i don't know how to say it, nor what to say and maybe i'd better not.notice, two hundred thousand demons turned loose upon those jews, when they burned them, they crucified them; they put bubbles in their veins; they killed them till they had no more gas to kill them with; and they shot them till they had no more bullets to shoot with; and they--and they done everything they could do. they cremated their bodies and everything, and hung them on fences, children and all, innocent people. because they were jews, they were done that way. but god said he give each one of them a robe, undeserving as they was, but his grace to blind them so that we could see...that seventh seal hasn't opened yet, you know; that's his coming.so while they're still under there... but he shows us here in the preview as john. he took him up and... one time walking on the sea, you know... he said, "what about this man that leans on your bosom?"he said, "what is it to you if he stays till i come?" see, he never stayed, but he took him up and showed him the--the things that'd happen till he come. just showed him, reviewed the whole plan to john.notice, we find now, that that natural power under the natural, to a natural nation, israel, was loosed there. and what did it? it went and made war, and how it murdered and persecuted.now in the ecclesiastical realm of it... i--are you... i hope that god opens your eyes to this now, 'cause i realize this is just not speaking to this church here; this tape goes worldwide. and i don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings, but just to tell the truth. now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural revival of the old pagan rome, went forth on those jews, which has always been their enemy (the lion with teeth and everything, that stomped down and broke out the people, rome), always been god's enemy. and it was turned loose in the same spirit by the dictators of the world, because the religious system was still holding; now it's been loosed.well, what has it done? in the cunningness, as he said, he'd come in like flatteries. and what has he done? he's bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world churches, the spirit of antichrist, upon both of them, bringing them to the slaughter, just like they did the other in a hour to call the bride. how? loosed in the ecclesiastical church, spirit. loosed upon what? not upon the denominations, upon the bride. but here you'd get it; the bride will not go through that time. the bible says not. the church will, but not the bride. can't you see? ministers, can't you see that, brethren?you say the church has to go through the persecution for the--for the perfection of it. the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride. a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment; he's already found grace to--with her; she's found grace with him. he--he engages to her. and if there's anything, he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand. his grace is so great upon them, and so will it be upon the bride, and so is it on the bride.we unworthy creatures, deserving of hell, but his grace holds us through it. looky how many lost and blind, how many--how many sinners was there in the world the hour i got saved. god saved me for a purpose, and i'm determined by his will to do that purpose. i don't care what anything else goes; i want to do it.and in the hour when i see all the churches, their great glamor, and rich and have need of nothing, they say; and see them miserable, wretched, blind, and then patting you on the shoulders, want you to compromise with them, i was born for a purpose; that's to condemn that thing and to call out. yes, i do.remember, when jesus came on the earth, there wasn't one-hundredth of the people on the earth ever knowed he was here. he come to get that elected group. said, "no man can come to me, except my father has drawed him. and all the father hath (past tense) given me, they'll come. they'll know it; they'll hear.notice, the loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit. now, twenty years later after that war, we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit, what under? the seventh seal, the seventh trumpet to the jew. look at the moon darkening out. where under? see it drawn out? the son of man being drove from the church. what is it? joining in with the ecclesiastical bunch. the--the ecumenical move, and with the world council of churches has drove every man... what does that thing stand for? why, you have to surrender all your evangelical teachings and things. how can two walk together less they be agreed? they can't. jesus said they can't. and how can a church of methodists and baptists walk together? how can the church of christ walk with the presbyterians? how can the catholic walk with the protestants? how can protestant walk with protestant? but the bride can walk with the word, which is christ; it must be in agreement, not the ecclesiastical system, but the word. you have to agree with the word to walk with the word. jesus said so; that makes it right.notice, there she is. now, she's loosed to call all these little loose ends. "oh, well, it don't make any difference anyhow." that's what satan said to eve, "don't make any difference. it's all right. surely, god's a good god; he loves us all." he doesn't.you hear so much about being a good god. he is a good god, but being good, he has to be just. there is no goodness without justice; there is no justice without no law, without punishment, penalty. so we're in that hour, that we're living.notice, quickly now, these supernatural demons. then under the--under the auspices of a united nations, united groups together, eastern and western... just like the right and left foot of the image that daniel saw, how they wouldn't agree and mix with one another; and the word "eisenhower," during that time, "eisenhower" means "iron"; "khrushchev" means "clay". and he pulled off his shoe and beat it [brother branham knocks on pulpit--ed.] on the desk at the--when the league of nations--or the--at the u.n.--khrushchev did. dusting off the...oh, my, the hour that we're living, the church and it's condition. but thank god, the little bride has made herself ready. it ain't long, just hold on. i don't know how long, don't know when (nobody knows that), but we know it's close now. we...watch the ecclesia--watch that natural, what it did to them jews. that was a people that held to the laws of god. no matter how many churches raised up, what else, they was blinded to christ and held to that law. and god gave them robes, every one of them, 'cause they went down in martyrdom. see? they--they--they were blinded for our sake.here now the church that knows nothing but the bible; regardless of the ecclesiastical system, denomination, they know nothing about it; it's all foreign to them. they know him and him alone.people today are somewhat like peter and them was up on the mount transfiguration. they got all enthused when they seen the supernatural did, and one said, "we'll make one church of--of the prophets, and one to moses." and that's the way the people, the pentecostals did. they said, "we'll make one, assembly of god; and one, church of god; and one, oneness; and one, "twoness"; and so forth, like that. but while he was yet speaking, jehovah cried out, "this is my beloved son, who is the word; hear ye him; he is the word."the hour that we're living, the ecclesiasticals, the spirits uniting together now and bringing them all to this big one slaughter to blot out; it's already in writing here in this nation now. and these churches has to be closed, unless you're with the organization. it's a union; it's a boycott, just like the mark of the beast. and now you see what the beast is, don't you? it's a power. and a power, a ecclesiastical power, jesus said it'd be so close like the real thing, it'd deceive the very elected, if it was possible. but he promised to have something here for us in that day, that we wouldn't be deceived, and that's the word, and christ to make it manifest to us.they're supernaturals devils unseen to the eye, but you can see what they're doing. see?notice, while that group is a-riding, making themselves ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them, there's another group being made ready after while: revelations 19. the next time the church is heard, she comes also, not upon exactly horses, but the bible said he was on a white horse, and the host of heaven was following him upon white horses. that right? while this group down here has got two thousand bound at the river euphrates, and has been bound for two thousand years, also that church has bound the holy ghost for nearly two thousand years, under martyrdom back there and under the church ages. it's been bound, not at the river euphrates, but at the door of creeds and dogmas, that the holy spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems. but she's going to be liberated; she's coming back. that's what the bible said. and those two meet one another on the battlegrounds: lucifer and michael again, like in the beginning.they've been bound for two thousand years almost, almost two thousand years. not exactly two thousand, 'cause the romans kept on going (that titus in a.d. 96, and on down like that) to kill the jews, the romans. who was it killed the jews? who was titus? a roman general. and the blood rolled out the gates down there, up to the--the... slaughter them little women, children, and everything. didn't ezekiel 9 say they'd do that? go through the midst of the city and set a mark upon the people who sigh and cry, the--the holy spirit. and the rest of them, the slaughtering man come forth, that would been bound ("hold them. hold them." until they went forth), and slaughtered everything that was in there. little women--women, children, babies, and everything else, they were all slaughtered. exactly, here it is again repeating itself. and here is that ecclesiastical system coming right back, smothering out, tramping out everything that's called god. oh, they got their systems, and organizations, and denominations, but that don't have nothing to do with the bible. they'll tell you quick they don't even believe in it. unless you say what the church says. it's what god says; that is the word.the bride is with the words; they're one. how can they be one? when that word that's wrote in there becomes in you, and you and the word becomes one (that's exactly what he promised.), then it interprets.god don't need an interpreter. they say, "well, we interpret it like this." you've got no right to interpret nothing. god does his own interpretation.god said, "let there be light," and there was light. who interprets that? he said, "a virgin shall conceive," and she did. that don't need any interpreter; it's already interpreted. god said these things would happen in this day, and it is. it don't need no interpreting; it interprets itself.oh, my. revelations 9:1, under the fifth trumpet their king... notice (revelations 9:1 now) the king of this great group of two hundred thousand horses. they had a king over them, and if we notice, it was a fallen star. "why art thou fallen from heaven, oh lucifer?" (oh, how dr. smith got that so scrupled up there, but it's all right. see? wasn't for his hour. see? all right.)... was a bottomless pit... their king was the king of the bottomless pit, revelations 17:8 (i wrote something down here; i'm just going to read it. you see here revelations 17:8, i want to see what it says here, 'cause i don't know just how to hit this next...), 17:8:and the beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and shall go into perdition: and they that dwell upon the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life of the--life--from the foundation of the world, when they beheld the beast which was, which is not, and which yet is.see? was, one pope dies, another one ascends--beast which was, which is not, which is, which is not, which is, don't change its order. pope, same time, everything--everything has to go in the same system.and it shall come where? to the bottomless pits. and the bible said here, that the leader of these fellows was from the bottomless pits, and that was their king; and he sets with a triple crown and joining the protestants with him.heard a luther priest say the other day, said--or a lutheran preacher said, "well, people ask me why i wear a--a collar. how can they tell me from the..." was you there? yeah, wasn't that--wasn't that ridiculous? i--i almost felt like vomiting, walked off the platform. they said, "so there shouldn't be any difference."if luther, martin luther'd hear that, he'd turn over in his grave, say, "you hypocrites, you don't belong in my ranks." see?but you know where it's got? "there's no difference."there is a difference, even difference in individual. god said, "separate me and paul and barnabas (that's right.) for the work..." separate--god's a separator, not a mixer, a... peter... the church wants a good mixer today that can let them wear bathing suits, and shorts, and everything else, and get out and carry on like that. but god said, "separate me." separate yourself from the world.revelations... we find out here that their king was from the bottomless pits and the same one that went into perdition, in and out, in and out, went out. notice, in leviticus the 23rd chapter, how perfect is the interpretation with the order with the word, with what we're trying to give now. watch this now, the order.now, we notice... let's just turn and read that just for a moment. in ecclesia--not in ecclesiastes, but leviticus, leviticus 23. now, notice this here, leviticus the 23rd chapter. now... (and we want not to miss this at all now, so we can get it just exactly the way the lord's got it written here for us. i certainly can't find leviticus in exodus, can i?) all right leviticus now:and the lord... (23rd)... the lord spake unto moses, saying,speak to the children of israel, saying, in the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, and a holy convocation... (see?)ye shall do... the servile work therein: but ye shall not offer... offerings made by fire unto the lord--and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord... (now, watch. now, notice.)and the lord spake... moses, saying,also in the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be a day of an atonement:...see? the atonement followed the... watch now. the atonement followed the trumpet sound. see? how beautiful. see? the atonement day followed the trumpet. now--now, the fifty days of the trumpets for us symbolize when the trumpet sounded at pentecost, which was fifty days. now--now--now, after this, the jews rejected that; now the trumpets is to call them back to that atonement (see?), the atonement they rejected. and they rejected, so our eyes could be opened; theirs was closed. and during this time, these seals opened up and the--the--the trumpets blowed. and now, in the blowing of the trumpets, just before the messiah comes, 'cause they've got to be in palestine. and you remember god had to harden pharaoh's heart to run them out of egypt; and he hardened stalin, mussolini, and all that to get them back into the promised land, where the one hundred and forty-four thousand's supposed to be. and now, for the first time for thousands of years, twenty-five hundred years, that israel is a nation with its own flag, own army own--and it--considered in the--in the u.n. first time it's been... the oldest flag that ever flew on earth, at this time flies again. the five--six-point star of david. he said he'd lift that ensign in the last days, when she'd be coming back. we're at the end. there's just no doubt about it; we're here.notice, now quickly revelations 9 (under the seventh trumpet, their king is from the bottomless pits), and in leviticus now, how perfect the interpretation is here with the word, because (see?) immediately following the pentecostal jubilee followed the day of an atonement. the order of the feast time, between the pentecostal feast to the atonement, the sound of the trumpets for the atonement was the pentecostal feast, the long period of time.look, there was a long period of time between the pentecostal feast to the calling of the--of the trump--the sounding of the trumpets, the--the trumpets to be sound, a long period of time. frankly, it was fifty days from the--from the--from the feast of pentecost to the feast of the atonement, was fifty days. now, fifty days is exactly seven sabbaths. and seven sabbaths is the seven church years--church ages. get it? see, see?now, the jews has been blinded, waiting all this time, while the pentecostal firstfruits has been poured out upon the church. and we've come down through the martyr ages, and down through the reformer ages, and now in the calling-out age, three sections, same spirit, like father, son, and holy ghost, same one. see? but seven church ages, being seven sabbaths, exactly seven sabbaths from the--from the pentecostal jubilee trumpet--a pentecostal jubilee feast, until--the waving of the sheaf, and then the pentecostal jubilee. and then from the jubilee to the atonement is seven sabbaths, fifty days. and at the end of the fifty days is--the atonement is made. you get it?now, in the... this has been a type that the church, when he's revealed hisself as son of god, has been revealing to the church in the baptism of the holy ghost down through the ages and the pentecostal age. see? just keep getting more and more: justification under luther, sanctification under wesley, baptism of the holy ghost; now here's the calling-out time.at the sixth seal when it--when it opened, the persecution struck the jews in a literal standpoint, and here comes the persecution to the church in the ecclesiastical standpoint, because the bride is already called. the sabbaths are over and ready for the jews to be called. where to? the feast of atonement. oh, church, don't you see that? called to the feast of the atonement, what? to recognize the atonement, not no more chickens, and geese, and what they've been doing; the lamb of god, slain from the foundation of the world. israel's going to know that.notice, here's a great thing. look. oh, my, the holy spirit has been bound by the denominations all these two thousand years. we find out it has. now, notice the sabbaths, seven sabbaths; they couldn't get all the way out. the--the bible said there will be a day that will be neither night or day. and all scripture, jesus said, must be fulfilled. is that right? say "amen." [congregation replies "amen"--ed.] the prophet said there'll be a day that can't be called day or night, but in the evening time it shall be light. what was it? the same sun that shines in the east is the same sun that shines in the west.every time that sun comes up, and goes across, and sets, means your life. little baby born weak of a morning; about eight o'clock it goes to school; eleven-thirty it's out of school, it's the heat of the day; then it begins to set to fifty years old; sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety she sets over yonder and dies; only to come back the next day for there is a life, death, burial, resurrection.and notice, civilization has went with the sun. the oldest civilization we have is china (anyone knows that). where did the holy ghost fall? on the eastern country on eastern people. and the gospel has traveled with the sun. it come from where? from over in the east into germany; from germany to england (crossed a channel three times); mediterranean into germany; from the mediterranean--from the east into germany, through the mediterranean; from germany across the english channel into england; from english channel across the pacific over into--or the atlantic over into the united states; and now, she's at the west coast. she's crossed the nation that she's civilized, and went across, and went on. civilization traveled; the gospel's traveled with it. now, all the riffraff's on the west coast, where everything had picked up, like the tidal wave coming in.but the prophet said the sun will not shine through this day; it'll be a day of gloom. they've had enough light, like a real rainy day; they could join churches, and believe the lord, and things like that; but he said in the evening time the clouds will move away; the denominations will fade; and the same gospel, the same word made flesh (as he promised in luke 17:33), the same gospel with the same thing would take place in the evening time, just when the shadows are getting low.the same gospel, the same christ, that lived in flesh back yonder at the beginning on the eastern people, shall live again in the western people at the end time. "it shall be light in the evening time." all scriptures is given by inspiration and cannot be broken. the big fifty days has passed over; the pentecostal feast has passed over. seven sabbaths, until the trumpets, a type of the seventh church age.remember, remember, the--under the sixth trumpet the jew (are you listening?)--under the sixth trumpet the--the pentecostals reject the bible, the--the lukewarm, not only the pentecostals, all the rest. the church world rejects christ, and he's put on the outside. and in the same trumpet--or the same seal, rather, when it was opened, they showed jesus on the outside of the church trying to get back in; at the same time the trumpet sounds for the jews, and the jews recognize the atonement. glory. hallelujah. oh, my.the holy spirit's been bound by these denominational rivers for almost two thousand years, but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message: the holy spirit back in the church again, christ, himself, revealed in human flesh in the evening time. he said it; he promised it.there was three stages of it, as i said: the martyrs, age the martyr for it, and then the stage of the reformers, and now the calling-out time. when finished, the laodicean age, according to revelations 10, the mystery of all the bible would be knowed to the bride. is that right?revelations 10... listen close now. bride called out by the word, christ himself calling out the bride, making plain hebrews 13:8 (that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, does the same, is the same; "he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also." see?), luke 22--or luke 17:30, and also malachi 4, hebrews 4, all these scriptures that's promised, this is to be between the sixth and the seventh seal and the sixth and the seventh trumpet.pentecost feast finishes at the period of the seventh trumpet, for the next is the coming of the--or seventh seal, for the next is the mystery of the coming of christ, and also the trumpet is sound for the jews. their sixth trumpet is sound, and when it does, it makes known to them the revealed son of god. one-half hour is fixed. remember, all trumpets sound on this sixth seal. the sixth seal finishes the mystery--under the sixth seal just before the seventh opened.notice, here's leviticus 23 and 26. how in order is the scripture. after the long period of pentecost, which israel did reject back there... and he called the gentile church out through this pentecostal feast.how many understand what the pentecostal feast is? it's the fruit of--firstfruit of the harvest, the firstfruit of the resurrection, the pentecostal feast.don't miss this people. and you on tape listen close. this has been the time of pentecostal feast. the jews has laid silent; they rejected it. now, they've got to be called back to the atonement. we know who the atonement was; they didn't. and the trumpet sound after the pentecostal jubilee calls the jews together. can't you see how that trumpet of persecution under hitler and them blasted, and the jews was forced to come together to fulfill the scriptures? now, you got it? all that's got it say, "amen." [congregation replies "amen"--ed.] good. all right.notice, here in leviticus 26 now, the order of the scriptures. after the long period of pentecost, which ends in the calling out of the bride... the bride is called out by a servant, the rejected. next to be known to israel, the feast of the atonement. notice, here is the same as in leviticus the 16th chapter now, when he ordered the feast of pentecost--or the feast of atonement. but in this place they are called (oh, how perfect; see it preacher? don't miss it, ministers.), in this feast of pentecost, which is represented in leviticus 23:26--or 23 and 24, is a feast of mourning, not a killing of a feast. the feast was killed--the atonement was killed, rather, the atonement was killed (leviticus 16, it's exactly a parallel to it.), only in this place it's called israel to mourn for their sins.how perfect it is today. it's not the rekilling of it (which moses symbolized in striking the rock the second time; it didn't work), not a killing of a beast, but a mourning of rejecting the atonement. oh, my.this will be the trumpet, the feast be a rejected, then their messiah made known. notice. they'll know their messiah when they see him. he's coming in power this time, the one they looked for. he's coming in power for the gentile bride, and the jews are going to recognize him. and then the bible says (we just got through preaching on it here, about six months ago or more.), the bible says when they say, "where did you get those wounds? (how many remembers the message, raise your hand. sure you do. see?) where'd you get those wounds?"he said, "in the house of my friend."remember me preaching on the--the time when jacob had sent the children of israel down there to get the stuff, and the food, and stuff; and how joseph act like he didn't know them; and how all these things went on, then he made hisself known? you remember? and they were so scared they went to weeping, same as jacob's trouble. and here we find the jews under persecution don't know where they stand now.but they're coming back; and when they do see the atonement appear, the bible said when they see that, they said they'd separate one home from another and weep for days, like a--like a family that's lost their only son. "where did you get those wounds?"he said, "in the house of my friend."remember, the bride's already in heaven. joseph's wife was in the palace, and joseph dismissed everything from around him, and he made himself known to his brothers. you see? his wife, and children, and them was in the palace when he returns back to make himself known to the jews. there's the atonement, there's your sound trumpet. there's where they say, "oh..." what is it? there's the atonement. "where was them wounds come from?" there it is."in the house of my friend."remember what joseph's brother said? why, they said, "now, we'll be killed sure enough. we did that; we did the evil"--like that.he said, "no, god did this to save life." you remember the story in genesis? see, see? so did he do it this way to save the life of the gentile, the bride.said, "i got them in the house of my friend, but don't be angry." see? "don't be afraid." he's tell...they said, "oh, my. did we actually miss seeing him? was that the atonement, and we've missed it? oh, god." and they said they just separate themselves and mourn for days. what is it? the atonement, sadness.this time, the coming of the--making known atonement, is not the regular atonement being killed, like in leviticus 16, but leviticus 23 is a mourning time of their sins; and their sins was, they rejected it.oh, don't you see where we're at? don't you see why them trumpets means nothing to us? they all sounded under our sixth seal. you see now why the holy spirit wouldn't let me speak it? when the heavenly father knows, with this bible before me, that's the truth. didn't know it till yesterday--day before yesterday, in my room there where he revealed it, come to me and spoke to me. i come back; i said, "wife, i got it now; he just met me in there and told me. here it is, honey." see? there it is (see?), perfectly just in harmony.oh, people without him, get in quick; it might be the last opportunity you'll ever be able to have. you don't know what time he might come.the feast of the trumpets... the bible says they'd separate themselves one for another and pray and weep, because--like a person with their only child being lost.look. i want to say one more thing. closely now, don't miss this. how striking. from the seventh angel's (messenger of the seventh seal) message (and revelations 10 was the seventh seal) to the seven trumpets, between those two times... oh, god, how can we say this to make the people see it? it's between that sixth trumpet (and the sixth trumpet--and the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sounds at the same time), and between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet, there is a prophet to appear before the gentiles to call the people back to the original pentecostal doctrine; and the two witnesses of revelations 11 appear to the jews to send them to jesus, while the church is being taken up--all of them prophets. amen. the word of the lord cannot be broken. it won't be a denomination. do you see it?read in your book here and see if that between the sixth and seventh trumpet isn't injected in there with the jews being called out. between the sixth and seventh plague, we come over with that one hundred and forty-four thousand (you remember that?), which was between that. do you remember between the--the--the sixth--the fifth seal and the sixth seal--between the sixth seal and the seventh seal, there was a calling out of the one hundred and forty-four thousand. you remember that? now, there's where these trumpets come in, right there (see?) and persecution of horses loosed on there.then between that--then there was to be the seventh angel's message that had been preaching and condemning the pentecostals. and jesus had been put out, wouldn't have no cooperation with nobody, be put on the outside, rejected (the bible said so.); for it's christ made manifest among us, jesus among us all made manifest in the purity of his word, making it known. and if that... this is not just makeup, friends, this is thus saith the lord, the scripture.and at the same time... now, as soon as this church, the bride is drawed together, she's taken up; in that mystery of the seventh seal, or the seventh seal, the mystery going. and the jews is called by the mystery of the seventh trumpet, which is two prophets, elijah and moses. and they come back, and there's where the pentecostals is all mixed up. they're looking for something to happen, and the church is done gone, and that's to the jews.now, i feel in somebody's mind saying that couldn't be moses. yes it is. now, you remember, he can tell me your thoughts. i keep feeling that... all right.let me straighten that out for you. it was moses, 'cause here's your thought: you say that moses--it couldn't be moses, 'cause moses died. you think it's elijah; it's elijah true, when you think it's enoch. you say, "moses is already dead." but remember he could come back to life again; he did, eight hundred years later. several hundred years later he appeared on mount transfiguration. you say, "after a man's done dead?" yes, sir. lazarus was dead, raised again, and then had to die again. sure. even the wicked will be raised up to life again and then have to die the second death. is that right? so get that out of your mind; it is moses.watch your ministry, just exactly what moses and elijah done; closed the heavens and sprayed fire upon... you know what the thing they done.think of it. it's the end time, folks. hallelujah. the great day of the lord is at hand. gather yourselves together. feast of the messiah, they'll reject him, and they'll find out that there is their messiah. the bible said them striking things like this would take place.in revelations 11 call, their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling to israel out of the jewish traditions, just as the seventh angel's message called the bride out of the pentecostal traditions. remember moses and elijah is to call israel out of the old atonement of the lamb, and sheep, and blood, and goats, and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice, to the word.and the seventh angel's message, under the same trumpet, same everything exactly, the same seal, is to what? call the people, the bride out of the pentecostal and world traditions to the genuine atonement, the word, christ, impersonated in his word here, made flesh among us.science has proved it by pictures. the church knows it the world around. we firmly know it, for he's never told us one thing as thus saith the lord but what came the truth. did he not say down there on the river, "as john the baptist was sent, so will this message call out..."i looked up and see it is twelve o'clock. the midnight hour is here, friend, upon us. see how perfect the scripture is? perfectly how it--that...look, that's not going to be some organization go down there and call the jews; it's going to be two men, moses and elijah, both of them prophets.now look, to call the gentiles, the bride out, he promised malachi 4 to do the same thing. and the bible said he'd be put out of the church in the seventh church age. he'd be put out of the church; it go completely black and go... where does it black out? it goes into this ecclesiastical system, into this ecumenical council, world council of churches. she... he's put completely out, his word. they can't agree with it; you know they can't; they can't even agree in their own little local groups. how are they going to agree in that? so they take another mark of the beast, a image unto the beast.remember, the bible said there was a image made unto the beast. and this united states has always been number thirteen. it started with thirteen states, thirteen colonies, thirteen stars, thirteen stripes; number thirteen and always a woman. she appears in the thirteenth chapter of revelations. at first he was a lamb: meekness, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and so forth; and then he received power and spoke with all the power the dragon had before it. what is it? what was the dragon? rome. see, had a mark, a image of the beast to raise up against the real church of god; under them denominations will plague this thing, but when they start to do it...the lamb shall take his brideto be ever at his side,all the host of heaven will assembled be;o 'twill be a glorious sight,all the saints in spotless white;and with jesus they shall feast eternally. (amen.)"come and dine," the master calleth, "come and dine;"... (amen.)what a day we're living in, hour. run, people, run for your life.notice now, in closing, the ministry like the seventh angel, this two witnesses, they'd under that seventh trumpet just before--the sixth trumpet, just before the seventh trumpet find...now remember, and i told you i'd bring back this great trumpet... he said, what would he do over here in isaiah? he said at the great trumpet would sound (the great trumpet not trumpets now, feast of trumpets, there's two of them, moses and elias to call the trumpets), but under the great trumpet (the coming of the lord, to announce joseph returning. see?) that all nations would assemble at jerusalem. amen. you find that in the book of isaiah; i just give it to you awhile ago, one of those chapters we read. that's in isaiah 18:1 and 3.and in isaiah 27:12 and 13 is where he sounds that trumpet and all of the nations will recognize israel's in her homeland, god with her. then the bride will come to be with the bridegroom, and the bridegroom with the bride (and then the great millennium, after the whole world is destroyed by atomic power; and there'll be a new heavens and new earth) shall live forever.look right under... now, notice. the ministry of moses and elijah will... now, everybody get it? let me say it again. the ministry of moses and elijah, between the sixth and seventh trumpet, will be two prophets that will... they... israel always believed their prophets.now, why did the holy spirit say to me (when i started up to there to show them that he was the son of god), said, "not yet"? you remember that about five years ago on my way to india? said, "don't do it."i said... they said, "if this be the messiah, let us see him do the sign of the prophet; we believe the prophet."brother lewi pethrus and them sent me those bibles, when he give a million of them out to them jews coming from iran and everywhere coming back, assembling themselves together, become a nation.i thought, "this is my time." i was already in cairo, egypt. he said, "don't do it now; the hour is not yet." then i returned home.oh, my. moses and elijah's got to call. the pentecostal jubilee's still going, or had up till this time. see? now, the feast of trumpets has to be known. and this one over here of malachi 4 is not connected with that one over there: not at all, not at all.notice. watch here. the ministry will be moses and elijah, changing and calling israel from the jewish traditions (listen.), from the jewish traditions that they been mixed up in (being prophets, they believe--they'll believe him), calling them to the feast of the atonement (christ), letting them recognize christ. they'll say, "he's coming, he'll be here." the jews will be gathering, things like that, and then when he comes say, "here i am." see?"where'd you get them scars?""in the house of my friends."now, the same as those two prophets did... remember, the gentile bride is to have a prophet called elias (elijah) that's to call them out of their traditions, the bride, just the same as these prophets call jews out of judaism to christ the atonement. and the gentiles already knows the atonement, but it's to call the bride back to the original atonement, where these fifty sabbaths, oh, these seven sabbaths, that they have got away from, call them back to the end time.the seven (listen.), the seven church messenger, the seven trumpet messenger is all prophets. now, that's right. injected is the one hundred and forty-four thousand. calling the seals, which was to the gentiles... it had to be to the gentiles, to open up the gentiles to see the gentile church. that's all we know; that's all we are listening to; what's already passed. we look for jesus.you say, "now, wait a minute, brother branham, i believe they are going to do this."the last sign that abraham (and we are the royal seed of abraham, the bride), the last sign that abraham ever seen before the promised sign come--the promised son come was what? god in the form of a human being, that could discern the thoughts of the people: one man, not a dozen, one man. no matter how many impersonations, they had one, and he discerned the thoughts that's in there. what? and the next thing happened, abraham and sarah turned back to a young man and woman. we know that.now, i know that kinda chokes you a little bit now; but remember, just so that you'll be sure to know now. you don't read the bible like this; you read between the lines and (see?) make the picture come.watch. sarah was an old woman; the bible said they--her womb was dead. is that right? abraham's life was dead in him, his seed. is that right? now remember, abraham's seed was dead. forty years later he had seven sons by another woman. what did he do? he changed their bodies.watch. they took a three hundred mile journey down to gerar, quite a long journey for an old man, couldn't... and sarah even thought they couldn't have family relations. she said, "me..." (twenty years or more maybe before they had family relation.) said, "me, an old woman, and my lord also, have pleasure again like young people?"he said, "is anything too hard for god?"notice, what happened? immediately she turned back to a lovely young woman, showing in there, portraying what he's going to do to the royal seed of abraham to receive the son that's been promised. she turned back to young... look. they went out into gerar and what happened? abimelech the king fell in love with her, said, "she's fair and beautiful," and was going to marry her (is that right?), old grandma, and all them other pretty girls down there: granny. "she's beautiful, she's fair to look upon." see?god changed her body and turned them back. it's a mystery that's to be revealed now in this day by the son of man (see?), the evening message. see? turned back... and that was the last sign they seen was what? that discernment before the change of the body come. and before we can ever receive the son, what happened? "the trumpet of god shall sound; the dead in christ shall rise first (the new body); and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkle of an eye (hallelujah.); and shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air." the secret has been made known; the seals are open; the trumpet sounded for israel; the two prophets is ready to appear. what is it? the church must get off the scene right now so they can appear. he can't deal with two at the same time; he never did. see?oh, brother. watch. exactly, to call all--call them out of the denominations and traditions... now, we see the church of pentecost age is finished. the bride must step out of the way to go up now, so the two servants, the two servants of god, in revelations, the two prophets, can appear upon the scene to sound the seventh trumpet to them, make known to them the christ.the seventh angel messenger say, "behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world." not "behold my methodist, my baptist, my pentecostal"; but the word, the son of god, the lamb of god, that takes away the sin of the world; for no other foundations is there.they'll say, "how long have we got?" the jews are in their homeland; the bride's called. scripturally everything just exactly what he promised; we're ready. the hour is here.nations are breaking; israel's awakening;the signs that the bible foretold;the gentile days numbered,with horrors encumbered,return, o dispersed to your own.the day of redemption is near;man's hearts are failing for fear;be filled with god's spirit,have your lamps trimmed and clear;look up, your redemption is near.false prophets are lying;god's truth they're denying,that jesus, the christ, is our god. (that's right.)but we'll walk where the apostles have trod.for the day of redemption is near;man's hearts are failing for fear;be filled with the spirit,your lamps trimmed and clear; (don't take a chance.)look up, your redemption is near.the prophet said it shall be light in the evening time.it shall be light in the evening time;the path to glory you will surely find;in the water way is the light today,buried in the precious name of jesus.young and old, repent of all your sins;the holy ghost will surely enter in.the evening lights have come;it is a fact that god and christ are one.we're here. we're at the end. that's not just some silly thing of a man; that's thus saith the lord.let us bow our heads. merciful god, jehovah, the almighty that thundered on mount sinai, and the people screamed, "let moses speak and not god, lest we die," you said, great jehovah, "i'll raise them up a prophet; i'll not speak to them no more like this." but you promised what you'd do, and you did it. you raised us up the lord jesus. he is the word; you said he was. "in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god. and the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us."we see the things that he prophesied to us here through his prophet john on the isle of patmos; we see it fulfilled to the letter. we see the holy ghost made manifest among us here on earth. we see the denominations put him out of the church, the word. they got nothing against the people; it's that word that they hate; it's against their tradition, just as when you were here on earth, you was the word, and you were against their tradition; and they threw you out of their churches everywhere.and now, lord, there's no cooperation nowhere. trying even to get into south africa where i know there's some souls there yet waiting. every place, and look like they won't receive me, lord. not because of me, lord; it's because of this message. but you said it would be this way; and you made it known to us, so we wouldn't be discouraged. we know the hour we're living.god, these people set here this morning in this hot, baking room here. they've listened close; they see now, i'm sure. if they don't, reveal it to them, lord, why that you wouldn't permit me to take those trumpets. i see it has nothing to do with us. like that sixth trumpet, it all happened, and we done seen the sixth seal open; and we seen a vision here two weeks ago of the preview of the bride and the church, as i told it here. just as you showed me, lord, i told it. here we are; it may be later than we think.oh, father, if there's a person here this morning that had just taken some superstition, some theological influence, or some theologian's word (which is contrary to the word of god), and they don't know the real christ, the real holy spirit; it isn't revealed to them, the word, yet, how the word is to be in this day; they only see a tradition; they living in a--a light that's blinding. like the greatest robbery that was ever done in the world was in england; it was done by a false light. and the greatest robbery your church has ever had, has been when they taken a denominational light and refused the genuine light of the bible, the christ.oh, god, be merciful. save the lost, lord. please, i ask just a little while longer, jesus. we got loved ones. just a little while longer. soon that great rock will be hewed out of the mountain. grant it, lord. if any is here this morning without you, may they come just now sweetly and receive you.while we have our heads bowed, if you'd raise your hand and say, "remember me, brother branham." we have no... the altars and things are filled up. god bless you. just say, "remember..." god bless you. god bless you. god bless you. just literally hundreds of hands.father god, there's a little shadow somewhere; take it away, lord. they set here in this room. don't... satan might've blinded their eyes in times past, but i pray that you'll wink at that, as you did to us in many days ago. but now, that you call us all to sight... the bible said that they were blind, they didn't know it. said, "i counsel thee to buy of me eyesalve." god, use the salve this morning upon their eyes that they might see. yet it be humble in a bunch of humble people, and humble, uneducated, and so forth, but yet that's the way it was at the beginning. grant it, lord, that they'll receive it just now. i give them to thee, in the name of thy son, jesus.and you said, "he that heareth my word (i'm sure, lord, the best of my knowledge, they heard it.), and believeth on him that sent me (not make-believe, but really believe--believes what the word has said), has everlasting life; and shall not come to the judgment, but's passed from death unto life." john 5:24.grant, lord, that they'll be yours from this hour on. if there's a wonder in their mind, take it away. if there's a sick person in our midst, let the great holy spirit, lord (which i know there is, and revealing the thoughts, standing here on the platform)... they know all about it; i pray that you'll heal them, lord. settle all the questions.the pool will be open to those who've never been immersed in the name of jesus christ, taking the name of the bridegroom. they got a denominational, ecclesiastical... no one was ever baptized in that titles of father, son, holy ghost, or sprinkled, and these traditional things that belongs to churches of this age, antichrist movement, image of the beast. nobody was ever baptized in the name of father, son, holy ghost till the catholic church. all the bible and all the history afterwards says they were baptized in the name of jesus.paul said in galatians 8:1, "if even an angel from heaven comes and preaches another gospel, let him be cursed." and you commanded those people who'd been baptized under john, the same one who baptized jesus, to come and be rebaptized again in the name of jesus christ, in acts 19. he said, "don't even let a angel tell you anything else."there will come a messenger in the last days, will guide the people back to the firstfruits, back to the original faith. grant it, lord, that that great messenger among us now, the great christ, the holy spirit made vivid, made understanding, opening up the word and revealing it to us, may he guide them back to the original pentecostal faith. like peter said on the day of pentecost, "repent, ever one of you; be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin." and it was forever that way, to every person, until the roman church at nicaea.god, be merciful now. the pool will be ready, the hearts open; come in, lord jesus; we're in the last hours; if there is possibility, lord, of them coming in at this hour, which i hope and trust that there is. and we who are in, lord, may we take inventory now, that we have seen and heard the voice of god speaking through his word, and we know what hour we're living. grant it, father. we commit them to thee in the name of thy son. now, with our heads bowed...softly and tenderly jesus is calling,calling for you and for me;see, on the portals he's waiting and...the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride jeffersonville 64-0802 216jeffersonville inv-3 n-5your body was justified under noah's baptism. amen. and your flesh, when it dropped upon there... and the earth is to be cleansed by fire (the place where you live) with the baptism of the holy ghost, a dwelling place for christ and his bride, the new jerusalem. watch this city.earth--take up its abode on earth. now, you can plainly see, as i said, the--this change. the earth must be changed; it cannot have it like this.the church could not go--the world could not go right on after the millennium without being changed. see? to have such a place in it, it'll have to be changed. just like we must be changed by it's holy fire, to condition and make a place for him to be contained within us; that is, the holy ghost.notice now. there'll be plenty of room in the new earth. yeah (see?), plenty of room. it'll be renovated (that's true.) by fire, but there'll be no more sea.notice, the city is fifteen hundred miles square. now, listen real close while we draw these dimensions (i want to erase the blackboard just a moment).here's a deep revelation from god. none of these other... i'll bring the rest of this up, the lord willing.notice, now the earth is... well, you turn over into the book of revelations, you can see how he measured it by the cubits and by the furlongs, twenty-three hundred. so now, we find out that the--the city is measured, fifteen hundred miles square. you know how far that would reach? (i measured it off this week.) it would reach from maine to florida, and from the eastern seaboard to six hundred miles a past--west of the mississippi. in other words, half of the united states, just for the city.you say, "there ain't no room." when the sea's gone there will be, 'cause pretty near four-fifths of it's in water. that right? the explosion dries up the sea, erupts the earth. oh, my, and remember fifteen hundred miles square. what a city. and... but remember the sea is gone. and the breadth and the height are the same. that would make it fifteen hundred miles this way, fifteen hundred miles that way, fifteen hundred miles the length by the breadth by the height. fifteen hundred miles (think of it.) transparent gold. and the city had a wall around it.now, now, that doesn't necessary mean by being equal. it said, "... and the walls and the foundation were equal." that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a cube or square. there is another geographical measure that the dimensions are the same. that is the pyramid. foursquare--lieth foursquare, and the walls were the same. let me draw it. [brother branham illustrates--ed.]see? length, breadth, height. we're going to get into something sure as the world.notice, the dimensions of this angle is exactly the same, all of them. length by the breadth by the height. there's another measure, the pyramid that proves it. this being this a-way would answer exactly enoch's sign in egypt, the pyramid. would it?enoch, before the antediluvian destruction, when justification was coming in, he brought forth a sign. and in this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber. watch, on the seventh step (if you ever studied the dimensions of the pyramid) what comes out to take the oncomer to introduce to the king. watch, whose station that is standing there, and you'll see the day you're living (in the pyramid).now, god made three bibles. now, there's a pyramid teaching that's nonsense, but there's a genuine pyramid. see? notice. now, god's first bible... he made three; they have to be everything in a three. jesus comes three times. he come once to redeem his bride, next time to get his bride, next time with his bride. see?now notice, how beautiful. see? and in this pyramid was seven steps and then the king's chamber. and we're in the seventh church age before the king takes his throne. and remember, the pyramid never did have a capstone on it.god's first bible was in the skies, the zodiac. it starts off and runs every age. the first, beginning of the zodiac is the virgin. that's how he come first. the last figure in the zodiac is leo the lion, the second coming. just before there is the cross fishes, which is the cancer age, that we're living in now.there was a pyramid after that (enoch) which testified exactly (we wouldn't have time to go into it, but someday by god's help i'll show you.), just exactly draws the dimension of the hour we're living. see?notice, but this geographical measure now that we have, whose dimensions are the same, doesn't necessary mean there has to be a--a cube. notice, this would answer egypt--the--enoch's sign in egypt.in the earth's time of purifying by its baptism of fire, there will be volcanics, such as this earth exploding, and will push up a pyramid-like mountain. see? plenty of room to do it; this whole thing will be changed; the whole surface will be changed. you got it? it will push up a pyramid-like mountain. this would exactly be with the word if it does it, which it will.now notice, for in isaiah 65:25 (where we just read) it said, "they shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the lord." oh, "all my holy mountain." remember, it's always a mountain.if the walls were straight up and down, this city could only be seen from the outside--or from the inside. the throne can only be seen from the inside. but notice, it would be seen only from the inside, but now we see the promise of isaiah 4:5. let's just read it.and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion, and upon her assembly, a cloud of smoke by day, and a shining of... fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.oh that city of mount zion,and as a pilgrim, yet i love it still.when i get to those ages...when i reach that city on the hill. (see?)notice, mount sinai was where god descended on top of it, when he spoke to israel in a pillar of fire. he descended on top of a mountain, mount sinai. on the mount of transfiguration, when he declared, "this is my beloved son; hear ye him," he descended in a pillar of light in shining brightness upon top of the mountain before peter, james, and john. and in there he was represented with both moses and elijah, the translated and the dead raised. glory.the new city and the new earth, the new creation, the city on the hill with the throne in the top of it: the throne up here in the top and the dwellers all up and down on this mountain, and the wall that's around this had twelve foundations, and each one of them had the breast--a stone was in aaron, which represented the twelve tribes of israel. and in the gate... they had four gates set just exactly like the temple in the wilderness, like the tent was in the wilderness.notice, each one had--had the apostles, three on each side, twelve apostles. each... and it was one hundred and forty-four cubits high. one hundred and forty-four cubits is exactly two hundred and sixteen feet, making each one of those big stones almost twenty foot tall... the breast plate, in that gate, making up that wall that was around the city.now, it... the city doesn't rest on top of the wall, 'cause a city fifteen hundred miles cannot do that. it's a wall here, that you enter in, like the gates of the old jerusalem. you entered through the wall into that, and each one of these has the twelve foundations. and each one had the emerald, and the different stones which represented the twelve tribes of israel. and there's apostles each... over that big, one, solid pearl gate set a name of an apostle. and didn't jesus said, "you'll set on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of israel"? who set at the gate to judge when they come into the city? oh, my, there you are. the kings of the earth, entering into the city, comes before the apostolic judge, as jesus promised.oh, my. on this throne, on the top of it, fifteen hundred miles high, the whole world will see the light of the world, jesus, setting on the throne on top of the world, top of the church, top of mount zion, which is fifteen hundred miles (half size of the united states) and it raises plumb up till you can see him the world over, fifteen hundred miles high. and all up and down the earth will be the redeemed.there will be the houses of pure gold. there will be avenues, and parks, and gardens, and the river of life coming trickling out from the throne and running down through little chasms and, oh, over the terraces. and the tree of life will be blooming in every yard and bear its fruits twelve times a year, change fruit every month. and the kings of the earth shall come into it and bring their honor... and the leaves are for the healing of the nation. when the kings are living in peace out there, when they go out, they'll pick a tree, a leaf off like that (like the dove come back, that the wrath of god had been settled, and brought the holly leaf into the ark), so when the king leaves by bring his glory into the bride's chamber here into the city, he will hold a leaf to his neighbor king, and we're in peace forevermore. amen. healing of the nations. it's all settled.one time we fought for one another's blood, brother, and we cherished, and hollered, and shot, and burnt children and everything, but now there's peace. the healing, not disease healing, it's all done: healing of the nations. amen.city with the throne in top, revelations 21:23, "and they need no light for the lamb and the lord god is the light thereof." see?the lord god is that pillar of fire that followed the children of israel through the wilderness. and he is ascended upon the throne in that perfect kingdom, when time--the kingdom that jesus is to surrender to the father, that god might be all and in all. jesus sets upon his throne here as our joseph. then the king is that light that will be on top of mount zion, and his holy light will flood the entire city. hallelujah.fifteen hundred miles high and fifteen hundred miles square with the paradises of god built all through that city, streets, avenues... read your revelations 21; see if it isn't right. see? they need no light there for the lamb is the light. and on the throne can be seen setting fifteen hundred miles... it don't run right straight up like this, it slants off like the pyramid. if it'd be half of the distance then, that'd be about... run up like this (you see?) from one city to the other. now, if you will notice... from one side of the city to the other. i could drop a little something here if you want me to.did you notice the little group here? it's just about that part of circumference it covers: (see?) from georgia, california, to saskatchewan, from kansas to the rock-bound coast of maine. that's what's gathered. that's about what's represented right here--about fifteen hundred miles square.oh, they come from the east and west,they come from the land afar;to feast with our king;to dine... (what on? man shall not live by bread alone, by bread--word, that...)to dine as his guests,how blessed these pilgrims are. (in the world, i have to say, "i never seen people like them.')oh, beholding his hallowed face,aglow with light divine;blessed partakers of his grace,as gems in his crown shall shine.oh, jesus is coming soon,our troubles will then be ov'roh, what if our lord,this moment should come...it won't be long. everything's perfectly, geographically: sodom, the messengers, everything setting just exactly right. what does it mean? just think, coming to this one little tabernacle, fifteen hundred miles square, from the same dimensions.why is it god so thought and cared so much about that little place of palestine (see?) when it's just a little spot? but right in there is where the temple will set. that's where the new jerusalem will break up right there. olive... mount of olives shall cleave part to the right and left (sure) when she pushes up from the beneath. now, if they said pushing apart like this... it's pushing up, in that day when he stands, his holy feet upon the mountain...notice, on his throne fifteen hundred miles high... remember, satan tried to tempt him one time on top of a mountain. see? the new city has twelve foundations (as we went through it): twelve patriarchs, a hundred and forty-four cubits being the breastplate of aaron, twelve gates of pearl, twelve disciples' names. jesus stand the headstone on the throne, when his saints has crowned him the king of kings, the lord of lords, and he's the headstone.i don't have my pocketbook with me, but if you'll notice in your pocketbook if you have a one dollar bill, they have the seal of the united states, the eagle on one end, a-holding the spears, the coat of arms, as it were. and on the other end, it's got the pyramid with the all-seeing eye on top of it. see, they didn't know what they were doing. and on there it's wrote in latin, and you'll find out it says, "it..." this is the great seal. they didn't know what they were doing. neither did caiaphas know he was prophesying. there's the great seal. here it is. see? the city, it's not just a flat cube like this (see?), but it leans up so it can be seen. and upon this holy mountain of the lord, the lord shall descend upon top of his mountain. here he is. that's the reason the capstone wasn't put on by enoch. see? that's the reason the capstone has to come now. and the mountain will be pushed up and it'll be the mount of the lord and in here will dwell the redeemed.these avenues, and big freeways, as it was, parks, and the river of life will flow, run right through it. and every house will be made of transparent gold, and the streets will be made of gold, and the trees of life will be there and will bear twelve manners of fruit. and the kings and the honored men of the earth shall bring their honor and glory into the gates, and the gates shall not be shut by night, because there is no night there.in that city where the lamb is the light;in that city where there cometh no night;i've a mansion over there,that's free from toil and care,oh, i'm going where that lamb is the light.don't you see that the towns, the cities, the houses, the dwellings, are--are speaking of that right now. all these natural things are a shadow. take a shadow at a distance, like my hand. before there could be a--a positive or a negative, there has to be a positive. and you see that shadow, look like i got a dozen fingers, but then when you go to getting it close together, it--it focuses down to one, and then the shadow fades into the hand. that's a lot of times people thinks there's three or four gods. you're looking too far back in the early reformation. see? come on down now and you find focuses in till there's one. it's exactly.there's one bride, not a dozen denominations, but one bride; that's the elected out of every--out of the--out of the earth, that's been predestinated to this, the ones who can recognize their place in the kingdom.on this throne, look so high, the new city with its foundations, twelve gates, jesus the headstone, the apostles judging the twelve tribes... the pyramid of enoch casts no shadow no time of the day. i've been in egypt at the pyramids. it's so geographically fixed, and in the dimensions of this great geometrical figure; that no matter where the sun is, there's never a shadow around the pyramid. see how it is? and there'll never be no night there. him on top of the mountain floods it with his glory. his glory-light will be there all the time. there'll be no night there. jesus the headstone.now notice, so the redeemed shall walk in the light. we sing now: "we'll walk in the light, that beautiful light..." there's something in us calling out, "passed from death unto life." it's because that's waiting. see? that's what's the attribute, what we feel.truly, this is (are you ready?)--this is the city that abraham was looking for. see? being a prophet he knowed that city was somewhere; the bible said so. and he forsook the city he lived, and he went over--and look where he went. exactly where it will be. see? he was looking for a city whose builder and maker was god, (see?) being a prophet.jesus gone to prepare with divine hands, a divine city, divine architect, for a divine boughten people, for a predestinated people. he's gone to prepare...abraham was looking for it, and he professed that he was a pilgrim and a stranger, for he looked for a city whose builder and maker was god; that prophet knowing it was somewhere. john saw it coming down, but abraham thought it must be on earth right then. why? he met melchizedek, the king of it and gave him a tithe, which had no father, or no mother. he had no beginning of life or no ending of life. abraham met him, and they took communion (amen.) right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up, the holy mountain of the lord where the redeemed will live.oh, my. that time just don't stop. no, we're in time... after while we will go to eternity.oh, holy mountain... there will be streets of transparent gold, avenues, and houses, and parks. (if you want to read this: revelations 21:18.) the tree of life will be there, twelve different manners of fruit; one each month will be bore on it. the people will eat these fruits; they'll change their diet every--every month, and it's from--for only the overcomers. do you know that? it isn't for the denominations. you say, "you mean that, brother branham?" let's turn to revelations 2, just a minute and find it, revelations 2:7. let's find out now whether it's really the truth or not. revelations 2:7 reads like this:and... he that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit... (now remember, he's not talking to the jews now; this is the church, the gentiles.)... he that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the churches; to him that overcometh, i will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of god.overcomers only, that overcome the beast, overcome his mark (that's catholicism, protestantism, denominationalism.)--who overcome the beast, his mark, the letter of his name; he will have a right to the tree of life, to enter into the gates, where nothing that defiles can ever go in. see? think of it.now, just a minute now as we go just a little bit farther. tree of life will be for the overcomers only.the leaves will be for the healing of the nations, that is the kings that live in there, bringing their honor in. when they bring their honor in and lay it before the throne of god (just like the outside, the ten--the eleven tribes brought in, every one of them, a tenth to levi... see?), when they bring their honor into the--from the blessed land and that, they'll reach from the tree of life, break off a holly leaf--or tree of life leaf, and they'll walk out together. there's no more war; everything's at peace. the leaves are a memorial for the healings of the nation.the same tree... not like adam, he... there was a tree of life in the garden of eden that he might've eaten from, if he hadn't have fell. that tree of life reminded him all the time that his new--his youth was continually going on. see? same will the nations. the leaves will be for the healing of the nations. notice, not the sickness now, he'd have the same rights that adam did, like the dove with the holly leaf, it's all... each king taken a leaf.notice, the river of life, perhaps many little streams making it up. now, in this earth... (i'm going to close just in a few minutes.)where are we friends? where are we? just waiting now to get out of the way so revelations 11 can be made to--known to the jews. that's right, the rapture coming.the end
