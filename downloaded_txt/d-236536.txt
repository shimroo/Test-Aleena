amsterdam – where to eat cheaply 

you get what you pay for when it comes to food in the netherlands, where most ingredients are imported or grown at fairly high cost in greenhouses. so unless you have a strong affinity for bitterballs —
                                                fried meatballs that are the buffalo wings of the netherlands — you can’t avoid spending a fairly substantial amount for decent meals. fortunately, the intimate and cozy balthazar’s
                                                keuken (elandsgracht 108; 31-20-420-2114), while considered one of amsterdam’s top restaurants, is also one of the most affordable, serving up a three-course prix-fixe meal at 24.50 euros. a typical
                                                menu might start with an assortment of five hot and cold appetizers like wild spinach croquettes or cinnamon crostini with spicy beet root, followed with a choice of a meat or a fish main dish like a bouillabaisse
                                                with saffron, fennel and red onions and end with a dessert of espresso mascarpone with prunes poached in sherry. a bottle of house wine is 15 euros. — gisela williams

athens – best things to do free 

summer arrives with a frenzy of free events in athens. opera divas sing at the ancient agora, crowds clamber up the parthenon for midsummer strolls and dancers prance amid ancient ruins until 3 a.m. check www.cultureguide.gr
                                                or english-language newspapers like kathimerini for a listing of these events — which only take place on nights when there is a full moon. if your travel dates don’t coincide with the phases
                                                of the moon, then venture to lycabettus hill, the tallest spot in athens, for a rewarding view of the city. no need to tote binoculars up the craggy 968-foot rock. they’re available at an observation

athens – best money-saving tip 

don’t fall prey to money-gouging taxi drivers. opt instead for a 10-euro transit pass that offers unlimited use of all forms of public transportation for up to a week. the pass can be bought at the syntagma
                                                metro station, a gleaming minimuseum worth visiting even if you decide to give public transportation a pass. — anthee carassava

barcelona – where to eat cheaply 

tapas would be an easy choice here — especially in the raval neighborhood behind the appetite-whetting boquería market, where the stalls heave with produce and succulent cured meats and cheeses.
                                                you can put together a meal for two for less than 10 euros, $12.40, at 1.24 euros to the dollar. at midday, strap on the feedbag. most restaurants offer specially priced lunch menus with two or three hearty
                                                courses often costing less than 10 euros, including a glass of wine and coffee or dessert. and even in the trendiest establishments, the waiter will almost never bring the check until you ask for it, so
                                                sip slowly and soak up the sun and atmosphere beachfront at the carpe diem lounge club (passeig maritim 32; 34-93-224-0470; www.cdlcbarcelona.com). for a break from traditional spanish fare, try the new-school
                                                camper foodball (elisabets 9; www.foodball.com), where everything is not only free — of pesticides and genetic manipulation, that is — but also certified organic and rolled up into appetizing
                                                and easy-to-handle round balls to be eaten with the hands and washed down with fresh juices or hemp beer for less than 10 euros. — andrew ferren

barcelona – lodging for under 100 euros 

barcelona was the birthplace of boutique hotels in spain, most of which have sprung to life well into the 200-to-300-euro territory. the hotel banys orientals (argentaria 37; 34-93-268- 8460; www.hotelbanysorientals.com)
                                                remains a bargain at 95 euros a night for a double room. it is in the heart of the fancier-by-the-minute born district, and the rooms are modern and casual with dark-wood tester beds, chunky parsons tables,
                                                and lots of white paint and crisp linens. the hotel restaurant, sr. parellada, could also easily top the list of the best values in town. — andrew ferren

barcelona – best deal on a cultural event 

between the street festivals, strolling balladeers, and impromptu drunken songfests, your next concert may be just around the next corner. but for music in more luxe surroundings, the city’s famous opera
                                                house, the liceu (la rambla 51-59; 34-93-485-9900; www.liceubarcelona.com), has thoughtfully added a junior varsity to its all-star lineup. in productions that are otherwise identical, the “popular
                                                cast,” as these excellent but nonfamous performers are known, stand in for the divas and divos, who get the night off. tickets are at least 50 percent cheaper for these performances, with orchestra
                                                seats for “madama butterfly” this june selling for 47.50 euros instead of the usual 115.75. — andrew ferren

look around. so much of the city’s charm and rhythm comes from doing nothing beyond taking in its rich history and endless capacity for rejuvenation, like the architectural marvel of the medieval palaces
                                                that now house a picasso museum on calle montcada or a once fetid harbor that has been resuscitated into barcelona’s typically stylish riff of the riviera. even gaudí’s park guell used

buy a two-to-five-day barcelona card (23 to 34 euros) online (www.barcelonaturisme.com) and get a 10-percent discount on the card, which grants free or discounted entry to many museums and attractions, and,
