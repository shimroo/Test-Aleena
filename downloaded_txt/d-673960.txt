your guide to fly fishing 



about spokane fly fishers 



the spokane fly fishers club was founded in 1977 through the efforts of larry patterson, lee gomes, don and mary deluca, and joe king. these dedicated anglers sought to develop a family-friendly club to promote the sport of fly fishing through education, application, and conservation.the club meets monthly (sept. – may) to discuss all aspects of the sport and to encourage novice and advanced anglers alike to get involved. the club’s annual fly fishing school and other classes teach the techniques and traditions of fly fishing as well as active participation in conserving quality fishing and waters.the spokane fly fishers club is an affiliated club of fly fishers international.

the waters beckon 



the spokane fly fishers club works hard to provide its members with a very rich and rewarding diet of events designed to enrich and develop fly fishing skills and provide opportunities to use those skills on the rivers and lakes of the northwest. we allow all members of the club and their families to experience not only the fishing experience, but also participate in conservation of our lakes and streams, and learn about the special fish that we are so lucky to have in our region.
