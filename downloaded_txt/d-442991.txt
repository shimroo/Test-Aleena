john’s island set the standard years ago. for us it still remains the one lifestyle community by which every other one is measured. – dave m.

welcome to john’s island. a cherished haven enjoyed by generations who have discovered the undeniable allure of life by the sea.   established in 1969, this luxurious, ocean-to-river, 1,650-acre gated club community just north of vero beach, florida is one of the finest residential clubs in the nation with a spectacular master plan limiting development to 1,382 residential properties or one unit per acre. easily accessible, getting to john's island has never been easier! 

designated as one of the top 100 platinum clubs of america, fortune 500 ceo’s and entrepreneurs alike are attracted to the picturesque seaside landscape, world-class amenities, no state income tax, near-perfect climate, legendary family-oriented lifestyle and outstanding calendar of social and recreational activities. the john's island club membership is by invitation only and subject to approval by the board of directors.
since 1969, we exclusively specialize in john’s island. as market leaders, our highly experienced sales associates are experts in all aspects of john’s island, and live here year-round. conveniently located just inside the main gate, we invest 100% of our time and resources on john's island properties and the john's island community. broker/owner, bob gibb, is a driving force behind many of the successful charity agencies in the county.
