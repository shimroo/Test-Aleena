‚Äã‚Äãmy name is kareem rosser, and i am a graduate of the work to ride program. i grew up in west philadelphia, in a neighborhood known as ‚Äúthe bottom‚Äù, where going to jail or getting shot is just as likely for young men as high school graduation.¬† one day while riding bicycles in fairmount park, my older brothers stumbled upon a run-down barn with horses. that day they met work to ride‚Äôs founder, lezlie hiner, who had spotted the boys and told them if they stayed in school, she would teach them how to ride. when i found out where my brothers had been going after school, i begged them to take me along! it was 2000 and i was 8 years old when i joined the work to ride program.
in 2011, i captained the work to ride polo team, which was the first-ever all african american team to win the national interscholastic polo championship. in 2015, i led my colorado state university polo team to the national intercollegiate polo championship and was named the intercollegiate polo player of the year. in 2016, i graduated from colorado state university with a degree in economics.
through work to ride, i was provided with educational and equestrian opportunities i would not have had otherwise as a kid growing up in west philadelphia. today, i reside in philadelphia and work in finance. i currently serve on the executive committee of work to ride‚Äôs board of directors. my hope is to expand the program so it allows more at-risk youth the opportunities that i was given.
