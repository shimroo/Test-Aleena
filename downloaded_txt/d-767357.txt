                    our services                

our extensive continuum of service offerings run the gamut of community mental health solutions. wherever children, youth, and families in the community need help, we work diligently to meet them where they are with the services they need to make positive change, from behavioral health therapy to youth and family counseling. our programs are created with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, and fall into three categories: mental health, education, and child welfare.

                                same day access                            

for children, youth, and families with challenges that require immediate attention, we offer same day access to our counseling services. the process is quick and easy, and offers a necessary lifeline on short notice.

                                mental health                            

through utilization of in-home counseling and outpatient treatment centers, we provide options and convenience for families in need of mental health services. we also have an inpatient facility with a huge number of amenities for children and youth who would be best supported by on site support and treatment. we also offer a variety of psychiatric services.

                                education                            

our school based mental health team works in over 15 schools throughout central ohio, offering counseling services to children and youth and support to caregivers and educators in their home school. in addition, we run the bonner academy, a non-public charter school that serves as a day treatment program for children and youth who might otherwise have difficulty in a traditional school setting.

                                child welfare                            

at the buckeye ranch, we maintain an extensive foster care network, placing hundreds of children with families throughout nearly half of the counties in ohio. in addition to foster care, we also offer transitional housing for young people who are ready to leave foster care but not yet ready to go out on their own, as well as the permanent family solutions network, which makes referrals to help families deal with concerning behavior in young people.

                                our work                            

we are committed to offering treatment approaches that work for all families. our focus is on proven, evidence-based treatments that can be reliably applied to children, youth, and families facing a variety of challenges. we place a particular importance on trauma informed care, which emphasizes the role of childhood trauma in difficulties that develop later, and works to incorporate the neurosequential model of therapeutics (nmt) devised by dr. bruce d. perry.
