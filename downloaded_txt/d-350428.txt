tradition of quality - a 
              history of service 
 u.s. stoneware 
              was founded in 1865 and manufactures its products in a 70,000 sq. 
              ft. facility located just south of youngstown, ohio. early in its 
              history, u.s. stoneware developed an expertise in formulating ceramic 
              materials with superior wear resistance to meet the requirements 
              of various process industries. today we manufacture ceramic ball 
              mills, jar rolling mills, milling jars, grinding media, drum tumblers 
              and rollers and a host of additional equipment to meet our customers 
              milling, grinding and blending needs.
