important disclaimers:
these presentations may have unexplained omissions; they still should be
helpful to the intended audience.  these presentations do not establish date of
writing or publication; that is a matter for archival bibliographies of my
works.  the research continues; and recent results allow some of these
presentations to be appreciably strengthened.  they are posted here without the
updates in the interests of quick availability.  we have chosen html and have
chosen to insert word equivalents for characters not in plain-text.
