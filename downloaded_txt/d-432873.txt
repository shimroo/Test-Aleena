	 john sterling’s a rare gem, don’cha know?–mike dimauro, the day (eastern connecticut),10/10/2011
	 
    

“what, the yankees should go out and hire someone who hates them? or is more boring than geometry?...let me just say this: i don’t care whether you like him. i like him. and suzyn waldman, too….it’s ok to enhance the product with some personality, you know…it’s baseball. not “meet the press.”…10/10/2011
10/10/2011, “sterling’s a rare gem, don’cha know?” the day (eastern connecticut), mike dimauro, the day assistant sports editor




“want to know the hard part? it wasn’t losing. [yankees had just lost 2011 alds to detroit tigers]
 showbiz, as john sterling likes to say. besides, when you witness your 
chest-thumping rival’s epic (quite epic, actually) collapse during a 
pennant race, a loss in the playoffs is a duller ache.
it’s just not particularly comforting at the moment to think about yankee baseball next summer without sterling. [“randy levine, the president of the yankees, who is currently negotiating a new team radio contract with several outlets, would not comment on sterling’s future but called him ‘a unique character and a real asset.’]
let me just say this: i don’t care whether you like him. i like him. 
and suzyn waldman, too.
so do millions of yankee fans, otherwise known as the target audience. sterling and waldman are part of
every day from april through october, eccentric, eclectic, entertaining and everywhere the season takes us.
it was this line, though, in a recent feature in the new york times about sterling- writer bill pennington [“a new england native”] captured sterling brilliantly –
 that has me worried:
“randy levine, the president of the yankees, who is currently negotiating a new team radio contract with several outlets, would not comment on sterling’s future but called him ‘a unique character and a real asset.‘ the team has the right to approve all announcers chosen by its radio partner.”
a real asset? what is he, inventory? gee, randy. don’t, you know, blow out your thesaurus or anything finding the right words
for a guy who has been part of every yankee game for the last 23 years [as of 2011].
sterling is like your favorite movie. you know the lines are coming. you know the inflection.
but you just can’t wait to hear them again.
it’s not just “robbie cano, don’cha know.” 
it’s not just “you can’t predict baseball” or
 a rant about the rain. it’s theater. like the way he introduces the 
engineer for the radio broadcasts: carlos silva. sterling pronounces it 
“seal-vah.”
here’s how it goes: i’m in the car. it’s 6:30.
 cue the yankee jingle. “live from yankee stadium in the bronx, it’s new
 … york … yankees … baseball! and tonight, on a cold, damp, dreary, 
horrible night, it’s the first game of a three-game series between the 
yankees and the baltimore orioles.
“along with our producer engineer carlos seal-vah …”
and i giggle.
without fail.
and that’s the point. i giggle. so do all the other yankee fans, 
otherwise known as the target audience. it’s entertainment. and sterling not only gets it, he delivers it.
it’s baseball. not “meet the press.” baseball. the toy department. entertainment.
this is something that flies over the head, 
quite majestically, of sterling’s critics.
pennington reported that sterling “has spawned more than 100 web sites dedicated to denigrating his emblematic calls and his anomalous broadcasting style.”
let me guess: those people gave up their careers teaching at yale and need to pass the time.
then there’s phil mushnick, a newspaper columnist at the new york post, whose repertoire has shrunk to killing sterling, mike francesa and espn. (rinse. repeat).
the times [10/1/2011, “voice of yankees draws high ratings and many critics,” ny times, bill pennington] reported that mushnick “has written more than 270 articles about sterling,” calling him a “narcissistic, condescending blowhard.”
then the best quote of all:
“yankees fans who like him
are people who just want someone to root for the team,” 
mushnick said.
what, the yankees should go out and hire someone who hates them? 
or is more boring than geometry?
and it’s not like sterling and waldman never criticize the yankees. they do it often. (just wait till they fail to advance a runner).
and send up smoke signals the next time you hear criticism of the home team on the shaw’s/weei red sox radio network, a carnival of nightly cheerleading (and
 yankee game updates). seriously. the only place you hear more nicknames
 is in a frat house: youk, petey, gonzo, pap, scoot, els, salty and tek.
it’s ok to enhance the product with some personality, you know. john sterling makes you listen because of what’s coming. and what’s not.
like one night this summer [2011]. we’re on vacation in ocean city, n.j., sipping some euphoric nectar on the porch listening to the ballgame. sterling is apoplectic that home plate umpire jerry layne is taking too long to call balls and strikes. 
suddenly, he breaks into song:
“everybody’s hand in hand … waitin’ for jerry layne.”
it’s a takeoff on an old sinatra lyric (“everybody’s hand in hand, swingin’ down the lane.”)
i’m sorry. but that’s perfect, brilliant
and the essence of john sterling.
and i want him back for as long as he wants to do it.
i believe i speak for yankees universe on this.
and in this case, we should be the only ones who count.”
………………………………
“this is the opinion of mike dimauro.”

	 craig carton tapped to do play by play for 3 games in yankee radio booth, august 10-11, 2024. decision on full time sterling replacement to be made in off season
	 
    

a decision on sterling’s full time replacement will be made in the off season. hearing craig carton doing play by play in the yankee radio booth on saturday, aug. 10, 2024 must mean someone realized that “doing play by play in the minors”
 is irrelevant to having any job in the two-person yankee radio booth. 
in the case of choosing john sterling’s replacement for play by play, 
the person needs to be a natural talker, preferably someone who’s already succeeded in talk radio,
 who’s thus going to be at ease participating in give and take in the 
booth with analyst suzyn waldman. further, he isn’t going to have a 
fake, “chirpy” delivery during play by play as others do in an attempt 
to compensate for the fact that they have no personality and no 
confidence. with the exception of craig carton and rickie ricardo,
 none of the others trying out for sterling’s replacement belong on 
radio at all. craig sounds perfect w. suzyn. what isn’t known is how much they’d be willing to pay carton and what other job prospects he may have.
…………………………………….
added: decision on full time sterling replacement to be made in off season:
7/15/24, “wfan taps craig carton to call 3 yankees games in august alongside suzyn waldman,” the athletic, nytimes.com
“a new but familiar voice will soon rejoin wfan — and in a way he hasn’t been heard before.
the station will tap craig carton to work alongside suzyn waldman on three new york yankees broadcasts next month, carton announced on the station monday alongside hosts evan roberts and tiki barber.
he’ll be on during the series at home against the texas rangers from aug. 9 – 11. carton said that the yankees had called him directly about the gig.
“it’s a great honor,” he said. “it’s a great privilege.”

carton left wfan last summer to focus on his morning talk show with fox sports 1.
carton said he won’t be over the top.
“i want to be clear about that,” he said. “i’m not going to do 
something that’s clownish. i got to leave the crazy home run calls to 
the memory of john and his greatness of all of the years. but i’ll do my
 best. i’ll make sure that it’s unmistakably me and it’s just awesome.”
he added that he hopes he brings the yankees a bit of luck. the team 
has struggled of late, going 8-18 over its last 26 games. it lost its 
final game of the first half sunday in brutal fashion, getting walked off by the baltimore orioles after
 committing a pair of errors. still, the yankees are just a game behind 
the o’s for first place in the american league east.
“all they really need is a little positive juju,” carton said. “like a good luck charm, if you will. the (new york) mets had
 the rally pimp in april. they had grimace in june. they had some fat 
guy dancing to abba, i think, now. that has worked for them.”
a week ago, the new york state broadcasters association announced that carton would be inducted into its hall of fame this year. waldman has been working with a rotation of play-by-players since
 john sterling retired in april. sterling had been calling yankees games
 for 36 years. he had paired with waldman for 20 seasons.
as for whether carton would ever consider being the yankees’ radio play-by-play man full-time, it didn’t sound like much of an option.
“there’s got to be a lot of zeros in that check,” he said.
carton added he’s not sure exactly how far he’ll go if he feels the need to criticize the team while calling the games.
“here’s the real question,” he said. “at some point, if you see something like giancarlo stanton walking to second base, you might have to be critical. i’m wondering, does my phone ring on the way home from the yankees?”
since sterling’s retirement,
 waldman has worked games with justin shackil, emmanuel berbari, rickie 
ricardo and brendan burke. the expectation is that wfan will use the 
rest of the season to try out different play-by-players and
make their decision on a full-time replacement in the offseason.
“i am a very blessed human being,” sterling said in a statement at the time.
 “i have been able to do what i wanted, broadcasting for 64 years. as a 
little boy growing up in new york as a yankees fan, i was able to 
broadcast the yankees for 36 years. it’s all to my benefit, and i leave 
very, very happy. i look forward to seeing everyone again on saturday.””..........................................added: for yankee radio booth fans only, written in oct. 2011:oct. 15, 2011, "john sterling, suzyn waldman, and the yankee radio booth," by susanjohn sterling has called every yankee post season game from 1995 to the present along with 162 regular  season games from 1989. he has seen most if not every pitch thrown in  regular and post season for 23 years. a recent ny times article quotes  michael kay saying sterling does 162 games a year and that seems like a lot to kay who does about 125.
 while stating he's done about 3800 games the article doesn't make clear
 that sterling has done 156 post season  games. no one else has done 
that. tv doesn't do that.
yankee radio and its voices have provided continuity for fans 
through entire seasons, sterling since 1989 and through post seasons 
starting in 1995 and sterling and waldman since 2005.unhappy with yankee stadium attendance in the mid and late 1990's yankee ownership said "nobody would come to the bronx," and wanted to move the stadium to manhattan (parag. 6) (cit. #4). suzyn waldman remembers this, because she's been covering the yankees since the late 1980's first as a radio beat reporter, later as an analyst, and since the mid '90's on television in varous capacities, and has been sterling's partner on radio since 2005. in 1996 the yankees were 7th in al attendance. in 1998 they ranked 8th in attendance through august (parag. 18). they didn't get to #1 in al attendance until 2003. these
  facts don't usually come up in conversation and don't fit the 
narrative  that the yankees always have more attendance, more money, and
 are just  luckier. as a fan it's preferable to listen to someone who 
has  experienced all this and who will fill in important details others 
may  leave out.
alternatives include those who would define the team as bud  selig has prescribed since 1996 (cit. #2 at end of this post). or someone "more boring than geometry."21
 of those 156 post season games went into extra innings. sterling did  
share play by play with partners until   he began doing all innings in  
2005 but he called the majority and likely was watching most of the  
rest. now that the yankees are successful and have a somewhat porous front office with out of town owners (context below, citation
 7), the yankee radio booth is prime for exploitation. whether by a  
celebrity-seeker or for what some perceive as the pot of gold, the  
glittering financial opportunities of shaping public opinion.columnist mike dimauro on the times john sterling article:"then the best quote of all: "yankees fans who like him are people who just want someone to root for the team," (phil) mushnick said.  what, the yankees should go out and hire someone who hates them? 
or is more boring than geometry?
and   it's not like sterling and waldman never criticize 
the   yankees. they   do it often. (just wait till they fail to advance a
   runner)....  it's ok to enhance the product with some personality, you know.
john sterling makes you listen because of what's coming. and what's not."...as if being a yankee fan is controversial or worse, the times quotes a fan saying some people think the team should have a 'network level' play by play
  announcer--implying someone who wasn't a yankee fan. (so it doesn't  
matter what you give yankee fans they'll always be there, besides we  
want a bud selig/espn robot in there who'll talk up what a great idea it
  would be to let the best yankee pitchers all go and pitch in the next 
 world baseball classic because it would show the yankees are  
'unselfish'--might be the thought process). the article does state  
sterling freely rips the team when they do something wrong just like the
  average fan. the word 'homer' doesn't remotely apply to sterling if it means only saying good things.
'not  being a yankee fan' means something different than not being a fan of most other teams. there is  often deep bitterness whether conscious or not. perhaps due in part to 24/7 anti yankee negativity
  (parag. 3). the yankee fan experience, images of its players and the  
like are easy to destroy because a lot of people want to and no one is 
really looking out for them. attack squads
 are usually at the ready to diminish the yankee fan experience. no one 
tries to stop them when they get on a roll-not even in the interest of common decency.
 apparently lead to believe they don't deserve to be a fan as much as 
anyone else, some fans retreat at such times, passively thinking oh 
well, it's part of the territory with the yankees.
it isn't like this with other markets and teams but it is in ny and nationally with the yankees.one ny tabloid whose owner made his fortune via his company boston properties has shown a fixation with roger clemens. perhaps some people will never get over clemens. the publisher adores dictator fidel castro, and both are baseball fans.
  this person has been allowed to insert one of his employees inside the
  yankee radio booth during play by play every 5th inning for several  
years. it's a paid sponsorship capitalizing on the yankee name and the  
implied endorsement of john, suzyn, and the yankees to advance the  
advertiser's particular baseball agenda. the goal of any advertiser in 
any medium is to sell something, to influence public opinion. no  amount
 of money makes this an editorially sound idea for the yankees.  i've 
never heard a booth guest who could provide more than suzyn's  peerless 
reporting though she and john are generous and welcoming to  'guests' 
and create an environment in which the guest can appear to be  adding 
something. the main individual selected by the tabloid owner to  
represent him in the yankee radio booth the past few years is not a yankee fan.
  this was not news to me having seen this person's version of events  
when he was on bud selig's copywriting staff at mlb.com a few years ago.
 that  this individual given a half inning
  inside the yankee radio booth about 5 days out of seven is not a 
yankee  fan was great news to a professional yankee hater. as the yankee
 hater  said, "after all, if you ain’t with ‘em, you’re usually against ‘em!"
the  fan experience of the yankee radio booth is on hold until 
the tabloid  reporter leaves. suzyn and john are such pros at smoothing 
things over a  casual listener might not realize something unpleasant 
and even  disrespectful just happened.i trust both suzyn and john to give the good and the bad
  but always from a perspective of someone who cares about the team. not
  someone who's trying to be smarter or make a name for themselves or 
get  on espn. being 'a homer' to ny credentialed media  doesn't mean voting for a yankee in post season awards. it can mean helping the yankee front office to smear favorite players in
  the media. yankee suits can certainly request radio broadcasters cover
 player issues one way or another. why wouldn't they since it's  well 
known they do it in other media? i haven't heard suzyn or john say  
they've been told to say one thing or another of course. neither would 
do that.  as a listener with particular interest on this topic, i've 
heard a few  instances that sounded influenced from outside the  radio 
booth. there is one person most likely to be giving editorial  orders to
 yankee radio and if you're reading this you  probably know who it is. 
the few instances i refer to were 'high value' issues. once or  twice 
i've had to turn the radio off for awhile after one of these  events.
widespread bias against the yankees or anyone is stealing. 
stealing from  players, the team, their life work and lastly it steals 
from fans.  others can have a fan experience but yankee fans can't,
 is the idea. i  need to know the voices in the radio booth know what we
 as fans are up  against everywhere in the outside world. john and suzyn
 have been the  antidote. they have endless knowledge and they know the 
big picture and i hope they both stay as long as they wish.  what is 
waiting to replace the gracious environment they have created  are 
shrill, formulaic bores. sterling is a natural talker which is one  of 
the reasons he's good at play by play. many of those i hear doing  play 
by play are not natural talkers or great personalities. they rely  on 
formulas to get them through. the ear splitting high decibel chirpy,  
sing-song affectation is common, for example with mets radio guys.  the 
technique is to end a phrase on a low register, then pick up the  next 
phrase 2 or 3 octaves higher, splitting the average ear drum.
this is a violation of the first law of radio, which is that 
it's a one to one medium, one person talking to one other person. or 
allowing us to listen in on a one on one conversation.with 
many of today's baseball radio talkers it's sounds more like a puppet 
show. perhaps it's intended to make the game sound more exciting. espn's
 dan  shulman uses another device, an affectation of the voice rising, 
rising  in crescendo to thunderous level at inappropriate times. i'm 
thinking  he's about to tell me something big and it ends up being 
nothing, like a  routine catch of a ball in the outfield and a normal 
throw to first base with no  big effect either way on the game.
one team's  booth has a schtick where they try not to allow a second to 
 go by  without the other guy filling it up with unnecessary words. fans
 thereby  aren't allowed moments to hear the stadium presence. this 
shows a lack of confidence in an announcer's ability to do spontaneous 
give and take in a booth. john and suzyn aren't like that, they  talk in
 normal, conversational tones (with the occasional exception of a  home 
run call which other guys do as well but none with famous tags  attached
 to players that become known around the world, 'don't-cha know.')  sterling's voice allows one to relax and enjoy the game.
joe castiglione is  one of few others out there who seems like a
 natural talker where you're  not always worried he's going to trip over
 himself.as noted  in the ny times article,
  sterling has never missed a game. i was quite surprised to learn from 
 the article that he only makes $375,000+ in salary. i would have 
thought  around $1 million. regarding phil mushnick's remarks about him i
 see no  reality whatsoever. as far as occasional mistakes, i've 
listened to  other guys and they all make them.  in sterling's case, 
waldman usually  corrects what needs to be corrected and she does it 
graciously.
the yankee tv side, the yes network, is like a junior espn.it's run by a conglomeration of interests with the yankees owning a reported 35%. the majority is owned by goldman sachs and hedge fund people who it's said "want a partnership with the yankees about how the games are  broadcast.'' for
   years yes network yankee studio shows (pre and post game) have  
promoted  a non-yankee player who is also a bud selig and espn favorite.
 yes promoted the non-yankee player's record  for a regular season stat 
when they mentioned mariano rivera's name  which certainly helped the image of the non-yankee player. the same player received similar free promotion on yankee radio this year.
i hope both john and suzyn remain on yankee radio as long as 
they want. if something different happens, i probably won't be 
listening.

citation 1, ny times article on sterling, 10/1/1110/1/11, "voice of yankees draws high ratings and many critics," ny times, bill pennington
(162 reg. season games x 23 years is 3726.  plus 156 post season is a total of 3882.)---------------------
citation 2, a total of 4 items on spreading a culture of negativity around the yankees: two items from joel sherman, first from his 2006 book on the 1996 yankees, second from one of his ny post articles; followed by an item from mlb network 7/31/10, followed by a bud selig statement on wfan, 10/5/06
joel  sherman finds the commissioner's office to be the source  of much anti  yankee negativity.  from his 2006 book about the 1996  yankees, "birth of a  dynasty," p. 311:
"unfortunately for the legacy of this group, the success of these yankees (1996 team) coincided with  a powerful push by central baseball  to   convince fans
  that the disparity between the financial "haves" and    "have-nots" 
was  destroying the competitive balance of the sport. the    yankees 
came to  embody the big-market superpowers. they were demonized    for buying championships. they  were cast as villains by a commissioner's office
    that saw the  advantages of portraying them as a prop in a strategy 
 to   win salary  concessions from the players in collective bargaining,  thus the yankees of this era do not receive near the amount of credit they deserve for what they accomplished."... page 311 from joel sherman in his 2006 book, "birth of a dynasty," about the 1996 yankees.
  the   yankee organization has failed to address this problem as  
baseball   media has become even more centralized under bud selig. it  
wouldn't take much effort and it could make a big difference. negativity
  is used because it works. on the other hand, it seems 'the yankees'  
(whoever that is) view the media as a tool to smear their own players.
second from the ny post on negativity, parag. 3:from joel sherman's column, 9/21/07: "as a rival executive (of the yankees) said recently, “...it  is staggering the amount of negative   noise that comes in new york (from  media and fans)
  when your team   spends that much money, has their  expectations and  
has their history.   it is bad anywhere, but in new york  it is so much 
 louder and so much   more relentless. to stay the course, to  stay  
yourself, i really admire   that.”"from joel sherman's ny post column, 9/21/07, "steadiness and sturdiness"

gerald cardinale, managing director of goldman sachs and yes network board member:  ''it's a bit of a sideshow if the yankees stay in or out, if they do or  don't sell,'' (gerald) cardinale said. any new financial partners, he added,  ''will want a partnership with the yankees about how the games are  broadcast.''  
10/20/08, "yankees, cowboys, and goldman form sports services company" reuters8/2/2007, "goldman sachs would consider yes network sale for right offer," ap, usa today
"the yankees formed yes in 2001 and launched the network the following  year. yankee global enterprises, the team's parent company, owns about  35 percent of the network, with the remainder controlled by goldman and  providence equity partners, and an investment group headed by former new  jersey nets owner ray chambers."---------------------------
#6, suzyn waldman citations7/16/10, "yankees radio announcer suzyn waldman cultivated unique relationship with owner george steinbrenner," bob raissman, ny daily news
"right from the late 1980s when she landed in the world according to george m. steinbrenner. "i like my women to spend my money and look real pretty,"  steinbrenner bellowed during their first face-to-face meeting in 1988.  "i don't like them to be pilots, policemen or sports reporters." waldman had traveled to tampa on her own dime to interview the yankees'  principal owner. in a letter, she convinced him she was worthy.waldman
  wrote that her 5:05 p.m. wfan "yankees report" was heard by  more 
people  than those who read all the metropolitan area newspapers  
combined ("i  should be taken seriously," she wrote). her letter made  
the rounds of  the ladies in steinbrenner's office. waldman walked in a 
 hero, only to  be greeted by steinbrenner's chauvinistic babble.... that's how this relationship began. early on, long before she became  the yankees radio analyst, he critiqued her work, canvassing his  favorite manhattan
   saloon keepers and asking: "what do you think of that girl?" in times
   of trouble, steinbrenner was there. he became a coveted source,   
providing the kind of access and info other reporters did not normally  receive."...yankee team broadcasters, mlb.com: suzyn waldman bio is number 5--------------------------
citation #7, yankee leadership, 2 ken davidoff articles
10/2/08, "cashman aims to win with dysfunctional yankees," newsday, ken davidoff (link inactive but posted elsewhere)

""but in their quest to regain the mantle as baseball's elite team, they still face
a quandary that shows no sign of going away:they're muddled at the top, above cashman.  from speaking to employees up and down the organizational food chain, you still get the sense that no one knows who's truly in charge. whereas george steinbrenner ruled all in his prime, obsessing over both $189-million agreements with derek jeter and uncollected garbage on the practice field in tampa, the organization lacks clarity today. the power flows, very unevenly, through these four outlets:  1. hal steinbrenner.
   he has worked hard in the last year to establish a relationship with 
  cashman and the baseball people, commuting to yankee stadium from his 
  tampa home nearly every week. but he is human, unlike his dad, in that
   he can't get his tentacles over everything.2. hank steinbrenner.
   the "advisory-board" comments -- there will be no advisory board,   
cashman confirmed wednesday -- provide further proof that hank is a   
highly entertaining fraud. as long as he's got his last name, however,  
 hank won't be ignored altogether.
3. felix lopez.  the 
husband of george steinbrenner's younger daughter jessica, lopez  has 
exploited hal's and hank's limits to gain a surprising amount of  power 
over the tampa-based operations. lopez is known as such a bully  and a 
boor that he makes hank steinbrenner look like a gentleman and a scholar, in comparison.4. randy levine. the
   head of everything in new york, including the yankees' role in yes 
and   the new yankee stadium, team president levine used to be 
predictable  in  that he would carry out george steinbrenner's wishes. 
now, with the  boss  largely resting in the background, levine sits as 
more of a wild  card. from this, you have people wondering who really runs things. it's a question that, in reality, probably will fade only if, or when, the steinbrenner family sells the team.
    so in the interim, the yankees will put forward their best words."  
 from ken davidoff newsday column, 10/2/08, "cashman aims to win with   
dysfunctional yankees"-------------
second davidoff article:
5/16/11, "decision-makers off-target again," ken davidoff, newsday (newsday is subscription)
"there's already enough tension and lunacy around the organization.ailing reliever rafael soriano said after the game that george steinbrenner's  son-in-law, felix lopez -- whose background is in gardening, not  medicine -- advised him to take
a couple of weeks off to rest his ailing  elbow....tough, tough times for the yankees. "this is where you're tested as a team," girardi said. in that case, the people who run this operation need to study harder....successful industries,
   be they baseball, banking or bagels, place  their personnel in a   
position to succeed. and calibrate their  expectations accordingly. both on and off the field monday, the yankees failed at that skill. they can blame only themselves for the intensifying storm surrounding them.... at 20-19, three games behind the rays in the american league east, the yankees feel like a team in crisis. of course, most teams carry that aura when the results stink....and what in the name of thurman munson was yankees brass thinking when it interrupted derek jeter's day to discuss the comments he made sunday about jorge posada's saturday boycott?...speaking of not being surprised, you  could have set your watch to jeter's comments on sunday. he defended his  longtime friend and teammate while standing clear of posada's feud with  the yankees' front office. of
   course posada received preferential  treatment from the team captain.
   of course jeter wouldn't have been so  effusive had this been alex rodriguez or nick swisher pulling themselves out of a game against the red sox an hour before first pitch. this is who jeter is.
   he isn't much of  a captain. the yankees knew this when they agreed 
to   bring back the  iconic shortstop last winter for an over-market 
deal.  so  as long as  jeter isn't planning a rally on posada's behalf, it probably would've  been better to ignore jeter's comments."...---------------------------------
about baseball and radio. i copied the article when it came out. (the link is inactive):2/27/09, "'a great day to surf the (radio) waves'," cincinnati.com, daugherty  it's an intimate act, calling a baseball game, involving trust, respect and appreciation. we take our baseball broadcasters personally here, as personally as we take the reds."...
============columnist dan dimauro is a fan of john sterling and suzyn waldman
10/10/11, "sterling's a rare gem, don'cha know?" the day, mike dimauro"let me just say this: i don't care whether you like him. i like him. and  suzyn waldman, too. so do millions of yankee fans,
  otherwise known as  the target audience. sterling and waldman are part
  of every day from  april through october, eccentric, eclectic,  
entertaining and everywhere  the season takes us....
the (ny) times reported that mushnick "has written more than 270 articles  about sterling," calling him a "narcissistic, condescending blowhard."  then the best quote of all: "yankees fans who like him are people who just want someone to root for the team," mushnick said.  what, the yankees should go out and hire someone who hates them? 
or is more boring than geometry? and
  it's not like sterling and waldman never criticize the  yankees. they 
 do it often. (just wait till they fail to advance a  runner)....
it's ok to enhance the product with some personality, you know.
john sterling makes you listen because of what's coming. and what's not.  like one night this summer.
  we're on vacation in ocean city,  n.j., sipping some euphoric nectar 
on  the porch listening to the  ballgame. sterling is apoplectic that 
home  plate umpire jerry layne is  taking too long to call balls and strikes. suddenly, he breaks into  song: "everybody's hand in hand ... waitin' for jerry layne."it's a takeoff on an old sinatra lyric ("everybody's hand in hand, swingin' down the lane.")  i'm sorry. but that's perfect, brilliant and the essence of john sterling. and i want him back for as long as he wants to do it. i believe i speak for yankees universe on this.  and in this case, we should be the only ones who count. this is the opinion of day sports columnist mike dimauro."

  2009. (the original link is inactive now, so i use the link on my 
blog).hossrex: "there’s something classic about baseball, there’s something classic about radio, and there’s nothing more classic than baseball on the radio."...-----------------misc. citation

	 mariano explains to arod how to throw a cutter-june 2024, yankee stadium
	 
    

6/10/24,  “pitching lessons from the great @marianorivera!! #yankees #mlb,” arod twitter, via pinstripe alley

 above, yankee stadium, 6/10/2024, arod twitter
from pinstripe alley, 6/16/24: 
“mo teaches a-rod the cutter”
both mariano rivera and alex rodriguez were at yankee stadium last weekend [fri. 6/7/24-sun., 6/9/24] for the team’s much anticipated matchup with the los angeles dodgers.
 while there, a-rod met up with his former teammate and got him to 
record a video on how to throw the cutter. rather interestingly, rivera 
says that most pitchers who we say through cutters are actually throwing
 sliders, because they’re not releasing it like a fastball.
he also showed how he threw a sinker, taught to him by mel stottlemyer.”  .........................

above, 5/28/24, from erik boland twitter
final score 5/28/24, angels 4, yankees 3
…………………………………….
added: speaking of memories: one for them, one for us:
10/19/2009, alcs game 3 vs yankees in anaheim, angels win 5-4 in 11: 
alcs game 3, game tied 4-4. mo entered the game with the winning run on 2nd. he made a throwing error to third on a bunt. eventually bases were loaded with no out. rivera got out of it with no runs scoring.
 ground balls never left the infield. a sac fly would have won the game.
 the angels did win in the 11th after mo was gone. getty photo. final: angels 5, yankees 4.
………………………………………………
10/25/2009, alcs game 6, angels at yankees, angels dugout, 9th inning, getty. final score, yankees 5, angels 2. two innings by mo.
