land acknowledgementwe acknowledge that the land on which west hill united gathers is situated within the traditional and treaty territory of the mississaugas. more specifically, credit first nation's lands which were previously occupied by the seneca and huron wendat first nations.  the rights of indigenous peoples were finally recognized here in the williams treaties of 1923. this land is and will continue to be home to the indigenous peoples. let us acknowledge the mistakes and traumas of the past through authenticity and support truth and reconciliation. let us engage and celebrate indigenous communities by being leaders of action and acknowledging the united nations' declaration of rights of indigenous peoples and the truth and reconciliation commission's recommendations towards truth and reconciliation. let us keep these principles close as we continue towards truth and reconciliation and as we move forward with kindness and respect as a community.
