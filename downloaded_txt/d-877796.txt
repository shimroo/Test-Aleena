that was a terrific result - thank you. in this era of international collectors bidding remotely, dreweatts research made all the difference, the catalogue entry pinning down a solid background and provenance for the painting. i couldn’t be more pleased. congratulations!
gw






thank you very much indeed for all your help and guidance.  i am delighted with yesterday’s result and will undoubtedly be recommending you to my friends and family should they wish to auction their gemstone jewellery. your cv is very impressive and customer care ‘par excellence!’ wishing you and dreweatts all the very best for now and the future.

the dreweatts wine delivery service is excellent. to have it seamlessly included as part of process makes purchasing at auction so much more frictionless. it is also a very reasonable cost.  very few auction houses do this which invariably means that i have to call a number of locally based delivery companies, agree a fee, sign waivers, share proof of purchase and invoices paid….then arrange dates for pick-up and delivery.  great service.   thanks again.

our thanks go to all at dreweatts for their amazing dedication to our sale. it has been a long time in the making, with many twists in the road. but we come away with nothing but praise and admiration for all of the team, from every angle and department. from top to bottom, there’s not one member of the team that we wouldn’t want to work with again. many thanks for everything. and for doing the alchemist manfredi proud.

aside from maximising our return, dreweatts could not have handled the process of dispersing our collection with more warmth, professionalism, and attention to detail.  they took a task that seemed incredibly stressful and overwhelming and turned it into something enjoyable.

from the outset of the collaboration … dreweatts understood how to communication this to an international audience with their thoughtful marketing campaign, stunning printed catalogue and impressive digital outreach.  lady de rothschild would have been equally thrilled and delighted with how sensitively every element was handled.
tomasz starzewski






i came down to view the auction on saturday.  i’ve been to dreweatts before, but i was astounded by how helpful, charming, polite and professional everyone was who works there. every single person i came into contact with was quite wonderful.  thank you so much for your help.

i just wanted to thank you for making the whole process of selling the tiara that we owned so easy and straightforward. it was kind of you to come up here twice, first to look at it and then to collect it. the photographs of the piece were quite excellent and very appealing. i was delighted to see the advertisement in the country life and i am sure all that coverage helped with the selling price that you achieved. we were very pleased. i rang the main desk a couple of times and each time the staff were extremely helpful and delightful to talk to, so all in all, my experience of selling through dreweatts was a thoroughly good one.

in the meantime, thank you and all those involved for your help and efficiency in selling the tiara.
ab






we are absolutely delighted with the prices attained on our lots at today’s sale and realise all too well that your detailed descriptions, condition reports and lotting decisions made a massive difference to the outcomes. so thank you. we had no idea, for instance, that the brooch was portuguese in origin or that the amber beads were indeed amber! the research you’d carried out, your knowledge and expertise really did make all the difference. but perhaps more important than all of that, may i thank you for being so positive and kind when we came to see you in march. i left knowing that we had made the right decision in bringing the jewellery to dreweatts.

i just wanted to write to let you know how grateful we are for your exceptional help and organisation earlier this month. the process couldn't have gone more smoothly with you helping us at each step of the way and guiding us to the final successful conclusion where the pieces made far in excess of their reserves. we felt we couldn't have been in better or more knowledgeable hands.  please pass on our gratitude to the dreweatts team.

this was the first time i participated in a live online auction.  i made several enquiries by phone prior to the auction and all my beginner's questions were answered in the most patient and professional way. i found the whole process easy and pleasant to engage in.  i will be back!
 zg






everybody at dreweatts did us proud and the coverage the auction obtained was marvellous.  thanks all round to the dreweatts team.
simon parker bowles






dreweatts have been such a great pleasure to work with, we have so appreciated your counsel across so many issues, and your patience and diplomacy with us all as a family! 
thank you for the adventure … and for making it so much less stressful and, at times, enormous fun.
william sitwell dl






i was really thrilled to see how well the two chinese ceramics auctions last week went. the prices are eye-popping. my father clearly had a very good eye.  i have been hugely impressed by both mark and dreweatts, that mark and his colleagues have been incredibly helpful throughout the process and that we have been delighted with the hammer prices achieved. i would have no hesitation in recommending dreweatts to anyone else looking for an auction house to sell antique furniture, fine art, asian works of art and jewellery.

this is just a quick email to thank you for guiding me through the online bidding process this week. i did get some of the lots that i had on my shopping list so it was as good day for me.  as it was my first venture into online bidding, i was slightly uncertain of what to expect but i have to report that your bidding system worked perfectly and was very clear to the user.  thanks again for your help and best wishes to you and the team.

this week i had the pleasure of, once again, buying at auction through dreweatts. i wanted to record my thanks to all the staff i had contact with. always courteous and extremely helpful. sadly, it is in my experience rare nowadays to find this kind of service.
ma






the donnington priory people looked after my best interests, and they did a selection of my collection proud. i would wholeheartedly recommend any vendor, who enjoys success, to consider dreweatts, given their expertise, efficiency, and enormous helpfulness.
gl






i have just collected my inkwell from you. i just wanted to say what an absolute pleasure it was dealing with dreweatts. leah was so kind, and guided me through the viewing, the lady on the telephone for my bid was so calm and helpful.  the porter (sorry, i don't know the gentleman's name), was lovely.   he remembered me viewing it, and said he was glad i was successful! a lovely experience, especially when you are busy.
sh






a note to thank you personally for your help.  from your valuation visit, through to first and second auctions and receipt of payment into the estate, the whole process has been professional and smooth and all within the confines of a pandemic!
ap






i just wanted to thank everyone at dreweatts for making my first ever auction experience so positive and easy. even during these covid difficult times dreweatts made the whole process so straight forward.

from the lady who answered the phone when i first called to enquire about registering for the auction on 20th april, through to the lady i met in reception yesterday when i came to collect my purchase, everyone i have encountered has been very polite, very cheerful and very helpful.  i must mention the porter who helped load my purchase into my vehicle - apologies but i did not catch his name. again, a cheerful person, very polite and nothing was too much trouble.

as a customer, it seems all too rare a thing these days to have such a positive experience with any form of business.

thank you once again and may i wish dreweatts every continued success.
