office of field experiences

field experiences mark the culmination of our students' journey to becoming teachers.
                           this immersive phase is where theory meets practice, allowing future educators to
                           apply their knowledge in real-world classrooms under the guidance of dedicated mentor
                           teachers.
students can access essential information related to the practicum and student teaching
                           internship field experiences here. schools, school districts, and local teachers can
                           also learn more about partnership opportunities and how to become a mentor teacher.

meet mitchell grilliot
'22, bachelor of education in early childhood education grades pre-k-5
grilliot said that he learned a great deal about teaching globally and was able to
                                 take what he learned into the classroom in toledo. âfrom my field experiences, one
                                 thing i have learned is that rapport really matters. students will always remember
                                 a teacher they connected with, and they always learn the most from those teachers.â

meet chitranjan greer-travis
earning his ph.d. in philosophy of education
âi recalled my experience at the university of toledo as a student in the philosophy
                                 m.a. program. i was challenged and nurtured in the program in such a way that i wanted
                                 to âreturn to my roots,â so to speak. in my quest to follow my dreams and live a bit
                                 more authentically, i gave graduate school some thought. philosophy of education appealed
                                 to me after falling in love with teaching philosophy. i also appreciate the social
                                 and political investigations that are investigated.â

meet terri draper
'22, bachelor of education in adolescent and young adult education, bachelor of arts
                                    in english
âi want to bring spanish language and literature to classes i teach in the future,
                                 so my students are exposed to other cultures and perspectives. i remember learning
                                 so much about american and white european literature in school. i think it would be
                                 better for students to hear about latin american, african and other cultures earlier
                                 in their education.â

meet alec finch
'23, bachelor of education in special education intervention specialist
âi decided to combine the two things i enjoy the most. teaching and making people
                                 happier; i feel that in special education, i am able to do those things effectively.
                                 â and now as he approaches graduation, alec said his journey at utoledo has made him
                                 more confident, particularly as a teacher working with younger students.
