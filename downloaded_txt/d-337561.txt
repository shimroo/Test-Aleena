 look again 



celebrating the harnett museum and study center as a place for teaching and experiential learning with art, look again highlights a fresh approach to building an art collection for the university of richmond. this exhibition features drawings, paintings, prints, photographs, ceramics, and coins acquired with our curriculum in mind and chosen in dialogue with our academic community. as we welcome diverse voices, media, and practices into our library of visual objects, we invite you to enjoy the interpretive writing of our students and faculty throughout the gallery.

 current exhibition 



 museums+ 



working collaboratively with faculty from any field of study, we present objects from the collection in museums+ that inspire compelling conversations with students about key topics and concepts in their courses. through this initiative, the ur museums invite classes into the galleries to explore how collection objects spark conversations with the images, texts, and data sets they study in the classroom.
