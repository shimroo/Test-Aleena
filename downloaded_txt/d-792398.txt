do you live in this middle tennessee city?


					published on: june 24th, 2024


do you live in this middle tennessee city? it’s one of america’s 15 fastest-growing cities
by jeremy tanner imay 18, 2024 ithe hill
with just a couple of exceptions, the fastest-growing cities in america are located in the south, according to new data from the u.s. census bureau.
between july 1, 2022 and july 1, 2023, the most recent data available, texas cities dominated the list of the fastest-growing 15.
"the population growth across the south in 2023 was driven by significant numeric and percentage gains among its cities," said crystal delbé, a statistician in the census bureau’s population division. "thirteen of the 15 fastest-growing cities were in the south, with eight in texas alone."
top 15 fastest growing cities
celina, located near dallas, grew by more than a quarter – a whopping 53 times the national growth rate of 0.5%, according to the census bureau.
outside of southern communities, the only two to make the list of fastest-growing cities were lathrop, california (13.6%) and athens, ohio (8.6%).
when it comes to the largest total gains, san antonio, texas was first (21,970), followed by fort worth, texas (21,365) and charlotte, n.c. (15,607).
prior analyses by the national association of realtors found that people moving within the united states in 2022 tended to leave large states and metropolitan areas to save money amid soaring mortgage and inflation rates.
how is population shifting in cities or towns in your state?
population growth in u.s. cities is also caused by international migration, with 1,138,989 foreign nationals moving to the united states, according to census data.
states that received the greatest influx of new residents from abroad were florida (178,432), california (150,983), texas (128,982), new york (73,867) and massachusetts (50,647).
when it comes to domestic migration, these states lost the most people: california (-338,371), new york (-216,778), illinois (-83,839), and new jersey (-44,666).
states with the biggest domestic migration gains were florida (194,438), texas (186,767), north carolina (97,264) and south carolina (82,562).

lebanon among nation's fastest-growing cities

by meg wrather – managing editor imay 23, 2024 i nashvillebusinessjournal.com




lebanon's public square continues to attract new tenants.
one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities is located right here in middle tennessee.
lebanon is the 12th fastest-growing city in the country, according to recently released population estimates from the census bureau.


top 15 fastest growing cities



the wilson county city, about 30 miles east of nashville, grew 8.9% from july 1, 2022, to july 1, 2023.
the city and county have been a target for both new residents and corporate expansions in recent years. multiple companies, including bridgetown natural foods llc, lochinvar llc and rei have announced plans to open manufacturing or distribution facilities in the community.
the state has announced close to 20 economic development projects in the county since 2020, totaling 6,300 jobs and over a billion in investment.
lebanon’s leadership is also working to attract restaurants and other amenities. the city recently recruited sit-down restaurant aubrey’s under a $1.5 million economic development incentive.
the south tops the census' list of regions with the fastest-growing cities of a population of at least 20,000.
cities in the south grew by an average of 1%. celina, texas, was the fastest-growing city, with a 26.6% increase.
"the population growth across the south in 2023 was driven by significant numeric and percentage gains among its cities," said crystal delbé, a statistician in the census bureau’s population division, in a news release. "thirteen of the 15 fastest-growing cities were in the south, with eight in texas alone."
metro nashville gained more than 5,600 residents last year, making music city the 21st largest city in the country. the city’s population increased 0.83%, to 687,788. zooming out, tennessee as a whole grew by 1.1%
new york city is the most populous city in the country, according to the census bureau, with 8.3 million residents.

millennials are driving the demand


					published on: september 2nd, 2020


millennials are driving the demand for condos as sales increase in certain markets – 2019 data reveals
austin, new york, and naples experienced increase in condo sales in 2019
by archana pradhan | aug 17, 2020 | corelogic.com
for millennials, first-time homebuyers (fthbs), and down-sizing baby boomers, condos can be the most reasonable option when buying a property. their values and lifestyle drive them toward buying condos because they tend to be more affordable than single-family homes and because condos typically come with a lower maintenance burden and are mostly located in urban cores.
condo share of total sales 2019
based on the top 25 markets, the average sale price of condos in 2019 was 16% lower than the average sale price of single-family residences.
to support that point, corelogic fraud consortium loan application data shows that fthbs gravitate toward condos. last year, about 40% of all condo-purchase mortgage applications were submitted by fthbs, compared to just 33% of all non-condo purchase mortgage applications by the same group. additionally, the data shows condos were more popular with millennials – 47% of all condo-purchase mortgage applications were submitted by millennials in 2019, up 2% from 2018.
condo sales 2018 -2019
geographically, in 2019, the condo share of sales activity by state was highest in hawaii (46%), followed by washington d.c. (42%), massachusetts (20%), florida (18%) and illinois (17%) (figure 1). at the metro level, condo sales activity also varied. in 2019, eight of the top 25 condo markets experienced increases in condo sales relative to the prior year (figure 2). however, in 2018, only 12 of those top 25 condo markets experienced increases in condo sales relative to the prior year.
among the top 25 markets with the most condo sales, austin, texas, had the largest annual increase in condo sales in 2019, with a gain of 12%, followed by:

new york, n.y. (6%)
naples, fla. (3%)
san diego, calif. (3%)
and denver, colo. (3%)

miami, fla. and warren, mich. experienced the largest annual drop in condo sales, with a decline of 11%, followed by:

atlanta, ga. (-9%)
orlando, fla. (-9%)
honolulu, hawaii (-9%)
and las vegas, nev. (-9%)

millennials and condo demand
given worsening affordability challenges in many markets, condos could be a viable option for many. however, condo supply remains tight; according to corelogic mls data, months’ supply for condos fell to four months in december 2019 – the lowest since 2006.
in the coming years, younger millennials (age 30 or below) are likely to drive much of the condo demand as they are a very large group (figure 3). still, there will be more condo demand than supply as young millennials approach peak household formation and home buying age.

data source: corelogic truestandings
 the 25 largest condo markets were defined at the core based statistical area (cbsa) level and determined based on total condominium sales between 2000 and 2019 according to corelogic.
 the months’ supply indicates how long it would take to sell all the current for-sale inventory (assuming no new supply hits the market) at the current sales rate.

july home sales show recovery is sticking


					published on: august 26th, 2020


july home sales show recovery is sticking
  august 21, 2020 | realtor.com
nar existing home sales july 2020
existing-home sales soared 24.7% in july, outpacing their record growth of 20.7% in june, when the nation’s economic reopening ignited home buying activity, the national association of realtors® reported friday. now 8.7% higher year over year, the strong rise in existing-home sales—including single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and co-ops—is fueling optimism in the real estate market through the rest of the year.
"the housing market is well past the recovery phase and is now booming with higher home sales compared to the pre-pandemic days," says nar chief economist lawrence yun. "with the sizable shift in remote work, current homeowners are looking for larger homes—and this will lead to a secondary level of demand, even into 2021."
home prices, too, are reaching new all-time highs, with the national median existing-home price hitting $304,100 in july—the first time it’s ever broken $300,000, according to nar. however, low inventory stands to limit gains moving forward. total housing inventory at the end of july totaled 1.5 million units, down 21.1% year over year. "the number of new listings is increasing, but they are quickly taken out of the market from heavy buyer competition," yun says. "more homes need to be built."
other important findings from nar’s july housing report include:

properties are selling fast. sold homes in july typically spent 22 days on the market, down from 24 in june.
fewer first-timers are in the market. the share of first-time buyers was 34%, down slightly from 35% in june.
investors are holding steady. the share of all-cash sales was 16%, unchanged from june.
distressed sales are down. foreclosures and short sales represented less than 1% of total sales, falling from 3% in june.
condo prices are increasing. the median existing condo price was $270,100 in july, an increase of 6.4% from a year ago.

"luxury homes in the suburbs are attracting buyers after having lagged the broader market for the past couple of years," yun says. "single-family homes are continuing to outperform condominium units, suggesting a preference shift for a larger home—including an extra room for a home office."
regional breakdown
july marked the second consecutive month that year-over-year sales and median home prices grew in each of the four major regions of the country, nar reported.

northeast: sales up 30.6%, median home price ($317,800) up 4%.
midwest: sales up 27.5%, median home price ($244,500) up 8%.
south: sales up 19.4%, median home price ($268,500), up 9.9%.
west: sales up 30.5%, median home price ($453,800) up 11.3%.

why a pandemic, recession, and protests aren't keeping the housing market from roaring back


					published on: july 15th, 2020


why a pandemic, recession, and protests aren't keeping the housing market from roaring back
by clare trapasso | jul 13, 2020 | realtor.com
article

the housing market is back—and then some.
despite the crippling and ongoing coronavirus pandemic, millions out of work, a recession, a national reckoning over systemic racism, and a highly contentious presidential election just around the corner, the residential real estate market is staging an astonishing rebound.
median home prices shot up 6.2% year over year on realtor.com® in the week ending june 27, according to weekly realtor.com data. homes are selling faster than they did in 2019, when no one had heard of covid-19. and bidding wars are back as first-time and trade-up buyers who have lost out on other homes slug it out.

"the housing recovery has been nothing short of remarkable," says ali wolf, chief economist of meyers research, a national real estate consultancy. "the expectation was that housing would be crushed. it was—for about two months—and then it came roaring back."
it's a far cry from the great recession of more than a decade ago, when home prices plummeted, mortgages were plunged under water, and foreclosures seemed to appear on just about every block. but of course, the overbuilt housing market and subprime mortgages helped cause that crisis. back then there were a glut of homes for sale and not many eager buyers. this time it's reversed.
"people are really quick today to compare today with the great recession," says wolf. "but we’re dealing with a different animal."
to be sure, there are plenty of danger signs ahead in this economy, including continuing historic levels of unemployment and rising coronavirus infection rates in many parts of the country. but, for now, real estate is bouncing back much quicker than other bellwether industries.
the reason: after months on hold, americans are beginning to feel more confident about the idea of buying or selling a home.
nearly two-thirds of consumers, 61%, said it was a good time to buy a home in june, in a fannie mae housing survey of 1,000 participants. that was a 9 percentage point increase from may. roughly 41% of respondents said it was a good time to sell, also an increase of 9 percentage points from the previous month.
that optimism translated to a surge of mortgage applications for home purchases. they rose 33.2% year over year in the week ending july 3, according to the mortgage bankers association.
and while the number of sales is way down, there are signs they could begin to catch up to the typical level of the normally busy summer home-buying season.
the number of sales of existing homes (previously lived-in residences) plummeted 26.6% annually in may, according to the latest data from the national association of realtors®. however, pending sales, which are purchases that haven't closed yet, surged 44.3% from april to may. they were down only 5.1% compared with 2019.
so what's driving this surprisingly hot market? there's a slew of culprits.
shortage of homes for sale, low mortgage rates driving home price hikes
home prices are climbing right back up, despite the recession, for one big reason: there is a severe shortage of homes for sale. that's great for sellers, but not so great for buyers.
home listings are down 31% annually in the week ending july 4, according to realtor.com data. that's roughly a third less inventory than last year—when there was already a shortfall in available homes. in fact, before the pandemic, there was a shortage of roughly 4 million homes—and that's a conservative estimate, says realtor.com senior economist georgeratiu.
throw in a health crisis that spooks sellers from listing their properties, hundreds of thousands of construction jobs disappearing this spring, and a pause in building in most areas, and suddenly the gap between a very limited supply and strong demand from would-be buyers becomes a chasm.
"the number of buyers in the market far outstrips the number of homes available," says ratiu. that leads to higher prices—even amid a recession and the worst u.s. public health crisis in a century.
another major reason for the housing market's rebound is the record-low mortgage interest rates, a siren song for buyers on a limited budget. some of the most qualified borrowers are scoring rates just south of 3%, which is low enough to potentially shave more than a hundred dollars off a monthly loan payment and tens of thousands of dollars off the life of the mortgage.
"people are thinking, 'i'll never see a rate this low again,'" says rocke andrews, president of the national association of mortgage brokers. he's also a mortgage broker at lending arizona in tucson.
the average mortgage rate fell to 3.03% for 30-year fixed-rate loans in the week ending july 9, according to freddie mac. that's the lowest they've been since freddie began tracking rates in 1971.
"we basically have free money right now," says meyers' wolf. "even as prices go up, the price gains are offset by the continued drop in mortgage rates."
the low rates may also make it cheaper to buy than rent in some markets—provided buyers have pulled together the down payment, says economist gay cororaton, director of nar's housing and commercial research. the economic uncertainty right now may have also made folks want to lock in their housing costs, so they're not affected by rising rents.
"if you’re a white-collar worker who didn’t get laid off and you have savings, the math works for you," says cororaton.
why there are so many buyers in the market
there's an awful lot of pent-up demand from buyers who were stymied by the novel coronavirus in the spring. these are the folks who were forced to postpone their searches in march, april, and may. some are first-time buyers with growing families who need the extra space pronto.
they're now back in force, competing with those who had planned to buy in the summer—along with the city folks suddenly seeking a single-family home of their own, a more spacious abode with a home office (or two), and outdoor space.
"they’ve been at home for months, and they’re going, 'if i’m going to spend the next six to 12 months working out of my house, i need a bigger house,'" says mortgage broker andrews.
it's also easier today to take care of much of the lending and home-buying process online—where you don't have to worry about contracting the virus, says jim gaines, chief economist at the real estate center at texas a&m university.
surprisingly, even with the worst unemployment since the great depression, nationally topping 11% last month, the majority of working americans have held on to their jobs.
many higher-paid workers—the ones with the means to buy homes—have been relatively insulated from much of the carnage. lower-wage workers (e.g., bartenders, restaurant servers, and retail employees) were harder hit by the furloughs and layoffs. roughly 39% of workers with household incomes below $40,000 lost their jobs in march, according to a federal reserve report from may. these were folks who had been working in february.
many of those still-employed workers with good-paying jobs have even boosted their savings, making it easier to cover down payments and closing costs. after all, they're not spending as much on vacations, clothes, or restaurants due to the pandemic. many have also been able to stash away their stimulus checks.
"you defer your student loans, you received a stimulus check, you’re not going anywhere, and all of a sudden you have a down payment," says wolf. "you only need a 3.5% for some mortgages."
could home prices eventually fall?
buyers shouldn't expect deep discounts during this recession—at least not yet. unlike the great recession, a flood of foreclosures isn't expected to hit the market, bringing prices down.
this time around the federal government offered homeowners with government-backed loans (just over half of loans) mortgage forbearance to stave off another foreclosure crisis. many private lenders followed the government's lead.
the forbearance is good for up to 12 months. it also allows borrowers to work out repayment plans and tack on missed payments to the end of the loans.
prices could flatten or even dip if there is a surge in foreclosures following the end of the forbearance period, says wolf. mortgage rates shooting back up into the 4.5% and 5% range could also slow—or even halt—their climb.
"home prices don’t fall just because," says wolf. "there needs to be a catalyst or some kind of imbalance."

early morning march 3, 2020 many wilson county residents were awakened with an eas tornado warning.  what we did not know was that this particular storm would leave in its wake a 50+ mile path of destruction ranging from an ef3-ef4.
no one likes to be awakened with an alarm going off on their phone, but these were lifesaving alerts.  keep in mind that the eas alerts happen no matter what your phone settings are set to (even if do not disturb is turned on!).  if you are in the designated area for the tornado warning, you will receive this alert.  thankfully, this tornado did pass through our community early in the morning – we have schools received heavy damage, roads were virtually empty and businesses did not have their teams working.
