					welcome to the ruhaniat			





toward the one, the perfection of love, harmony, and beauty, the only being,united with all the illuminated souls, who form the embodiment of the master, the spirit of guidance.

  



  
       
 
       
  


 

we are a world-wide spiritual family, walking in the footsteps of murshid samuel l. lewis, our founder, and hazrat inayat khan, his teacher, who brought "the sufi message of spiritual liberty" from india to the west in 1910.
our stated mission is "helping individuals unfold their highest spiritual purpose, manifest their essential inner being, and live harmoniously with others with the hope of relieving suffering and contributing to the awakening of all of humankind".
