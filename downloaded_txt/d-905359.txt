spotlight review — 
				practical homeschooling

                ... here's what sold me on this program. while doing psat 
				preparation we learned that my oldest (and math resistant) 
				daughter was weak on probability, so i had her work with the 
				word problems/probability cd. initially she had some trouble. 
				now, normally this would mean waiting till the regular math 
				tutor (me) was available, but because of the immediate and 
				untiring ability of this program to provide help (lessons, an 
				infinite number of sample problems, general guidance in how to 
				start and hints for specific problems) she was able to 
				understand the new concepts on her own!

                    math-teacher
                

                    math-teacher makes the teaching and learning of math
                    as easy as math can get! mathematics builds
                    progressively from concept to concept. math-teacher
                    helps students understand each concept before moving
                    on to the next. each lesson first presents the
                    concepts and an infinite number of sample problems.
                

                the interactive tutorial requires no pencils and paper! no
                multiple choice or fill in the blank, math-teacher
                understands every step of a student's solution! students
                type symbolic expressions in a free-style format,
                math-teacher analyzes each line and indicates whether it
                is correct or not. this analysis detects common mistakes
                and provides focused help. the process repeats until the
                answer is reached. math-teacher perceives the proficiency
                of the student and generates problems accordingly.several levels of help are provided, including: 
                

online textbook with a lesson on each concept
sample problems with detailed solutions
general guidance on how to begin or continue a problem 
					
hints to solve a specific problem

each module covers 1 to 1.5 years of mathematical
                concepts. the customization utility allows the instructor
                to fine tune and control the tutorial and on-screen tests.
                the timed on-screen tests display all problems so the
                student can choose the one to answer next (duration,
                difficulty and scope can be customized).the problems generator for printed tests prints problems
                with and without answers, as homework or as hardcopy
                tests. the step-by-step answers are complete with
                explanations, charts, figures, graphs, and tables.the calculator provided in math-teacher is designed to
                work with algebraic expressions. rational expressions
                yield both rational and the approximate real results.
                student scores are collected automatically to simplify
                record keeping.these unique features make math-teacher the private tutor
                of each student!



                    interactive tutorial
                


                        flexibility in solving problems
                    

                        students can choose their own solving route and
                        are not confused by the limited acceptable exposï¿½s
                        used by our competitors
                    

                        guidance provided on how to start each problem if needed
                    

                        smart hints catch common errors
                    

                        difficulty adjusts to the student's competence
                    



                     math for middle school, high school and college
