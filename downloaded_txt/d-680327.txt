miami valley astronomical societythe universe is yours to discoverwelcome to the miami valley astronomical society

the john bryan state park observatory
since 1918 the mvas has been the face of amateur astronomy in the miami valley dedicated to educating the public about science of astronomy and fostering the growth of amateur astronomy and fellowship. to that end, the non-profit mvas, annually engages thousands of individuals through its monthly meetings, stargazes, and outreach programs. the society also operates the john bryan observatory (jbo) located at john bryan state park.
membership renewal period open now until march 14, 2025
please note that mvas accepts new members throughout the year. please click here to learn more about how to join.
next general meeting
unless otherwise posted, the mvas holds general meetings starting at 7:00 pm on the second friday of each month at the vfw post #3283, 5074 nebraska ave., huber heights, ohio. these meetings usually include 30-45 minutes of business and discussions, followed by a brief social period and a 30 to 45-minute program.
note that the vfw has a long driveway and sits behind the american legion post 200 on nebraska avenue. please turn into the driveway with the vfw sign and follow back to the vfw building. if you use google maps (or similar software) to guide you to the vfw, make sure that the directions include turning onto nebraska ave. it has come to our attention that such web-enabled software has instructed some people to park on bellefontaine rd or leeper st and walk across private property to reach the vfw. we do not recommend this.
our next general meeting is scheduled for friday, february 14th starting at 7:00 pm at the vfw post #3283, 5074 nebraska ave. steve hildenbrandt will present the next installment of constellation of the month; lynx. if you’d like to share your astrophotos be sure to send them to stephen hildenbrandt at events@mvas.org by wednesday before the meeting so he can include them in the slide deck. the program for this month will be a presented by mvas member alan zucksworth on the lunar eclipse that will be occurring on march 14. if time permits, steve hildenbrandt will discuss our annual spring messier marathon.
