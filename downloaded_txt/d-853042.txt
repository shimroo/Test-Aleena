more about hydro quality group

water is of the essence in our lives and not only do we use it for drinking and cleaning but we also use it for various sports. given its vast uses, it is necessary that water quality gets maintained.

hydro quality group is an organization that we came up with in a bid to ensure that the water we use in sports is of high quality. made up of five members, we research how water can get contaminated as well as methods which people can put to use to ensure that pools remain clean.
olympic water sports are exhilarating to watch and take part in, but all this excitement can come to an end if the water quality is low. most people do not comprehend the dangers that come about as a result of swimming in unclean water. the risks involved in swimming in contaminated water extend to skin diseases, eye problems and digestive issues when someone swallows the pool water.
we have come across cases where people contracted all manner of diseases from taking a dip in contaminated water, and we believe that these problems can get avoided by taking some measures. other than ensuring that all the drains in the swimming pools work, there are cleaning procedures to which cleaners should adhere as well as specific chemicals that should be used to get rid of harmful microorganisms.
our primary focus is on olympic swimming sports where a large number of athletes come together to compete for various prizes. given how often these pools get used, they get just as dirty as public swimming pools, and there is a need for extra measures to ensure that the water is suitable for swimming.
some people go too far in their prevention strategies, and they use too many chemicals in the water. though the water will remain clean thanks to such measures, people suffer from skin reactions to the substances in the water, and thus the quality of the water is not good.
the key to maintaining a clean pool is to implement measures in moderation. we teach people the dangers of contaminated water bodies, how to clean their pools, what chemicals to use, the right equipment for such jobs, how often to change the water and other aspects necessary in ensuring that the water quality is high.
our research will help you not only to manage any pool with positive results but to improve water quality in general. availability and quality of municipal drinking water systems is of extreme importance to any country - india, jordan & yemen at the top. swimming sports are therefore not a priory of the governments there (for example compare the popilarity of swimming events and cricket matches in india and you will understand why cricket betting sites are so many).
regardless of improvements to drinking water, many other water sources are contaminated with both bio and chemical pollutants - over 21% of the india's diseases are water-related. ð¢he first step in solving this crisis is to understand the problem at hand and figure out what needs to be addressed.
