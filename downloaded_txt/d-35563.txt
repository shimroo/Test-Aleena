welcome
this site features photos from aviation museums, multiple air shows, and places we found interesting during our travels 
            throughout the world. the military section includes u.s. military museums, 
            israeli armor, and spain's national day parade. if you like aircraft or armor, you've come to the right place. 
we hope you like the site and visit often as the content 
            will change and grow with time. as content is added, we will describe the changes on the what's new? page.
 
 
 
you will see a large difference in the quality of the photos. earlier years have poorer quality images because of less advanced cameras and editing. gradually we are re-scanning the old negatives and photos and will post improved images when we can.
