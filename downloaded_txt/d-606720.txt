passing away of srimat swami brahmasthanandaji maharaj

with deep sorrow, we announce the passing away of srimat swami brahmasthanandaji maharaj on sunday, 8th december 2024 at 9.15 pm. he was 82 years old and was suffering from old age ailments for the last few years.    revered brahmasthanandaji maharaj was the adhyaksha of ramakrishna math, nagpur for over 27 years i.e. from march 1996 to august 2023. due to deteriorating health conditions, he relinquished the headship in 2023 and continued to stay in the nagpur math.    revered maharaj received mantra diksha from most revered swami yatishwaranandaji maharaj in 1961. he joined the order under the then adhyaksha, the illustrious srimat swami bhaskareshwaranandaji maharaj in 1971. in 1982, he received sannyasa diksha. he also served at the ramakrishna math, hyderabad as the librarian and deputy director of the institute of languages for about 13 years. he assisted most revered swami ranganathanandaji maharaj who was the cultural ambassador of india and later on became the president of the ramakrishna order.
revered brahmasthanandaji maharaj also led the relief operations in dinajpur district, bangladesh in 1995. he was appointed as the adhyaksha of ramakrishna math, nagpur in march 1996. under his able leadership, the new universal temple was constructed in 2006. a new hostel building accommodating 50 underprivileged students also came up in 2009. in 2018, he started a multi-therapy unit to cater medical services for the marginalised people.      ramakrishna math, nagpur is well known for its marathi and hindi books on ramakrishna-vivekananda-vedanta literature. under the tenure of revered brahmasthanandaji maharaj, over 200 hindi-marathi books were published. the marathi translation of the spiritual classic meditation and spiritual life - ध्यान आणि आध्यात्मिक जीवन is credited on the name of revered maharaj apart from innumerable articles published in the marathi magazine viz. जीवन विकास.      in him, we have lost a source of divine consolation, inspiration and strength. however, his words and fond memories will continue to guide and illumine our spiritual journey towards the goal supreme.
