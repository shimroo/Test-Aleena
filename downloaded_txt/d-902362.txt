what our patients say 

"after suffering from severe neck and upper back pain for months, i began seeing dr. laura. for weeks, it was difficult to hold my head up and function at home and at work. after an initial period of repeated treatments, i now come in for treatment every 3-4 weeks.the progress i have made since starting chiropractic care has been miraculous! i have not had neck problems since february of 2004 and my back feels great. my current treatment is for preventative maintenance only.thank-you for your help. i feel great and owe it to dr. laura."-dave a.





what our patients say 

i began having low back pain and severe right leg pain and numbness in january 2004. my pain was limiting my daily physical activities and making life miserable. i did not notice any relief from conventional medical treatment and it wasn't until i met dr. craig at my health club that i considered chiropractic care. after an examination with dr. craig, he referred me for an mri which indicated some serious disc problems in my low back which were pinching nerves. i started on a treatment plan for chiropractic treatment and noticed the pain and numbness disappear.i have resumed all normal daily routines and exercise. i am very satisfied with the results of my treatment with dr. craig. i am returning to a healthy, active lifestyle and i am very pleased to be able to do this drug-free!-dave g.





what our patients say 

i started chiropractic care at gateway chiropractic center for severe migraine headaches as well as pain throughout my neck and back. i had been experiencing these problems since i was a teenager and had been using prescription medication for years. since starting chiropractic care it's been wonderful! the back pain and migraines are 100% better. i feel like i am a new woman!dr. laura and dr. craig are very personable and make you feel very welcome. my kids love to come for an adjustment and i have recommended them to several friends and family.-denise t.





what our patients say 

i have been experiencing arthritis related problems throughout my whole body since i was 13 years old. i have found that all other past treatments have not been as effective as my chiropractic care. i would not be able to function without chiropractic care and my treatments at gateway chiropractic center give me more freedom to move about and enjoy life with my son.-jeanne f.





what our patients say 

i saw dr. craig after taking a fall. it was my first chiropractor appointment ever. he did such a great job explaining the table to me and walking me through what to expect. i was amazed that i could actually walk normally again as soon as i got off the table!  - erica
