"we love harding. enrolling our daughter at harding was the best decision we could have made for her education and her spiritual growth."

















"the quality of the musicals continues to blow me away. it has been a rewarding experience for my kid, and it has helped her find her community at harding."

















"my child's coaches push him when needed, encourage him while he tries, and celebrate with him when he reaches a goal."

















"i love that we have a diverse teaching staff as well as diverse students. i'm so thankful for this being important to the core of our school."

















"i feel like our teachers genuinely care about my kids and our family. they make an effort to connect with my children and form meaningful relationships with them."


























teaching for transformation
we inform to transform. when students in african american history learn about ida b. wells, they discover how to be justice seekers today. when students build robots in engineering, they explore the universal order in all of creation. every class at harding academy is built for this kind of academic and spiritual growth.
