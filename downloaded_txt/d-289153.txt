about us





































						china’s separation of tibetan children from their parents into boarding schools and environmental destruction inside tibet					

						three out of every four tibetan children are forcibly separated from their families and placed in colonial-style boarding schools, with over 100,000 children aged four to six in preschools and 800,000 to 900,000 children aged six to eighteen being indoctrinated and stripped of their culture, religion, and linguistic identity, causing emotional and psychological trauma for the children. this accounts for 78% of the total tibetan student population.					


						take action now
