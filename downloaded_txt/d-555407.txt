“the great state of canada” — trump is saying what all american politicians are thinking

                        this is what i’m thinking: was canada ever an independent country?

all american politicians treat canada like a dependent (and canadian politicians allow it), but trump is the first one to say it so bluntly — so don’t shoot the messenger (literally).

the easy solution — especially when it comes to foreign policy — is, ready for it? stop allowing it.

yes, i’m the guy who yelled “free palestine!” at the wanda sykes show in toronto

                        since most people in western society are only able to see and think what they are told to see and think, here are my brief reactions to the above: absolutely, wanda sykes never should have raised war criminal kamala harris’ campaign and how she’ll “do everything in her power to get her elected”. i don’t want palestinian babies to be slaughtered, which, according to reaction #2ers, makes someone a “hamas supporter”. so, as they admit, this makes them advocates for baby killing. in case you don’t believe me, look at their public reactions to babies getting slaughtered.

the american foreign policy playbook: dehumanize, destroy, repeat.

                        tragically, macedonians are in the position of having experienced all of the weapons in the us arsenal, both literally and figuratively. carpet-bombing of civilians, forced expulsion, arming and supporting neo-nazis in their quest to eradicate macedonians, just to name a few. but i’ll get to all of that after i explain the current crop of american psychopaths. re-enter victoria nuland:

macedonian association ilinden tirana issues declaration rejecting census results in albania

                        the macedonian association "ilinden" - tirana rejects the preliminary results from the census in albania that took place between september 18th and november 16th, 2023, because of forgery of the number of ethnic macedonians, brutal interference in the internal affairs of albania on the part of the bulgarian embassy in tirana, the government in sofia and several foundations from bulgaria before and during the population census in albania.

mhrmi demands immediate return of macedonia's name/nullification of "prespa agreement"

                        macedonian human rights movement international demands the immediate nullification of the "prespa agreement", which illegally and forcibly changed macedonia's name into the highly derogatory "north macedonia" in 2019, and in contravention of the macedonian constitution, parliamentary rules, macedonian and international law, and multiple international human rights conventions. full details are below. nullifying this illegal treaty will return macedonia's name and guarantee its right to self-determination.

human rights violations against macedonians in bulgaria - annual report

                        bulgaria's official state policy continues to be the outright denial of the existence of the macedonian minority, as well as of macedonian identity, language, culture and history as a whole. it is this denial, along with the west's full endorsement of bulgaria's anti-macedonian policies, that has led to a dramatic rise in hatred and human rights violations against macedonians in bulgaria.
