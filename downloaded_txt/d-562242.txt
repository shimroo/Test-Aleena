"i am thrilled with 3d and dominic in particular. i sent my father in law with my husband, and they both came back glowing about how pleasant, and professional he was. i've been looking for a long time for a 4 runner with low mileage and a clean title...and i am ecstatic i was able to find one with 3d auto services."
