learn life skills

make it the best summer yet 



as a parent who cares a lot about your child’s development and happiness, it’s likely you’ve looked at many summer options for your child. 




the truth is, you’re not satisfied having your child spend the summer inside glued to electronic screens.imagine a summer where your child has the time of their life and grows as a person in ways that will impact who he or she is for the rest of their life.make this the summer that prepares your child to take on the world in a fun and inspiring outdoor environment. 




























join our summer camp family 



partnering with parents for 50 years 




as parents with young children in the summer of 1972, we founded roughing it with one bus, five fishing poles, and 17 campers. we had one motivation: to create a special camp experience for our own daughters and other children. you see, when we met as college-age counselors, we saw firsthand the power of camp in the life of a young person.
since then, one thing hasn’t changed: we believe that spending the summer surrounded by a supportive community in the great outdoors is an important part of growing up – and prepares kids to be confident and successful in the future.
for more than 50 years, roughing it has become a kind of family– campers returning year after year, campers becoming counselors, and even alumni bringing their children in their adult years. for each person our goal has been the same: to help generations of children grow up to lead happy and meaningful lives.
ann & hobie woods, camp directors for 50 years
