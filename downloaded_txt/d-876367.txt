 while an hourly employee of lowe’s, i had entered the class-action suit for overtime. years later, when the suit settled, i was a sales manager for lowe's. the store operations manager mentioned to me that i had been foolish to accept a check for a couple hundred dollars since it was going to cost me my job. from that point on, the store manager started writing me up for various issues to the point that he suspended me. i did not return after the suspension because i couldn’t deal with the constant stress.i don’t think lowe’s should have retaliated.

 working long hours and away from home cost me a lot of time away fromy family and almost cost me my marriage.  i was always stressed and never had time to eat or take breaks. i lost a lot of weight and was sickly skinny and very depressed.  there was never enough coverage in the departments so i was covering three of the busiest departments.  no managers would help, they were in the office snacking and talking about personal things.  i was very dedicated to my job and to the customers.  i always tried to make the customers happy but when there is only one of you to cover multiple departments it not easy. i was employeed at #756 in nm.
