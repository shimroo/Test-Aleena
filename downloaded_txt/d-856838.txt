i take pictures because they help to make sense of this world we’re in. since 1972, i have been a photographer and teacher, making pictures for knowledge, for fun, for art, and for my living. this site is a guide to a broad spectrum of my work- personal work, documentary photography, and commercial/editorial projects.
