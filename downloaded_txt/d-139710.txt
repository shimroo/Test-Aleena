the saints are more than lovely pictures on a holy card. if we dig a little deeper, their lives can challenge and transform our own. on february 8th, the church celebrates st. josephine bakhita. as a young girl, st. josephine was kidnapped from her family in darfur and sold into slavery at age nine. she was introduced to catholicism as an adolescent and experienced a profound love for jesus christ. st. josephine eventually gained legal freedom and entered religious life. though she bore over one hundred scars beneath her habit, st. josephine forgave her enemies and became known in the convent for her humility and joyful spirit.
author fr. jeff kirby writes, “saint josephine gives us all a scarred and human face to the evils of human trafficking, racial tension, and of the brutality found in the peripheries. her life demands a response.” as we approach the season of lent, let us recall our own call to conversion and an active concern for those who suffer.      ©lpi
