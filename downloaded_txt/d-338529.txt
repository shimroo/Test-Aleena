international gemini observatory
the international gemini observatory  provides the astronomical communities in six participant countries with state-of-the-art astronomical facilities that allocate observing time in proportion to each country's contribution. in addition to financial support, each country also contributes significant scientific and technical resources. the national research agencies that form the gemini partnership include: the us national science foundation (nsf), the canadian national research council (nrc), the chilean agencia nacional de investigación y desarrollo (anid), the brazilian ministério da ciência, tecnologia e inovação, the argentinean ministerio de ciencia, tecnología e innovación, and the korea astronomy and space institute (kasi). the observatory is managed by the association of universities for research in astronomy, inc. (aura) under a cooperative agreement with the nsf. the nsf also serves as the executive agency for the international partnership.
