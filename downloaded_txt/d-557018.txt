what is the secure act?



jan 14, 2020




i spent the morning reading through the highlights and some parts of the  actual text of the bill on the congress.gov website.  i’m liking most  of what see – many of these changes seem to be logical updates to  policies that have needed some attention for a while.

my take on interest rates



sep 16, 2019




the common wisdom over the past decade has been that interest rates  are going to rise.  i felt so good locking in a 3.5% mortgage rate  earlier this year because that was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  or  was it?

making sense of recent market volatility



nov 13, 2018




i’ve received a few calls this week to get my opinion on the current  market downturn.  its understandable considering october turned out to  be the worst month for stocks since october of 2008, shortly after…

keep your eye on the ball | reconsider selling positions during downturn



jan 20, 2016




i thought this would be a good time to refocus any of my readers out  there who may be getting distracted by the recent market decline.  for  the majority of investors, market volatility should either be ignored,  or treated as an opportunity to add to your portfolio at “sale” prices.

why hire a financial advisor?



may 27, 2015




while it may be the case that not everyone needs to work with a financial advisor, i think there is a tremendous amount of value which can be unlocked from such a relationship when the correct client/planner match is found.

gen y: the evolving financial planning practice



may 20, 2015




gen y is a large and increasingly affluent segment of the  population.  as the number of clients under 40 in my practice continues  to grow, i’m noticing clear themes emerging about what this demographic is looking for.

the case for universal life insurance as a conservative investment alternative



jan 7, 2015




everything we do in life involves some element of risk.  some risks  are known, and believed to be understood, while others are more  uncertain and involve either probability or magnitude that we find  difficult to quantify.

estate planning basics: what everyone should know



dec 16, 2014




i like to write at least one article on basic estate planning each  year because it’s just that important.  financial advisors spend years  working on financial plans and investment programs that can easily be  dislodged by overlooking small estate planning tasks.

financial planning & investment advisory fees – what is reasonable?



nov 17, 2014




from what i’ve seen, fee-based advisory firms, my own included, generally charge an annual fee which ranges from .75% to 1.75% of assets under management.  generally, the larger your account balance, the more likely you are to receive a lower fee.
