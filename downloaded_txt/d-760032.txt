 spotlight on faculty – from suzuki to stage! 






  

 event summary
featuring marcos kreutzer, tim shannon, rita george simmons, kathy tarantelli, michelle walker, grace wong, and katie worley, with yi-wen chang and julie ruhling on piano.

regarded as a method of teaching very young children how to play an instrument, the suzuki approach carries students from simple folk tunes to complex pieces of the standard professional repertoire. hochstein suzuki faculty will present some of these beloved pieces that our young students play and live with for years in a “grown-up” approach. it will be a concert for all ages and tastes!
admission at the door is $10 per person, with a $20 family maximum. concerts are free to hochstein students/families, faculty, and staff. the concert lasts about an hour, and is followed by a “meet the artists” reception.
