thank you for stopping by one of the most beautiful places in georgia–dooly county. your visit here will be worth the trip, whether you are looking for restored structures, quaint museums, victorian style homes, snowy fields of cotton, an easier lifestyle, or a fabulous fall festival. dooly county has it all!
 
located along interstate 75 in south central georgia, dooly county is part of georgia’s andersonville trail and presidential pathways travel region. the county boasts the largest cotton production in the state and leads the state in peanut production annually. this diverse region of the south is home to large industries, small businesses, recreational and cultural opportunities, excellent healthcare opportunities, as well as the very best in “southern hospitality.”
a major attraction each november in the southeast is the state’s official barbecue cooking championship, the big pig jig ®. listed among the nation’s top festivals, the event has received recognition as a “top 100 event” in north america and has been featured in “southern living” magazine. dooly county takes pride in this festival, which attracts more than ten times the county’s population each year.
a perfect retirement location, dooly county is just two hours south of atlanta and north of the florida state line. it offers a quiet, small-town atmosphere in reach of major metropolitan areas. with nearby americus, plains, andersonville, and columbus, the area is rich with history, yet abounds with activity.
discover dooly county and all it has waiting for you.
