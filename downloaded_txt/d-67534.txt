the original online field guide to tracks and
          tracking - since 1997.
 celebrating our 27th anniversary!
 
last updated: february 21, 2024


my name is beartracker (aka kim a. cabrera). i invite
          you to explore the world of tracking with me. i am interested in both
          animal and sar (search and rescue) tracking. when you explore this
          site, you will find information on animals and their tracks. i have
          also included links to my favorite tracking sites. as you follow the
          links below, you will find pictures of animal tracks and drawings. in
          addition to animal tracks, you will find pictures of the animals
          themselves and natural history information for each species. if you
          know how to identify animal tracks, you can tell who has visited the
          location. if you know about the habits of the animal, you will
          understand why it visited that place.
you cannot find tracks unless you go out and look for
          them. therefore, i have included a few tips on where to find them and
          even some links to my favorite tracking and hiking areas. 
this site is intended to be a source of information
          about north american animals and their tracks. i do not claim to be an
          expert tracker, just someone who loves tracking. my certification
          information is below, if you are curious. the joy of tracking is in
          solving the mysteries out there. every time you go tracking, you will
          find new stories written on the ground, just waiting for you to unlock
          their secrets. i learn more and more each time i go out for a walk. i
          invite you to explore this fascinating world with me. to get started,
          pick the type of animal you are interested in from the list below. i
          hope you have as much fun exploring this site as i'm having creating
          it.





 

beartracker on social media



many of you are finding tracks and coming to
                  this site to try to identify them. as well as this site, there
                  are some resources to help you on social media. here are the
                  places i recommend.
 
 
animal tracks, and tracking in general, are fascinating. to
                  meet other trackers, or just learn from others, you can find
                  my group on facebook. the group is called animals
                    don't cover their tracks and the link is: https://www.facebook.com/groups/271764596196849
 find a
                    track and want to tell everyone about it? want to find out
                    what others have learned about tracking? whether you track
                    animals or humans, you can post a message to the this group.
                    open to all trackers, anywhere, for the discussion of
                    anything related to tracking. animal tracks, human tracks,
                    or even bicycle tracks. it's a forum for all trackers. it is
                    intended to be a place where anyone can post a track they
                    have found and have some help identifying it. i recommend
                    including some sort of known object in your track photo to
                    give a sense of scale. if you would like them, there are
                    free printable rulers i made (pdf format) in a link lower
                    down on this page. 

 
also, i create many animal tracking and wildlife videos on
                  my youtube channel. the videos are about animal tracks and
                  sign, or just awesome captures from my trail cameras. i've got
                  a whole library of videos you can browse on my channel. the
                  link is: youtube.com/user/beartracker777

 
you can also find me at beartracker nature films
                  on facebook. here is the link: https://www.facebook.com/beartrackernature/

 
if you are interested in learning about how to become
                  certified as a wildlife tracker, check out the cybertracker
                  page. i highly recommend the cybertracker evaluation system.
                  it's a great way to learn tracking in-depth and to interact
                  with other trackers. i am certified by cybertracker as a track
                  and sign specialist, and trailing 2, and tracker 2. find out
                  more about what those certifications mean on that site. 
                  here is the link:  http://trackercertification.com/

you can also post your track finds on the north american
                  animal tracking database on inaturalist. i am a curator on
                  that project and many trackers there can help you identify
                  your finds. to join this page, you need to be a member of
                  inaturalist, which is free and just requires a sign-up. please include an
                    object of known size in your track photos so that there is a
                    scale to judge the track size from. you can print
                    my free tracking rulers below. 
 the link is: https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/north-american-animal-tracking-database

my track drawings are now available on t-shirts in my amazon
                  store. here are the
                    links to my designs. since there are frauds and thieves
                  out there who have stolen my designs, i recommend purchasing
                  only through the links i provide on this site. otherwise, you
                  will get a ripoff of my work and it won't be accurate. 

new track rulers i made with accurate track drawings.
                  available exclusively from me. see image below for how to
                  order.
