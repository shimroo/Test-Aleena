welcome to the village of necedah, wisconsin!
necedah is a friendly village nestled among   majestic rock formations, natural bluffs and pine trees. it is located near   petenwell lake, castle rock lake, and the wisconsin and yellow rivers. the   necedah national wildlife refuge and buckhorn state park are close by, and many   bike trails are within minutes. the necedah national wildlife refuge offers a   'back to nature' experience..

 
historical overview
necedah, wisconsin is   situated at the base of a high cliff on the yellow river, a few miles from its   mouth, and is opposite the famous petenwell rock. it was one of the most   important lumbering towns of this region and was the first place in juneau   county to have manufacturing   interests.
the name "necedah" comes from the ho   chunk peoples who inhabited the area before the arrival of european settlers and   means "land of the yellow waters", a reference to the yellow river.settlers began to explore the area in   the early 1840's. in 1848 the land was "ceded" to the u.s. government and thomas   weston and j.t. kingston arrived in the area and, as was the custom, staked   claims by "blazing" a tree on either side of the river and carving their names   and date on them.

information for homeowners & residents: sewer backup incidents


sewer backups are an unfortunate but common problem in u.s. cities and towns. although municipal departments make every effort to prevent such incidents, they still may occur. the following information is offered to help property owners and residents understand why backups happen, how they can be prevented, and what steps citizens should take if a sewer backup effects their property. the following questions and answers may be helpful:
what causes a sewer backup?
                  sanitary sewer overflows can be caused by a number of factors. they usually involve sewer pipe blockages in either main sewer lines or service laterals (lines between buildings and the main line). causes may include pipe breaks or cracks due to tree roots, system deterioration, insufficient system capacity due to residential or commercial growth, or construction mishaps. in home and office plumbing systems, the main cause is accumulation of grease, tree roots, hair, or solid materials, such as disposable diapers or sanitary napkins that are too large for wastewater pipes to handle. such materials may cause major backups in city lines as well as in residentsâ lateral lines. a frequent cause of water stoppages within the cityâs system, however, is vandalism. leaves, sticks, rocks, bricks and trash have been found stuffed down manholes. we hope you will report observations of any such activity.
how could a sewer backup affect me?
                  if the backup occurs in a city maintained line, the wastewater will normally overflow out of the lowest possible opening, which is usually a manhole. however, in some homesâespecially those with basements, or where the lowest level is even with the sewer linesâthe overflowing wastewater may exit through the homeâs lower drains and toilets.
what should i do if sewage backs up into my home?
                  first, take action to protect people and valuable property:
                  â¢ keeping in mind that ceramic plumbing fixtures such as toilets are fragile, quickly close all drain openings with stoppers or plugs. tub, sink, and floor drains may need additional weight to keep them sealed. a string mop can be used to help plug toilet openings.
                  â¢ donât run any water down your drains until the blockage has been cleared.
                  â¢ a quick check with nearby neighbors will help determine if the backup appears to be in your neighborâs wastewater line, and/or widespread in your neighborhood. in this case, call the department of public works immediately. numbers are listed at the end of this flyer.
                â¢ call a plumber if the problem is in your lateral service line.
