planting the seeds of curiosity and respect of all individuals, while growing strong roots for students and families, since 1977, the children’s garden is where children blossom into caring community members, full of wonder and possibility.nestled at the base of tiger mountain in a serene, park-like setting spanning six acres of natural woodlands, gardens, and hiking trails, the children’s garden school is the oldest preschool in issaquah.our charming school specializes in early childhood education for children ages 2.5 to 6, offering a rich, emergent, play-based curriculum in a nurturing atmosphere. we celebrate each child’s uniqueness, foster self-esteem, and encourage cooperation through mutual respect.with thoughtful programming and a passionate, dedicated staff, we integrate essential areas of development, including communication and social skills, reading and math readiness, science and nature exploration, cultural enrichment, and personal safety. creative arts—such as visual arts, music, movement, and literacy—are woven throughout our curriculum, providing a well-rounded foundation for every child’s growth.
