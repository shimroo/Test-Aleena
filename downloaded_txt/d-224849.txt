the stories behind
northern essex students, faculty, and staff








									elijah antunes, sga president 2023-2024								

									“student government is an organization where you can get your voice heard. students should be motivated and inspired. if they are interested in making a change, i encourage them to get involved and be disciplined. that’s what’s going to make the world a better place.”																			 meet elijah 








									brian mackenna-rice & lisa fabbri-lopez								

									“we work out in the field. and we learn that anybody can talk about this, but this is about behavior and what are you doing about it?” reflects mackenna-rice. “let’s not just pretend it’s a philosophy book. let’s understand it’s about life and human beings.”																			 meet lisa & brian 








									nayeli almanzar-lizardo								

									“i see a version of myself in each of my students; they inspire me every day. i remind them that everything works itself out in the end. i can’t imagine where else i’d be.”																			 meet nayeli
