sfra - schnauzer friends for rescue and adoption




























who we are

schnauzer friends for rescue and adoption is an all-volunteer, non-profit 501
(c)(3) organization of miniature schnauzer lovers that began saving lives by working 
with shelters and stray animal population reduction through spay/neuter programs in 
1996.  beginning with only a few admirers of the breed and taking in a few rescues at 
a time, sfra has remained steadfast in its commitment over the years to save as 
many lives as possible and to spread the word of the emotional fulfillment in adoption 
and the joys of the miniature schnauzer breed.

sfra works tirelessly to match each rescued miniature schnauzer to the perfect adoptive home.  each rescued dog is 
brought up to date on vaccinations, checked for heartworms and put on preventative, checked for other parasites, spayed or 
neutered, microchipped, and has other necessary medical procedures performed.  each dog is fostered in a loving foster 
home and offered medical rehabilitation, housebreaking and socialization skills, and given the chance to learn to trust again.  
prospective homes are carefully screened to match the needs of each individual rescued dog in order to provide the new 
forever home not only with the best companionship, but also to best meet the needs of the dog.

the average rescued miniature schnauzer is between four and seven years old.  we occasionally have a puppy and usually 
have a waiting list for them.  flexibility in requirements on the part of an adopter means a shorter wait in adopting.  reasons 
why dogs are surrendered to shelters or directly to sfra are many and varied.  most are not the dogsâ fault and sfra does 
not feel that our dogs are âthrowawayâ or temporary fixtures in a family.  we absolutely believe that each of our dogs will 
make a wonderful addition to most homes.  it is sfraâs goal to find the right home for that dog.

effective january 1, 2025, our adoption fee is $300 for each dog, with a seniors to seniors program available.  very often, 
this adoption fee does not cover the expenses incurred for a rescued dog.  sfra is not associated with any other rescue or 
any parent organization.  for that reason, sfra is solely dependent upon generous public donations through paypal, direct 
donations or donations of gift cards to pet stores for goods and food, fundraisers through gift shoppe purchases, ebay 
auctions, and those attending our annual fundraiser, midwest schnauzerfest (september 2008).  soâ¦sit back and visit us 
oftenâ¦.see whoâs available for adoption, whoâs been adopted, and see some of our successes.  weâre pawsitive youâll like 
what you see! 




7 ways to make the holidays safer for pets

nothing can spoil holiday cheer like an emergency visit to a veterinary clinic. these seven tips can help prevent a holiday disaster with your pets.


■
keep people food out of the reach of your pet, and ask your guests to do the same.


■
make sure your pet doesn't have any access to treats, especially those containing chocolate, xylitol, grapes/raisins, onions or other toxic foods.


■
don't leave your pet alone in the room with lit candles, a decorated tree or potpourri.


■
keep holiday plants (especially holly, mistletoe and lillies) out of reach of pets.


■
consider leaving the tinsel off your tree if you have a cat.


■
secure your christmas tree to keep it from falling over if your dog bumps it or your cat climbs it. hanging lemon-scented car air fresheners in the tree may deter your cat from climbing it.


■
provide a safe place for your pet to escape the excitement (such as a kennel, crate, perching place, scratching post shelf or hiding place) if youâre entertaining guests. if your pet is excitable or scared, consider putting your pet in another room with some toys and a comfortable bed.
