a model for experiential learning













 the hrdq experiential learning model explains the power of hrdq products to deliver on our promise of...better learning. better performance. better life.our tools don't place learners in a passive environment where they simply listen to someone describe how something should be done. instead, we engage learners in situations where they discover the value of a skill for themselves and then practice it. this is a better learning method, which boosts the learner's self-confidence to use and refine a skill in the real world. they've been there, done that, and they know they can do it again. 








this increases the odds that training will transfer from the learning environment to the workplace, where it really counts, where participants can apply what they have learned in a way that leads to better performance, which translates to a higher likelihood of professional and personal success. we aren't referring only to higher salaries, promotions, and status, though all of those certainly matter. we mean simply this: any activity, task, or job is far more rewarding when you can perform it skillfully. life is better when you do things well.








our qrew
our team is small but mighty. dedication, hard work, and creativity is the nature â and strength â of the hrdq qrew. from our research-based development and award-winning products, to our innovative online services and exemplary customer service â it's clear that we love what we do, and we love working together to do it. no one here is just their title. we all wear different hats on different days because we know it takes a committed and confident team to get the job done right. get to know our qrew!
