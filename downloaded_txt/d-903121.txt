our reviews










"let me start by saying “thank you guys for being so welcoming!” we just moved into our new home & attended our 1st client appreciation meet. the team was personable, caring and listened. i love the fact they include the community, kids esp & show us appreciation by these cute events they host. not alot of hoas are like that so i’m definitely glad we have byers & harvey to be there for us esp being new here & making us feel welcomed. i have confidence if my family needs something in regard to our home/neighborhood they will be there! i love people with a great vibe & this team has that."
- ciara f.






“the maintenance crew was very respectful and completely professional! the end result was better than the original construction and preserved the integrity of the house. b&h maintenance kept us apprised the entire time! well done all!!"
- gary c.






"i moved from out of town and the people i worked with in getting a place before arriving were all so nice. there was a bit of a hiccup with the first place i rented when i first got here, and i did have to stay in a hotel over the weekend while waiting for everything to open back up on that following monday. everyone at the office rallied together to make the situation right and (i apologize if i misspell any names) rubina, alicia, ginger, tiff, the two ladies at the front desk who i did not get the names of - they all were so nice and kind to me and in the end i am so happy with the place i am in now. so far a rocky start but the problem solving and teamwork that these ladies executed delighted me!"
- lori t.






"i am now in my 2nd residence with b&h, and i have to say their people are very professional and dedicated. i am a recent amputee and they have done everything in their power to accommodate my situation. i'm very grateful to their staff (especially maintenance) and appreciate all their efforts."
- laura p.






"bradley was awesome to work with when we bought our house and even kept in touch after we moved in to ensure everything was going smoothly. we were unable to make it to clarksville to look at the house in person prior to purchase. bradley gave us a thorough video walk through and personally inspected the property for us to make sure everything was perfect. 100% recommend."
- kyle b.






"rented a property from them for almost 2 years. was an older property that the owner didn't care to update but buyers and harvey still maintained it well. upon doing the final walk through robina helped us and even cleaned a section of our return vent that we overlooked, and in doing so saved us on some of our deposit. overall great experience."
- walt






"love byers & harvey! did a lease take over back in june and it was a simple process. everything was did online/email. their online portal for payments and maintenance is very easy to navigate."
- haley g.






"the staff has been so helpful making the transition of them taking over my property smooth! taylor lin went straight to work monday morning to answer all of my questions i had over the weekend. i appreciate how quick she replies and that she was able to advocate for us to get the best solution! kristen has also been so helpful as well as the sweet lady who answered the phone (elsye, i believe was her name). companies often get loaded with bad reviews over stuff they cannot always control but my personal expierence has been very positive!"
- jasmine c.






"the team at byers & harvey were great to deal with, and had great communications throughout the whole process. they made my moving experience as enjoyable as moving can be!"
- ron t.






"highly recommend this company! as a service vendor in the community, i know they take great care of their tenants. holly who works in the property management department has also been so incredibly kind and informative!"
- shawna h.






"this company is awesome! when i first came to them i had no rental history and just needed someone to give me a chance. my experience going in was super easy and straight forward, and i was given a ton of apartments & houses to choose from.  now i have been here a year and i am still just as happy. any repair that has been needed they have always responded and sent someone over quickly. all of the staff are super friendly. hands down my best experience with a rental."
- echo f.






"alyssa and josh were both behind amazing !! it was hard for me to find a house and they never gave up on me. they kept looking and never seemed to be annoyed with all my questions and emails (i was very annoying). they genuinely love to help people and i would refer them 1000 times to anyone !!"
- elyssia m.






"very nice building, they have many departments. i've not encountered any issues with their hoa department and they are really fair on expectations. i went here to pickup the keys for my mailbox."
- richard c.






"been renting from byers & harvey going on 2 years and have loved it. anytime we have had any house issues they are on it quickly and are so helpful!! thank you for providing great rental services!!"
- raven s.






"i liked  that it was a straight forward process. everyone was nice and extremely helpful especially since i was moving from another city. they minimized the amount of driving i thought i was going do."
- dragon m.






"christie miller has been such a great help while i have been living at my apartment complex.  she listens to the issues if there are any and is very informative. she works with you to fined a solution and doesn't treat you as just another $$ renting a unit. glad to have a good property manager on our side! thank you!"
