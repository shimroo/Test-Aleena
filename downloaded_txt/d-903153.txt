here's local beatlemaniac and all around great radio host and friend 
            mike west (host of kzok's "breakfast with the beatles"):
"this past friday i went to the historic everett theater to see the band 'wingsnthings' perform the entire wings kingdome performance that happened 40 years ago to the day. 
              my quick review: man... wingsnthings... we gave away tickets to this show and i wish everyone could've gone. they did an epic job doing the entire show from their spot-on musicianship to the actual horn section to the lasers and the smoke and the whole thing, it was just a flashback. it was like going back in time and these guys are awesome. 
so if you've never seen wingsnthings before, i am officially endorsing them now. i highly recommend that you see them."
              (hear mike's endorsement) listen to mike's show "breakfast with the beatles" on kzok 102.5 fm every sunday at 8am!

wingsnthings is...





marc montagnino: drums, vocals

 marc has been involved in the seattle music scene for  over 20 years, contributing his drumming and vocal talents towards a  multitude of local bands and music projects, including beyond the fringe, max  axle and tony la stella's wise guys. his ability to play a wide  variety of drumming styles as well as his eclectic combination of powerful  precision, vocal abilities and stage presence has earned marc a successful  place in the local music industry as one of puget sound's most versatile and  talented drummers. marc brings his own unique talents and his excitement for  paul mccartney's music to wingsnthings. marc and bryan had always wanted to play together but had a difficult time getting their schedules to coincide. together, they  conceived  the wingsnthings project and proceeded to recruit each of the other members to make sure that it  was the best live band it could be.


bryan woolley: lead vocals, electric &  acoustic guitars, piano, mandolin

      bryan  has been a fixture in seattle bands for most of his life and has for the past  17 years been the lead singer and front man of the popular  casino/corporate/club/festival band the machine. always a  beatle/mccartney nut, he jumped at the chance to play in wingsnthings when marc  montagnino approached him about the concept. along with co-lead vocalist arny  bailey, bryan  fronts wingsnthings: the music of paul mccartney and also borrowed time: the music of styx. he is also rumored to have some involvement with third stage: a tribute to boston, but these rumors can neither be confirmed nor denied. between he and  arny, they keep things fun for the band and audience. 



arny bailey: lead vocals, bass, ukulele

  arny cut his vocal chops on everything from early country to led  zeppelin. his  seemingly limitless vocal range and multi-instrumentalist  abilities have allowed him to play when and  where he'd like. while continuing to front about face and the rockafellers (and  sitting in with whoever needs a hired gun), arny used his vocal and guitar  skills with the grand delusion (styx tribute) and highway run (journey tribute)  a few years ago. after those two bands folded, arny created another styx project (borrowed  time: the music of styx),  and is currently that bandâs guitarist and co-lead vocalist with bryan woolley. 


ron smevik: lead guitar, vocals

    ron performed for  10 years in the duo known as samân ella, before forming the gourmet classic  rock band the rockafellers in 2003. the rockafellers specialized in performing  âthe wallâ by pink floyd and performed at many outdoor concerts in the seattle area.â  a âwingsâ fan for life, ron revels in  bringing the guitar stylings of jimmy mcculloch to a new generation of fans.


david shore: keyboards,percussion, vocals

    welcome back david! david shore is  a multi-keyboardist, sequencing artist, and vocalist. born & raised in seattle, david's expertise includes  national and international entertainment as well as many local bands in the  pacific northwest. groups like tour de’ force, bush patrol, hip city, chris  ward and plan b, and the penquins round out his creative resume'. david's ability to reproduce the keyboard parts and orchestration found in mccartney's vast song catalog is nothing short of amazing.
