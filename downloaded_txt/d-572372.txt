stavin is committed to enhancing
												winemaking through the use of innovative technologies and superior oak
												integration systems. as part of stavin's cost-effective approach, dr. jeff
												mccord (stavin's director of research) developed a system for replicating the
												micro-oxygenation of a barrel within tanks. while micro-oxygenation is
												not new, the development of the oxbox enables winemakers to easily integrate
												this successful method for enhancing wine during fermentation and aging in the
												controlled environment of a tank. using the oxbox in conjunction with
												stavin's oak integration systems provides discriminating winemakers with an
												unparalleled opportunity to maximize their wine's potential. 
                        learn more about stavin's oak infusion systems for tanks.
 methods of tannin management, color
												enhancement and stabilization, and palate development of red wine are discussed
												in stavin's book enhancement of red wine fermentation & aging.



we have also
											provided a pdf of the contents of this website -download as a single document.
