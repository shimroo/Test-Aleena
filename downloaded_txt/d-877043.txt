keltruck long service scania factory visit! 🕰️

last week keltruck directors tracey joynes and dave morgan hosted members of the keltruck family celebrating 30+ years of service on the adventure of a lifetime. 

to celebrate these staff members long service and commitment to keltruck, they were taken on a 2 day trip to the homeland of scania in sodertalje, sweden 🇸🇪

on the trip the team had the full scania experience including an evening tour at the infamous marcus wallenberg hall, a tour around the impressive scania factory, and a driving experience at the scania demo centre. 

at the demo centre the team were excited to hop into a wide selection of vehicles available from tippers, to v8's all the way to a range of electric vehicles which for most of our guests was their first time driving one! ⚡

to all our valued staff members who have served keltruck for 30+ years we would like to say a massive thank you for your continued loyalty and dedication.

swapping trucks for karts... only for an afternoon though!

we welcomed our apprentices from across the keltruck scania network, to come together for a celebration of their achievements this past year at the keltruck apprentice day 2024.

apprentices were treated to a company presentation, delivered by head of resource development, rob powell. and given the opportunity to meet the senior management team at keltruck, including sales director, david morgan and finance director, tracey joynes. who handed out our core value awards of care, integrity, dependability and professionalism for 2024.

after a tour of head office, apprentices then went to take part in an afternoon of pedal-to-the-metal action at a go-karting session, to bring the day to a close.

thank you to everyone who came along to make the keltruck apprentice day 2024, such a special event. we hope you enjoyed your day!4 months ago

                    scania has supplied thousands of engines for defence-related products since the 1990s. with recent geopolitical developments affecting global security, scania is experiencing a significant increase in demand for power solutions to build resilient defences.
