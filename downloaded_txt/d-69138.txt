brenda fucked my man
she fucked mine too!
who's your man?
jayvon- i'll kick her ass
i'm gonna kick your ass-jayvon's my man's name!!!!!
this last has to be from brenda herself:

and under that:
and now i'm fuckin him! trish
and finally:
jokes on all of you- he gave my clamidia!!! betsie
betsie was the only female bouncer in the place, and everyone was scared of her â€” so they barred jayvon (who really was sleeping with half of the dancers) and all stripped happily ever after!

sportsmans' park restrooms
idaho falls, id 83404
men's restroom, 1st floor
for a good conversation, meet here at 2:50pm on july 10.
look for a maroon van.
known locally as "peter park" because the homosexual perverts (not to say all homosexuals are perverts, just the twisted, child molesting ones) like to meet there, i found myself in that bathroom, on that day, at 2:47 pm.  i cannot describe the abject horror i felt.  i peed on myself in my haste to exit the bathroom, and sure enough, a maroon minivan pulled up at 2:49 and a suspicious pervert got out and checked the bathroom.  if you have ever seen dumb and dumber, you can't even imagine the terror of the truckstop bathrooom scene.

my copy of "how to serve man" is missing. has anyone seen it? jen
this was found just after a meeting of science fiction geeks had left. there is a story that boils down to this: aliens show up, end all wars, make everyone healthy and strong. someone notices a book all of the aliens carry and asks what it is, hears "how to serve man" and asks for translated copy. turns out to be a cookbook.

written in a red sharpie:
"god is dead" - fred
written in a black sharpie:
fred is dead,....god!
probably means an atheist with no invisable [sic] means of support. :-)
my guess is that it don't pay to piss off god in the urinal.
[note from a stall visitor: "fred" is referring to frederick nieztche, the philosopher, who said, "god is dead."]
