little
  red cap simply rolls on then off to provide a clean, easy solution to capping
 containers of caulk, paint, sealer, glue, chalk or anything on your shelf
 that you wish to reseal and reuse.  little red cap  replaces that rusting nail
 or screw youve always used to reseal caulk tubes.  it also replaces
 those lost or leaking caps that allow glue or chalk to spill in your tool
 kit or on your workbench.  little red cap  comes in packages of 16 or 35
 reusable caps to provide a convenient, clean, flexible solution to all of
 your cap requirements. look at the
  many
 other practical uses   for  little red cap.
