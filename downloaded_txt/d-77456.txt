are you ready to experience the world of clowning?



the peachtree clown alley is atlanta’s oldest clowning organization.
we are a not-for-profit group of clowns of all ages and walks of life. our mission is to promote clowning and clown knowledge, and to spread happiness and joy to audiences of all ages within the greater atlanta area.
our clowns volunteer and perform for non-profits and charity events, and we offer educational opportunities for aspiring clowns and experienced clowns wishing to improve their craft.
if you would like to find out more about adding the magic only clowns can bring to your upcoming event or experiencing the joy of becoming a clown yourself, please follow the links below.
