riverbend festival is on hiatus for 2024.like other independently owned and operated music festivals across the nation that are going on a temporary pause, riverbend is reevaluating and restructuring in order to be successful in the future.we are so incredibly thankful for 40 amazing years of riverbend and for the unwavering support from our community. the future holds lots of possibilities, and we hope to return stronger than ever!we'll see you soon.
















40 years of riverbend festivalwe are proud of our long-standing history in downtown chattanooga. riverbend started in 1982 at ross’s landing at a time when most of the buildings were boarded up, and few had reason to come to the riverfront. riverbend ignited civic pride, stimulated business and civic leaders to rethink downtown, and showcased the arts. riverbend ranks in the top 10% of all music festivals, increases chattanooga-hamilton county tax collections by $800,000, and it provides over $20 million in economic impact. the most important impact riverbend makes is the same one that made it so special in 1982: bringing people together from diverse backgrounds from around the country and the world to enjoy music in a special place that holds so much of chattanooga’s history.  here’s to 40 amazing years! thanks for an amazing 2023 festival!
