bob came to use from 1993 - 1995 he increased our programming by 8,900% by increasing the number of players from 10 kids to 900 players in under 2 years.  bob has a special way of attracting kids into programming. ~ ramon llano sportica ice rink











chuck watson - owner houston aerodromes
in 1997, rob promised us a 50% increase in programming, and i told him that since we have opened, we have never had that type of growth and the most we ever had was 33%.  rob did not increase our programming by 50%, he increased our programming by 88%, the best we ever had!  ~  chuck watson - aerodrome ice rinks.

building revenue streams for rink owners















the first thing we do when we come into your facility is doing a 20-point inspection of the surroundings and programming.  we talk with your clients to give us feedback on their experience at your facility.  the 20-point inspection gives us a full picture of the revenue streams we can implement for you right away.when we come into your facility, we also conduct a market survey which will help us understand the growth opportunities within your area. after the survey, we sit down with you and provide you with our findings, in which we give you a step-by-step analysis of the various 30 revenue streams we can provide for you.
















one program that we will provide you is our online coaching support program.  this program comes with unlimited use of all the hundreds of coaching drills we have on our site, and all of the coaching technical manuals that we have developed over the last 40 years, from player/parent manuals to predesign 36-week practice plans.  this 36-week coaching practice plan is laid out in a progression that starts with an easy workout to a more advanced practice as the program advances each week. we will provide a practice plan for coaches to use to add their own drills into their training if they so desire.
