our story
when frank sauder started selling the freshest vegetables, poultry, and eggs from lancaster, pa farms to residents and businesses located in philadelphia during the great depression in the 1930s, no one knew what the future held. sauder quickly built a solid reputation for quality foodstuff and fair prices. constantly building on that reputation, sauder’s door-to-door egg business has grown into one of the nation’s top egg wholesaling businesses over the years.
since the company’s humble beginnings r.w. sauder has expanded from one location in brownstown, pa to five grading and processing facilities located in three states. today, the organization employs about 400 people and sells approximately 1.5 billion eggs annually.

just as many people like the family-orientation our operation has, you’re sure to appreciate the variety of egg products we offer. when you buy eggs from sauder’s, it’s all about variety, quality, hen husbandry, integrity and excellence. and these things certainly show in the products that bear the sauder name.
here are the egg products we’re proud to sell under our family name:
sauder’s traditional white & brown eggs:
since sauder’s humble beginnings back in the 1930s, our traditional white eggs have remained best-selling products. we source our sauder’s grade a large eggs directly from amish country and sell them by the dozen, with each egg having only 70 to 80 calories.
plus, we mark every sauder’s grade a large egg with a freshness and farm traceability code printed on its shell. you can enter the three-digit farm code on our website to learn the specific farm that produced your eggs. this traceability is just one way we invite you to look inside our business and feel like you’re a part of our family.






 
sauder’s organic eggs:
in the past decade or so, the demand for organic eggs has increased greatly. our organic eggs come from chickens that eat a special diet and enjoy the freedom to wander around their hen houses, as well as outside on the grass. all our organic eggs also have 200mg of omega.
sauder’s white & brown cage free eggs:
cage-free chickens are raised in a stress-free environment and are not in cages but free to roam. they are kept in large heated and air-cooled growing houses with no outdoor access, where they can roost and socialize freely, participating in their chicken behaviors and pecking orders, have areas to exhibit natural behaviors, and laying their eggs in dark, quiet nests.
sauder’s hard cooked flavored eggs:
are you looking for a mouth-watering alternative to your usual snacks? if so, sauder’s hard boiled flavored eggs are a great, flavor-filled choice. our versatile hard cooked flavored eggs are also a tasty addition to salads and a wide assortment of side dishes. sauder’s hard boiled flavored eggs are available in three flavors: original, red beet and buffalo hot.












sauder’s pasture raised eggs:
what makes eggs pasture-raised is simple—the fact that hens have access to outdoors, sun light on regular basis.
even though modern chickens have evolved from their ancestral cousins over the years, hens are still near-insatiable omnivores. if they lived in the wild, chickens would still eat almost any food they had access to. when chickens are raised on pasture, their experience closely mimics how they’d live in the wild–and their diet reflects it.
in addition to being fed a diet of sauder’s gold feed, rich in lutein, omega-3 and vitamin d; pasture-raised hens also enjoy the outdoors as they feed on natural grass, seeds and insects. in general, pasture-raised eggs are laid by chickens that enjoy an outdoor lifestyle that’s cleaner and less stressful than alternative environments. these hens also enjoy plenty of fresh air and exposure to the sun.

our farmers
family-owned and operated since it was founded, r.w. sauder is now run by president and ceo mark sauder, the fourth-generation sauder to occupy the organization’s top position. just like sauder’s eggs and the other divisions that make up r.w. sauder are family-owned, so are the farms the company does business with.
sauder’s eggs works with more than 104 farmers who have more than six and a half million hens producing eggs for sauder. the profile of a typical farm that partners with sauder’s eggs is a small, family-run farm that operates with one farmer, his or her children and an employee or two.
with grocery stores having grown so dramatically over the past quarter-century, many of the farms that provide eggs to sauder wouldn’t be able to keep up with demand on their own. by partnering with r.w. sauder, the egg supplies from multiple farms are pooled together, which enables sauder’s eggs to satisfy the demands of retailers, such as trader joe’s, weis markets, aldi and sam’s club.
when you buy eggs from sauder’s, you can rest assured you’re purchasing eggs that have gone directly from one family to another to yours. is there anything better than that?
