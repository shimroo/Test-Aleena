what is fiscal sponsorship?a formal arrangement in which a nonprofit organization (ppf) agrees to support a project or initiative that lacks its own tax-exempt status (your project). this relationship allows the sponsored project to operate under the fiscal sponsor’s tax-exempt status, enabling it to receive tax-deductible donations and grants that would otherwise only be accessible to recognized nonprofit organizations.
