publishers of fine books for the gun collector 






does this rear sight belong on a .45-70 springfield trapdoor carbine with this serial number? 
answer: no, it does not. it was installed on original carbines between serial numbers 85,000 to 99,000. if you did not know that, you might need the .45-70 springfield book.


which rear sight was used on an m1 carbine made in march 1943? if you picked the top one, you are incorrect. 
answer: the bottom sight was in use until mid-1944, the top sight after early 1945. if you did not know, you might need the m1 carbine, wartime production book.


the m1 garand used nine variations of stocks. this type of stock was manufactured by whom and used in what serial number range?
answer: springfield armory between s/n 80,001-950,000 and winchester arms between s/n 2,305,850 to end of production. if you did not know that, then you might need the m1 garand 1936 to 1957 book. 


the wwii model1903a4 sniper rifle used a specific telescopic sight. which of these two is the real sniper scope for this rifle? 
answer:the top one. the m73b1 was based on the weaver 330-c telescopic sight. the bottom scope is the weaver 330-s which did not have “click” stops on the elevation and windage knobs. the 330-s was never acquired by the u.s. military for the model 1903a4 sniper rifle. examine the adjusting knobs carefully. if you did not know that, you might need collecting the american sniper rifle 1900 to 1945.

collecting the american sniper rifle
1900 to 1945
by joe poyer
a quick search of ebay for anything related to sniper rifles—telescopic sights, mounts, manuals, cases, etc.—illustrates the collecting "frenzy" for sniper rifles, both old and new.

weaver telescopic sights used on the world war ii-era model 1903a4 sniper rifles sell for $900 to $1,500 dollars, only most of those offered for sale are fakes or are misrepresented commercial sights. the "chat rooms" are full of misinformation because there is very little reference material available.

collecting the american sniper rifle, 1900 to 1945 provides accurate information that will allow the collector to determine whether or not a particular rifle or telescopic part—or other accessory—is correct.
the book provides a detailed description of...


the sniper rifle with all parts and markings that make it uniquely a u.s. military sniper rifle.


the telescopic sight with all parts and markings that make it uniquely a u.s. military sniper scope.


the bases and mounts with all parts and markings that make them part of the u.s. military sniper scope assembly.


the books also contains a history of the development of each particular sniper rifle and telescopic sight. its mounting on the rifle and sighting in are described in detail. a history of the development of the rifle leading to its use as a sniper rifle is included in an appendix, as are descriptions of british and canadian sniper rifles that used american-produced telescopic sights.
this book covers the sniper variations of the model 1903 springfield:

u.s. model 1903 .30 caliber rifle with the warner & swasey telescopic sight
u.s. model 1903 .30 caliber rifle with the winchester a5 or lyman 5a

telescopic sight:

model 1903a1 (sniper) u.s.m.c. rifle with the 7.8x unertl telescopic sight
model 1903a4 .30 caliber (snipers) rifle with the weaver m73b1 telescopic sight.

this book does not contain sniping techniques or tactics. those have been well-described in other books.

collecting the american sniper rifle
1945 to 2000 
by joe poyer
this volume in the “collecting the american sniper rifle” series includes the m1c and m1d garand sniper rifles, the winchester and remington match rifles used as sniper rifles in vietnam, the usmc m40 sniper rifle, the us army’s m24 and xm2010 sniper rifles, the special operations command m86 and m89 sniper rifles, and the t3 and m2 carbines equipped with the t120, m1, m2 and m3 infrared sniperscopes.
each sniper rifle is analyzed in depth for serial number ranges, markings, parts codes and other identifying markings. the telescopic sights, mounts, and rings are specifically identified for their military use complete with markings and where useful, serial number ranges.
you find an m1c or m1d sniper rifle at a gun show or a gun shop? how do you know that it is an original and authentic u.s. military sniper rifle. these and other u.s. military sniper rifles have been counterfeited for several decades now. others have been built by well-meaning shooters and collectors for their own use, but over the years, and in other hands, they have become “original and authentic” sniper rifles.
m1cs fall into a distinct range of serial numbers and their telescopic sights and mountings possess distinct characteristics. do you know what they are?
the m1d, the most popular u.s. military snipers rifle to collect, are widely faked. do you know how to identify a correct m1d. producing an m1d only requires a change to the barrel and a new handguard. the mount and bracket to the telescopic sights have been widely manufactured for more than thirty years as after-market replacements. original m84 telescopic sights and their mounting are identified, photographed and compared to after-market reproductions.
telescopic sights for the m1903a4, m1c, m1d and m40 sniper rifles are now being reproduced in china for sale in the united states. none of them say “made in china.” often they are sold on ebay and other auction sites, either reworked to appear original, or without stating that they are reproductions. do you know how to tell the difference?
there are a few original usmc m40 and the m24 sniper rifles that have been released for sale to police departments and to civilians. but the have also been reproduced by numerous gunsmiths and small companies for the past twenty or so years. most of the shipping boxes made it plain that these were not the real thing, but once the box is lost, or the rifle on a table at a gun show, or listed on a gun auction site, how do you tell a reproduction from the original?
collecting the american sniper rifle 1945-2000, like its predecessor, collecting the american sniper rifle 1900 to 1945, provides detailed descriptions and tables of identifying characteristics. if you are interested in collecting american sniper rifles, these are the books you need. they may save you hundreds of dollars and a lot of grief.

all military and commercial markings are listed by date or serial number range of use. serial numbers are listed in twenty-six individual tables both by military and the individual commercial models, and by other manufacturers. an appendix contains a serial number listing organized both by manufacturing and shipping date. serial numbers for british military, canadian, argentine, norwegian, and russian military pistols are also given.
individual chapters and appendices provide detailed examinations of markings on receivers, slides and barrels, including military inspection and commercial markings, and photographs of all slide markings. finishes are discussed for both military and commercial pistols by serial number ranges. accoutrements and accessories are thoroughly explored and photographed including all belts, magazine pockets, and holsters .
a complete listing of all u.s. military model 1912, 1916, m3, m7, and m15 holster manufacturers is included. u.s. military-issue ammunition in .45 acp is described in detail. a photo-illustrated assembly/disassembly procedure shows the most efficient way to service the pistol.

swiss magazine loading rifles 1869 to 1958
2nd edition, revised   
by joe poyer
vetterli and schmidt-rubin rifles and carbines
in 1869, the swiss government adopted the world's first successful magazine loading rifle for their army. in the latter half of the 19th century, prussia was the military power to be feared and the swiss, living right next door, were determined to guarantee the integrity of their borders.
the vetterli rifle was a clever swiss design that combined the spring-loaded magazine tube and cartridge elevator of the winchester model 1866 and the bolt action of the dreyse needle-fire rifle. it provided the swiss infantryman with eleven shots as fast as he could work the bolt.
by the end of the 1880s, the vetterli had been made obsolete by the march of technology. a new rifle design using a straight pull system was developed. the model 1889 underwent major redesigns ending in the k-31, one of the finest, most accurate bolt action infantry rifles ever developed. the promise of the magazine loading rifle was fulfilled: the swiss were able to avoid invasion and involvement in two world wars and one cold one.
swiss magazine loading rifles, 1869 to 1958 by joe poyer is the newest book in the "for collectors only" series. it describes, on a part-by-part basis, all the models of both the vetterli and schmidt-rubin rifles including infantry rifles, short (stutzer) rifles, carbines and cadet models. all markings and codes are explained and tied to models and serial number ranges. also included are exploded views, ammunition details, assemble/disassembly instructions, maintenance and trouble shooting.
the swiss rifles are not only extremely accurate and a great deal of fun to shoot, but their wide range of variations makes them a great collectible.

the american krag rifle and carbine, 3rd edition, revised. 

by joe poyer, edited by craig riesch
the krag rifle and carbine were the first smokeless powder, magazine loading arms used by the united states army. it was adopted from a norwegian design in 1892 and reached the troops starting in mid-1894.
the krag was the first precision-machined, small caliber, magazine loading rifle adopted by the u.s. army. this meant that the production facilities and work force had to be completely rebuilt and reorganized. in just four short years, the entire u.s. army, both mounted and dismounted branches, were completely equipped with the new rifle and carbine. so successful had been the design and initial production phase, that only minor changes were made to the rifle and carbine afterward.
it was the ideal time to introduce a new rifle. the u.s. army in the 1890s was a peacetime organization. the frontier had been settled in the late 1880s and the army had been reduced in strength to not quite 18,000 strong, and was scattered halfway around the world from plattsburgh, new york to anchorage, alaska to honolulu, hawaii. all but two troops of cavalry were still stationed west of the mississippi river and no military formations in regimental strength had been assembled since the sioux wars in 1876-1877.
but the combination of spanish imperialism in cuba and the sinking of the battleship, uss maine, led the united states into a short, sharp war in 1898 that gave way to a longer, more bitter fight in the philippines. in 1900, chinese revolutionaries styled the "boxers" threatened to murder all foreigners in china. the u.s. army and marines brought their krag rifles to mainland china in concert with forces from other european nations and quickly relieved the siege of the foreign legations at peking and then helped clear the country of insurgents.
even though the krag only served the u.s. army for eleven years, it did so admirably and saw much hard fighting. it only gave way to the model 1903 springfield as the latter rifle could be loaded quickly and easily with a five round clip.
the american krag rifle and carbine provides the arms collector, historian and target shooter with a part-by-part analysis of what has been called the "rifle with the smoothest bolt action ever designed." each of the fifteen models of the american krag rifle and carbine are described in detail. all changes to all parts are described and matched to serial number ranges. a monthly serial number chart by production year has been devised that will provide the collector with the year and month in which his rifle or carbine was manufactured.
the mystery of the so-called philippine constabulary rifles is solved and the "school" rifle is introduced. a new and complete exploded view is included as are instructions for assembly and disassembly of the rifle and carbine.

the model 1903 springfield rifle and its variations
"4th edition, revised and expanded" 
by joe poyer edited by ed furler, jr.
the model 1903 springfield rifle was perhaps the most famous and popular of all u.s. military rifles. first issued in 1903, it served in two world wars and the korean war and numerous smaller military actions around the globe between in the first half of the 20th century. it even saw limited service during the war in vietnam. today, it is an extremely popular and sought-after military rifle by collectors. a modification of the famous mauser bolt action, the model 1903 springfield was legendary for its accuracy in the hands of a well-trained rifleman. a variation of the rifle developed especially for match shooting held the crown in the national matches longer than any other rifle. the national matches have been conducted annually on a nationwide basis since 1873 except in wartime and involved both civilian and military shooters competing on an equal basis. the matches exerted a great deal of influence on the design of american military rifles and marksmanship training.
"the model 1903 springfield rifle and its variations" provides a detailed examination of this famous military rifle on a part-by-part basis. every variation in every part is documented and matched to the serial number range of its use. thirty-one different variations of the rifle were developed over the 41 year course of its production and all are described and identified.
twelve different variations of the rifles were developed as sniper rifles beginning in 1907. all are discussed and described as are the telescopic sights used on each. the rifle was produced for civilian shooters by the springfield national armory as well. several variations of .30 caliber rifles were developed and sold through the director, civilian marksmanship program and the national rifle association for target shooting and hunting. a range of .22 caliber rimfire rifles was also developed for both low cost military and civilian marksmanship training in the 1920s and 1930s.
during world war ii, to meet the needs of a 12 million man military force, the remington arms company and the smith corona typewriter company produced more than 1.8 million model 1903a3 rifles including the remington-manufactured model 1903a4 sniper rifle.
appendices provide additional information on serial numbers, production numbers, ammunition, inspection procedures and markings, lists of military and civilian inspectors and their markings, the national match rifle and the rare and highly classified pedersen device that converted this bolt action rifle to a semiautomatic rifle during world war i with never-before published original factory photos. a thorough bibliography completes the text.
"the model 1903 springfield rifle and its variations" is 456 pages long with six color plates and hundreds of black and white drawings and photos. format is perfect bound, 8.5 x 5.5 inches. every part is illustrated in detail either in a drawing or photo. as the book covers the entire range of the model 1903 rifle from the rod bayonet to the m1903a4 sniper rifle. the retail price is $24.95 and as such, the book is a viable alternative to the $50 and $80 dollar books presently available on the springfield.
the model 1903 springfield and its variations "4th edition, revised and expanded" $24.95 ea. 
 



smle (no.1) rifles mk i and mk iii,
3rd edition revised  
by charles r. stratton
the british enfield no.1 rifle (mk i through lshapore 2a/2a1) is not only one of the world's finest battle rifles, but also one of the longest serving from africa's colonial wars through world wars i and ii and korea to the conflicts of the middle east. the british tommy and the troops of the former british commonwealth counted on their short magazine lee-enfields for nearly 90 years, and many are still in use today. skip stratton, who maintains the enfield rifle research internet web site and is a collector of long standing, has written a superb book that provides a well-organized, detailed look from the collector's perspective at this fine rifle series.
dozens of charts and illustrations take you through seven manufacturers on three continents and seventy years of production to identify each variation of every single part of the rifle. stratton shows you how to determine which parts are correct for each manufacturer and each period of manufacture. is that lee-enfield pre-world war i, world war i, world war ii, or post-world war ii manufacture? british or commonwealth? original or arsenal reconditioned? it takes more than the date on the action body to determine that. and what do all of those codes and inspection marks and cyphers mean? do they help detemine the age of the rifle and its parts? yes, they do, and all are listed in the books' 158 pages and shown in more than 90 illustrations and photographs. also included are descriptions of accoutrements, cleaning tools, and bayonets issued to the british and commonwealth soldier with his short magazine lee-enfield. serial numbers, codes, markings, cyphers - this book has it all in an easy-to-use layout.
british enfield rifles, smle(vol 1) mk i & miii   $19.95   



british enfield rifles volume 2, no. 4 and no. 5 rifles, 3rd edition revised   
by charles r. stratton

charles (skip) stratton, has done an outstanding job- again. he presents the no. 4 and no. 5 rifle part-by-part. every single model, including the sniper rifles, target and match rifles and training rifles, manufactured in the u.k., canada, the u.s., republic of south africa and pakistan, is thoroughly described.

he begins by presenting the historical background for the development of both rifles, the no. 4 in the dark, early days of world war ii and the no. 5 (better known as the jungle carbine) prompted by the ferocious fighting in malaya and burma. he describes each variation of both rifles and explains what all the "marks," "numbers," and codes found on most parts mean and shows how to relate them to the various manufacturing factories in england, canada, the united states, south africa and pakistan. he also provides a breakdown of serial numbers by year, factory and country.

stratton then literally dissects both rifles, describing every single part and explaining the reasons behind any changes and points out how to identify those changes.

for instance, there are eight different receivers - action bodies- used on the eleven variations of both rifles, five variations of breech bolts, nine variations of rear sights, thirteen variations of barrels and two variations of stocks. stratton also discusses every single part of the rifle in the same detail so that the reader and collector knows that there are three variations of the humble stock bolt, seven variations of the forend, three variations of the buttplate, and so on, as well as how to identify each and relate it to a specific range of serial numbers produced by a specific factory.

the book also translates the codes and markings that often pinpoint its original and subsequent military units. collectors are thrilled when the discover that their rifle served at el alamein or during the invasion of sicily, at monte cassino, normandy or in the far east in malaya, or in korea or aden or anywhere else british forces were to be found between 1941 and the mid-1950s.

as with his first volume covering the mk i and mk iii (no. 1) rifles, this is a thorough and well-organized book that will aid the collector in determining originality and restoring these historical battle rifles to authenticity.

new! british enfield rifles, volume 4, the pattern 1914 and u.s. model of 1917 rifles   
by charles r. stratton
charles r. stratton continues his very successful series on collectible british military rifles with the little understood, but widely available pattern 1914 and u.s. model of 1917 rifles.
often called the "american enfield," the pattern 1914 in .303 caliber was the only british military rifle ever built wholly in the united states even though it was designed by the engineers at enfield arsenal. the u.s. model 1917 was the same rifle, but rechambered for the american .30-06 cartridge. over 1.2 million pattern 1914 rifles and 2.5 million model 1917 rifles were built during world war i by three american companies, winchester, remington and eddystone. more american soldiers, including sergeant alvin york, were armed with the model 1917 enfield than with the model 1903 springfield.
the model 1917 enfield has long been a favorite american collectible. over the years, it has been sporterized for hunting and restored for collecting by thousands of shooters. parts are commonly available and many p-14 parts are interchangeable with m1917 parts, making it quite easy to return a given rifle to original condition.
as in the previous two volumes, mr. stratton has provided a detailed description of each rifle on a part by part basis and noted whether or not the particular part is interchangeable between the two models. he provides a series of charts and explanations for the markings, codes and inspection stamps that appear on each part and tells how to determine which were originally manufactured for the p-14 or the m1917. he also provides a complete history of the rifle's development and use in both world war i and world war ii. also a complete description of the two sniper rifle variations of the p-14 that were fielded in both wars, the pedersen device developed for the m1917, and the accessories that were issued with the rifle to soldiers of both countries, including ammunition belts, bayonets, tools and cleaning equipment. separate appendixes provide an exploded view and nomenclature, production statistics, ammunition descriptions and sporting rifle derivations.
the demand for this book has been so great that the author and publisher decided to skip over volume 3 in the series which will deal with the original "long lee" rifle for the time being. volume 4, the pattern 1914 and u.s. model of 1917 rifles is being published out of sequenc to meet this demand. isbn 1-882391-29-2, 5.5 x 8.5 inches, perfect bound.

by joe poyer.
the m16 has been the nation's military rifle since 1964, longer than any other military rifle. during those 36 years, it has been carried in combat and on peacekeeping missions by american, allied and friendly soldiers to every corner of the world.over thirty new pages added to this edition with up-to date information on the latest military developments in the m4, m16a3 and -a4, and m25 models, designated markman’s rifles, .22 caliber tactical rifles, and all new calibers in which the ar15s are chambered.)
the civilian version, the ar15 rifle, has been manufactured in the hundreds of thousands by more than a dozen different companies. it is the current national match service rifle and the most popular target match rifle in use today.
the m16/ar15 rifles by joe poyer provides a detailed examination of this famous rifle in both its military and civilian versions. following a history of its development and the evolution of military tactics that guided its design, a comprehensive part-by-part examination of the rifle is provided.
markings and codes for military and civilian rifles and carbines are deciphered and a six page table lists all models by all manufacturers currently in production, with specific features.
for those interested in competition, three ar15s were custom-built; a spacegun for long range bench rest matches, a service match rifle that complies with all current ocm and nra competition rules and a .22 rimfire ar15 rifle that is not only amazingly accurate but is legal in california and other states that ban large capacity magazine, centerfire, semiautomatic rifles. the design and building process is thoroughly described for those wishing to build their own match rifles.
the m16/ar15 rifle is the last military rifle that americans will be allowed to own. the m16's replacement, which incorporates a 20 mm grenade launcher, is already well-advanced in testing and is due to be introduced by mid-decade. but the ar15 rifle will remain the national match service rifle far into the foreseeable future.
the book is illustrated with over three hundred photos and drawings, is 8 x 10.5 inches in size, perfect bound and 134 pages in length.

 the m1911 complete owners guide, volume 1,"
by walt kuleck
walt kuleck has done it again. his “complete owner’s guides” (m1 garand, m1 carbine, m14 and ar15) are the last word on the care and preservation of collectible firearms. his new book for the model 1911 covers every aspect of caring for the model 1911 and model — and all the information applies to every other model 1911­style pistol by colt or any other manufacturer — from problems with safeties to failures to feed to broken grip screw bushings. virtually every problem that can occur with the model 1911­type pistol is covered and walt offers immediate fixes that most everyone can handle. he also provides tips on such problems as a small but growing crack in the receiver that does not yet interfere with the function or safety of the pistol: solution, in most cases it can be fixed by drilling a tiny hole at the end of the crack to prevent it growing further. he discusses magazines and how to determine a good one from a bad one before purchasing; how to deal with springs that have lost their tension, how to select a slide stop that fits the shooter’s hand, and a hundred an one more problems. additional chapters include “magazine, up grade, holsters, ammunition, and shooting (including a section entitled “how to win a gunfight”). a highly recommended text for the shooter and collector.

 ­­­the m1911 complete assembly guide, volume 2,"
by walt kuleck and drake oldham
everyone knows how to disassemble and reassemble a model 1911­type pistol. or think they do. when i had my own gun store some years back, i lost track of the number of john browning’s pistols that were brought to me in a box to put back together. and even those who may know how, seldom do it properly and the result is a collection of ill­fitting parts that wear faster than they should and malfunction far to often. the m1911 complete assembly guide not only teaches the correct way to disassemble and reassemble any model 1911, but how to improve the old warhorse.

   thinking of repairing grandad’s world war ii remington rand or “customizing” your colt series 80? or perhaps you have a new pistol from one of the dozens of manufacturers now producing variations of the model 1911. or perhaps you are thinking of building one from scratch. if so, then walt kuleck and drake oldham, who between them have more than fifty years experience with building and caring for model 1911­type pistols for civilians and police forces, take you through the process step­by­step. like the m1911 complete owner’s guide, volume 1, volume 2 should be on the bookshelf of every professed model 1911 collector and shooter.

the mosin-nagant rifle, 6th revised and expanded edition   
by terence w. lapin
although the mosin-nagant rifle was in use for more than sixty years by half the world's military forces, no book in the english language has ever traced its development and identified all its models and variations as manufactured around the world, including in the united states. no provided the part-by-part information needed by the collector and shooter.
this is the first book in english, ever written about the mosin-nagant. it identifies every single model manufactured in russia, france, the united states, poland, romania, hungary, finland, china and north korea. every part is described with all changes and markings, making it possible to identify the national origins of not only the rifle as a whole, but of every part.
chapters provide a history of its development and use from 1892 to its last manufacture in hungary and china in the mid-1950s. then each part is analyzed showing all changes in chronological order. all variations are described from the original rifle to the m1944 carbine with its unique folding bayonet. all finnish variations are described and a history of the tiny country's relations with its giant next door neighbor is included to show the derivation of finland's line of mosin-nagants.
sniper rifles from all countries are listed in a separate chapter as is the ammunition produced for the rifle and all accessories issued to the combat soldier. of great value to the collector is the huge list of markings and codes found on all mosin-nagant rifles of whatever national origin, the first ever compiled.
the mosin-nagant was one of the earliest small-caliber battle rifles developed in the late 19th century. its rugged design and construction are borne out by the fact that the only changes ever made to its basic design were to shorten and lighten the rifle as ammunition improved and battle conditions changed. the mosin-nagant is without doubt, one of the premier battles rifles of the late 19th and early 20th century and a testament to skill of it russian designer.

by craig riesch.
the 7th edition of the best selling "bible" of the world war ii m1 carbine has been updated with new information from the previous edition. the changes between the 6th and 5th editions are listed on the last page of the book.

the author, craig riesch, has compiled twenty-two years of surveys and research into this 237 page volume containing 38 charts, 212 photographs, and fourteen drawings. the book provides a history of the m1 carbine's development, manufacture and use during world war ii, as well as through the korean war and the war in vietnam.

the m1 carbine is analyzed and described by its ten separate manufacturers and various models, with all changes, modifications, and new parts noted by  serial number range of use. and since the u.s. army ordnance department required that virtually every part of the m1 carbine be marked with a manufacturer's or subcontractor's code, riesch has unraveled the manufacturer's and subcontractor's codes---again by serial number range --- and eliminated many "spurious codes" and myths. every major and most minor parts are now conclusively identified by manufacturer and serial number range, making it possible for the collector, shooter, and historian to examine an m1 carbine to determine its authenticity with a high degree of confidence.

using the charts and photos in the book, the collector can identify the manufacturer and period of use for the receiver group, barrel group, trigger housing group, and stock group and their component parts. butt plates by the various manufacturers are shown in full-size photographs for easy identification.

all variations of the m1 carbine are discussed -- m1, m1a1, and m2 -- by manufacturer. the aspects that make up the two types of true m1a1 folding stock paratrooper carbines are described and photographed. serial number ranges for original manufacture are included. reproduction folding stocks are shown and points of difference are identified.

the book is divided into six chapters and ten appendices. each chapter describes a major subgroup of the m1 carbine: receiver, barrel, trigger assembly, and stock. chapter six covers the m1 carbine accessories issued to the soldier, and chapter seven the m3 trench knife and m4 bayonet, and their scabbards. the appendices include serial number sequences for each manufacturer, a description of the types of ammunition for the m1 carbine, a discussion of "imported" carbines, an exploded view, and an m1 carbine survey form on which the collector can list all parts of his or her carbine to determine authenticity. complete instructions for disassembling the carbine are included with photographs.

the sks carbine, revised and expanded 5th edition 
by steve kehaya and joe poyer. 

a complete analysis of the communist bloc's sks carbine -the first detailed study of this fine, collectible carbine in twenty-five years. every part analyzed to tell you how to determine its country of origin and whether or not those parts are compatible between sks carbines of different nation's manufacture.
this famed soviet-designed shoulder arm, which together with the ak-47, armed hundreds of thousands of "national liberation front" fighters from vietnam to angola. it was manufactured in six countries and its total production ran into the tens of millions. since 1986, over 1,000,000 of those albanian, russian, east german, chinese, north vietnamese, north korean, romanian and yugoslav sks carbines were imported into the united states. that vast number not only provides a fertile field for collectors, but helps keep prices low enough to make the sks carbine a fine plinking and hunting rifle. 
the sks carbine examines the firearm on a part-by-part basis so that you can determine 1) which parts are original on a particular sks carbine, 2) in which country they were produced, 3) which of those parts are interchangeable between different manufacturers and which are not, 4) how to read serial numbers to determine date of manufacture and country of origin, and 5) what the inspection markings stamped on metal and wood parts mean. since the vast majority of sks carbines in the u.s. are military surplus, you will learn how to examine and select a fine, shootable sks carbine. you are also provided with complete assembly/disassembly instructions, how to manufacture most parts if you cannot find a commercial source, and ammunition characteristics, and ballistic information.
an expanded list of factory codes for the chinese sks carbines has been made available to the authors by collector howard bearse. that information and more has also been included in this 5th revised and expanded edition of the sks carbine.

a guide book to u.s. army dress helmets 1872 to1904
 
mark kasal and don moore
in 1872, the franco-prussian war had recently ended leaving the new german nation the strongest military power on the continent. so impressed were the worlds military officials with the lightning-quick german military victory that almost overnight french influence on tactics and uniforms was replaced with a strong germanic flavor.
the united states army and its leaders were no exception. in the midst of developing and adopting a new uniform for officers and enlisted men, the prussian influence was most evident in the new dress helmet issued in 1871. it had a high crown with a rudimentary front brim and a sloping rear brim that quickly earned the nickname, lobstertail. it was crowned with a spike for foot troops or a horsehair plume for mounted men. it looked so much like a german dress helmet of the time that the u.s. army military attache to the american embassy in paris was booed on the streets by parisians who thought he was a german officer.
the m1872 dress helmet has intrigued collectors and military historians ever since. it was one of the most colorful dress helmets ever worn by american army troops. cavalry plumes and cords were a lemon yellow color and the plumes dangled well below the rear brim. a plaited cord was attached to the helmet and looped around the shoulders and chest to keep the helmet from being lost when mounted on horseback or in a high wind. artillery troops wore bright red cords and plumes or polished spikes and signal corps soldiers wore orange and white later, all black cords and plumes. even the corps of indian scouts had their own distinctive white and red cords and plumes.
in 1881, the height of the crown and the length of the rear brim were reduced to make the helmet more comfortable to wear. other branches and units of the army received permission to "customize" their helmets with their own distinctive insignia, expanding the variations available to the delight of collectors nearly a hundred years later.
the decorative helmets were worn by the u.s. army including such notables as george custer, john j. pershing, phil sheridan, james w forsyth, william t. sherman, alfred terry, ranald mckenzie, nelson miles and even tom mix til 1904 when they were replaced in that year by a flat, peaked cap and much of the pomp and color went out of the military.
a guide book to u.s. army dress helmets 1872 to 1904" describes both the model 1872 and model 1881 dress helmets in exhaustive detail. separate chapters describe reproduction helmets and helmet parts which have appeared over the past several decades and tells how to determine which parts are real and which are reproductions; also how to clean, restore and care for helmets and tips on finding collectable helmets and parts at shows and on the internet. numerous photos of helmets and helmet parts are included as are eight full pages of color plates showing correct enlisted and officers helmets for study. also included is an extensive gallery of period photographs showing the helmets as worn by troops of the time.

the mp38, 40, and 40/1 and 41 submachine gun
by g. de vries and b.j. martens.
the mp38/40 sub machine gun was often mistakenly called the "schmeisser" by g.i.s during world war ii. in actual fact, it was a product of heinrich vollmer's genius and it was developed and produced by the erma company. widely manufactured and issued on all fronts by german forces, it is almost as familar as the mauser rifle. it was the first submachine gun with a folding butt stock and no wood at all. it ran through three variations, each improving the weapon and easing production requirements. the fourth, the model 1941, combined the best attributes of hte mp28,ii and the mp40.
this book is written by g.de vries and b.j. martens, who also wrote the "k98k mauser." the book is also part of the special interest publications series and like the k98k book, not only provides a complete history of the submachine gun's development and use, but specialized information concerning markings and identification points of special interest to the collector.
the book is heavily illustrated with original world war ii photographs.

the ml garand complete assembly guide
by walt kuleck with clint mckee.
isbn # is 1-888722-13-4 
have you ever thought about turning that mismatched or imported beat-up old m1 garand into a tack-driving, accurized rifle, or even assembling a complete m1 garand from parts? receivers, barrels and plenty of g.i. parts are still around and at reasonable prices.
applying the same system of techniques that worked so well in  the ar15 complete assembly guide, this new book provides all the information you need to know on how to select parts - and where to find them - how to inspect each part, how to fit the bolt to the receiver using hand tools, how to fit a barrel to the receiver if you are somewhat handy with

tools - or how to have it done professionally to obtain the proper head space with a "stright up" barrel.

even if you don't plan to build an m1 garand from scratch, this book contains more than enough information to enable you to resolve virtually every problem you might encounter with an m1 garand.
in addition, the book presents a valuable guide to the proper assembly/disassembly procedure and maintenance and inspection. this is a book that should be in the library of every m1 garand collector and shooter.

 mannlicher model 95 rifle and carbine: the royal italian infantry manual 
translated by terence w. lapin.
not a week goes by that we do not get a request for information on the italian rifles. how do you take them apart? how do you shoot them? how do you disassemble the bolt? what kind of ammunition do they use? what kind of bayonet is correct? how do i use that rear sight? terry lapin, the author of "the mosin-nagant rifle" and "mauser military markings" and the translator of "the soviet mosin-nagant military manual" has provided a translation of the italian army's own manual for the mannlicher m95 (much of this information will also apply to the carcano series). this is the same manual issued to italian soldiers, but it was also used by officers and non-commissioned officers to train their men in the use of the rifle. an excellent reference work that will answer a lot of questions.
