testimonial
we live next door to one of this company's managed vacation rentals and have been pleasantly surprised by the level of care shown to the property and those who rent it. from the housekeepers to the landscapers to the guests themselves cvr has gone above and beyond in maintaining a lovely home in this small but busy community.
if we ever have out-of-town guests we know exactly who to call. ~ eldonna e., community member & facebook reviewer
