welcome to cowtown
cowtown is really three superstores in one!
cowtown has all of your pet supply needs covered with 10,000 square feet of high quality pet food, toys and pet supplies.
we are also a leading supplier of animal health supplies for larger animals like cattle and horses, including a wide array of hiqual products.
cowtown is also your wrangler flagship store, with over 5000 pairs of jeans in-stock… and not just the traditional western jeans, but ladies high fashion like miss me, rock 47, booty up, and carreli too! plus, there are thousands of pairs of boots, shirts, carhartt workwear and traditional western wear too!
like to ride? we carry saskatchewan’s widest range of western saddles and tack… everything from the smallest replacement saddle pin to the saddles themselves, and everything in between.

					i always go to cowtown in regina. it is the only pet store in the city that i’ve found to carry the dog food i buy. i also buy assorted treats from here as they have a great selection and my dog loves them. the staff is helpful, especially the cashier that is usually there when i go. would definitely recommend to someone else!
