building the creative workforce of tomorrow

 













light bringer project is a nonprofit, pasadena-based arts organization founded in 1990. inspired by the historic contributions that artists, architects, and craftsmen made to the local environment, its founders imagined ways to bring local art into the mainstream of community life. today, the organization is widely known for the arts and educational programs it provides to underserved youth in the greater pasadena and los angeles area. in keeping with its mission light bringer project has delivered a range of unique cultural arts programs and special events that utilize high degrees of collaboration, volunteerism and community-wide support.


















 








































































 











 












“from work-based learning projects, which focus on creative careers, to the room 13 creative studios, the light bringer project generates incredible programs for educators, students, parents, artists, and community members.”

— jeannine flores, arts & steam coordinator of the los angeles county office of education




“if the next generation is going to be successful, they will need to carry the stories and learning lessons from past generations forward. we need our students to be ‘in touch’ with local authors and local stories from the places and people in their lives. locavore lit does just that; it puts students in direct contact with current diverse authors with compelling stories reflecting our real human lives.”

— niki high, owner of octavia's bookshelf




“the art is underfoot in pasadena where thousands of chalk festival visitors enjoyed live music and watched more than 600 artists create colorful chalk murals on the pavement.”

— l.a. times




“doo dah parade didn’t get the memo that modern life is a highly managed, highly vetted affair. and thank goodness, too, because the slap-dashy delight has been doing its own thing, marvelously and messily, since 1978.”

— nbc
