4 surprising benefits of collagen for
                                          joint and bone health
                                       


when it comes to joint supplements, glucosamine and chondroitin are
                                          the two common remedies used to combat joint pains. but many of us
                                          may not be aware that collagen also
                                          helps to support healthy joints on top of beautiful skin. here are
                                          the four surprising benefits of collagen for joint health.
                                       
1. collagen is the building block of the body
surprise, surprise! the most abundant protein found in your body is
                                          collagen, which plays a vital role in providing support and
                                          elasticity to connective tissue, such as cartilage, bones, tendons
                                          and ligaments. collagen also provides structural support to the
                                          skin, so your skin looks young, supple and wrinkle-free.
                                       
2. collagen stimulates cartilage growth
cartilage is a firm, rubbery material that covers the end of bones in
                                          joints. over time, cartilage wear off due to ageing and repeated
                                          movement. as a result, tendons and ligaments stretch, and bones rub
                                          against each other, causing pain. collagen provides support for the
                                          growth and repair of cartilage tissue, as well as relieve joint
                                          inflammation and pain. boost collagen intake for your body, so you
                                          can sustain an active lifestyle and achieve your fitness goals.
                                       
3. collagen comforts and supports weak joints
type ii collagen is primarily found in joints, which are areas of the
                                          body more prone to wear and tear. when it comes to choosing a joint
                                          supplement, look for one that contains collagen as a key active
                                          ingredient to support joint comfort, flexibility and mobility. this
                                          is especially beneficial if you experience joint discomfort and
                                          pain, are a sports enthusiast, or suffer from arthritis.
                                       
4. collagen is twice as effective as glucosamine and chondroitin
                                       
more specifically, undenatured type ii collagen, or uc-iiâ®,
                                          has proven to be more than twice as effective in relieving joint
                                          pain as glucosamine and chondroitin combined.* brandâsâ® activmove contains
                                          uc-iiâ® and hydrolyzed type ii collagen, making it the ideal
                                          solution for the protection and maintenance of your joint health.
                                          just one tablet a day is enough to keep joint pain away.
                                       
proven effective in supporting and protecting your joint health,
                                          collagen looks to be a promising and safe alternative to the common
                                          joint supplements out there.

                                          energy and verve. here are 6 tips you can incorporate into your
                                          daily life to help you feel healthy and beautiful.
                                       
1. get active
exercise is one of the best ways to give yourself a lift. itâs also
                                          an antidote to the daily pressures of life. known to effectively
                                          treat stress, depression, anxiety and even the common cold, itâs
                                          something youâll want to work into your everyday routine. head out
                                          for a jog or plunge into the lap pool for a heart-pumping workout.
                                          getting physically active helps to release endorphins, which is the
                                          natural way to help give your body and mind a lift.
                                       
2. donât skip breakfast
jump-start your metabolism by tucking into a nutrient-rich meal in
                                          the morning such as eggs, cereals or fruits. the good doses of
                                          protein, vitamins and unprocessed carbohydrates will keep your
                                          weight in control while helping to lower cholesterol levels. eating
                                          breakfast also makes you feel good as it helps to restore glycogen
                                          and insulin levels. so, youâll be less likely to feel hungry, tired
                                          or cranky.
                                       
3. feed your skin
prized for its high glycoprotein value, people look to birdâs nest to
                                          maintain a smooth and healthy glow as well as good respiratory
                                          health. made from 100% genuine birdâs nest and brewed under hygienic
                                          processing conditions, drinking a bottle of brandâsâ® birdâs
                                          nest with rock sugar regularly can do wonders for your
                                          overall health and complexion.
                                       
4. look on the bright side
if you want a natural, zero-calorie mood booster, simply bask in warm
                                          sunshine in the morning or before dusk. spending time under the sun
                                          boosts dopamine levels and encourages vitamin d production which
                                          helps with depression. keeping a positive attitude is also key to
                                          protecting your mental well-being. it helps to put any challenges
                                          that come your way into perspective and keeps your stress level in
                                          check. so, always have a bright outlook on things!
                                       
5. stay hydrated
you may have heard this before â water is the fountain of youth. not
                                          only does it aid kidney function and cleanse your skin from within,
                                          it also relieves fatigue and boosts your immune system. if water
                                          tastes too plain for you, try adding a squeeze of lemon or adding a
                                          few sprigs of herbs to your glass. your body will thank you for
                                          drinking up and taking in enough fluids.
                                       
6. snooze away
sleep is also important, but how exactly does it help your overall
                                          well-being and happiness? for one, having enough snooze time keeps
                                          inflammation and serious illnesses at bay. studies have shown that
                                          short sleepers are at far greater risk of heart disease or stroke
                                          than those who get seven to eight hours of rest every night. on a
                                          day-to-day basis, sleeping well lets you focus better and increases
                                          your productivity at work or in school. when you stay well rested,
                                          you can be sure of feeling healthier and livelier.

shield your eyes from blue light


what exactly is it?
being exposed to blue light is unavoidable especially in this day and
                                          age where screens have become an integral part of our lives. with
                                          high screen times, it is important to protect our eyes from harmful
                                          blue light.
                                       
how does it affect the eye?
human eyes are poor at blocking blue light. since the cornea and lens
                                          are unable to block it, constant exposure damages the
                                          light-sensitive cells found in the retina. this could result in
                                          issues such as blurred vision or dry eyes, or more serious
                                          conditions such as macular degeneration. but donât worry, here are
                                          four simple tips to help you protect your eyes!
                                       
tip #1: go on a digital detox!
spend a day or so unplugged and disconnected from your electronic
                                          devices. a study conducted by the straits times has shown that the
                                          average singaporean spends a whopping 12 hours on their gadgets
                                          daily! with the high screen times, taking a break from it will not
                                          only improve your mental health, but your eye health as well.
                                          limiting blue light exposure will mitigate the negative effects of
                                          prolonged exposure. we understand that it might be tough for most of
                                          us to go on a complete digital detox. hence, weâve compiled some
                                          other tips that will shield your eyes even if you have to face a
                                          screen.
                                       
tip #2: use a blue light filter
if you canât run from the screen, change it up! most devices have
                                          blue light filters preinstalled. for example, the function is
                                          labelled as ânight shift modeâ on iphones and âblue light filterâ on
                                          samsung phones. they work by adding a yellowish tint to your screen,
                                          decreasing the amount of blue light being emitted. another kind of
                                          blue light filter you can consider is a physical one. also known as
                                          computer glasses, they work in the same way as digital filters,
                                          using a yellow-tinted lens which filters blue light.
                                       
tip #3: install warmer lighting
look up at the ceiling; the lights you see are constantly emitting
                                          blue light.if you donât mind putting in the extra effort, consider
                                          switching out the led light bulbs in your house. instead of the
                                          bright white ones, install yellow-tinted bulbs to reduce the amount
                                          of blue light your eyes are exposed to. although the lighting in
                                          your eyes house may seem a little dimmer, your eyes will definitely
                                          thank you for it!
                                       
tip #4: watch your diet
your diet is important when it comes to keeping your eyes healthy.
                                          nutrients to look out for include omega-3 fatty acids, zinc,
                                          vitamins c and e, zeaxanthin and lutein. consider taking the
                                          brandâsâ® lutein essence as a good supplement to your
                                          eye health. it contains a 5:1 ratio of lutein and zeaxanthin, which
                                          is the recommended dietary proportion to benefit vision health
                                          according the 2nd age-related eye disease study (areds). these two
                                          antioxidant nutrients are found in the eyes and protect the retina
                                          by absorbing and filtering out blue light. however, they are not
                                          produced by the body and must be consumed through diet, making the
                                          brandâsâ® lutein essence a great choice to introduce
                                          into your diet. for best results, take a bottle a day after
                                          meals! click here to
