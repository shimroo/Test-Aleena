 over 600 acres of true hunting freedom
 




 the highlands sportsmen's club is home to over 600 acres of privately maintained hunting land. tucked away from the chaos and noise of daily life, we're the haven you've been searching for. consider the highlands your personal hideaway. picture early morning treks through the countryside, rainy days in the fields, and frozen moments of gun smoke billowing over fresh crops and sawgrass. here is where generations of friends and family bond across 8 independent hunting fields—a home away from home. yeah, you could say we’re a little bit more than a hunt club.

 join us for a private
grounds tour

the highlands is for a special type of person, someone seeking somewhere to unwind and feel free. 
we would like to invite you on a private guided tour with the highlands' founder, tj sommer. no cost—it’s our treat. we’ve got a feeling you’re really going to enjoy it here.
