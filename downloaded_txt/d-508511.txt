guess who's back





miss me, bitches?why is she holding her tassel like it's some used condom she found at the foot of her bed?obviously a teenage bride-to-be escaping her polygamous sect via abandoned box cars.why do i have so many pictures in this same pose?  are they now liquoring up the seniors before their portraits?  mine could have turned out a lot better that way.why does this remind me of an opening scene from law and order?jessy from the block.it's been almost 3 years since the last senior portrait update, but i'm glad to know that flaming bats are still in vogue.  but why not shoot one with a flaming baseball?if the 'best news in town' is a firecrotch, we've read that story before.  thanks, lindsay.this was actually supposed to be taken at the top of the waterfall, but someone had to take a snack break.

what's with the little bat?  and what is up with the fascination of burning things in pictures? i really hope she is taking the hat off and not putting it on.  coincidentally, will the boler hat ever make a resurgence?dude, your bats on fire.  and why are you playing baseball in a sweater?  i wonder how much this photographer's fire insurance premiums run him.svetlana?i'm personally speechless, so i'll leave this one up to all of you.enjoy!

calling all seniors!





mom, is that you?once again, kids--if you don't know how to play an instrument, don't try to fake it in a picture. a guitar is not a harmonica. i never thought i'd have to say that. twice..we're gonna need you to close your mouth, sweetie. smile with your eyes.that is one of those outfits that i would not want there to be proof of in the future. i'm gonna leave the feather alone...i'm so glad that thte riverdance look is back in. and to think i almost threw away all of my irish jig-inspired crushed velvet outfits!  btw, are those gor-jess hair extensions?ok, well, i had more to post, but as usual, blogger is not being my friend. maybe tomorrow, if you're lucky.

hello??





well, i won't lie...i kinda forgot about this. which i'm sure everyone else did, too, so i doubt anyone is reading this. eh. who ever read it anyway?as far as the previous post, i lost interest quickly in the latest installment of the real world, so i don't even know if my predictions were true. i never got into the new challenge, either. i know. i suck. i have found time to become completely enthralled by the hills, and not because its a good show, but because heidi is like the proverbial train wreck that you just can't stop watching. sure, my iq lowers exponentially each time she has screen time, but i.can't.stop. she has become my new obsession, which is odd for me, since i don't really have much of an obsessive personality.so, as i bid 'bleh' to (most) mtv shows, i seem to have found an addiction to whatever bravo is shoving down my throat on a constant marathon basis. top chef was my crack for 3 months. i simply could not get enough of that show. so glad harold won. jonathan amazes me on a daily basis...not his talent so much as his absolute self-adoration. did anyone see when he went back to his old beauty school? it was like he was performing his daily affirmation in front of all these people. i think he may be a sociopath. of course, kathy is still my hero. but, i'm very excited about project runway. i'm not particularly into fashion, but there always seems to be such good characters on there. i haven't looked at all of the new contestants yet, but if there is an asian, i will be rooting for him/her. i don't know what it is about me and asians on bravo shows, but i'm always their biggest fan.anyway, i'm not sure the point of this post; i guess i was just trying to see if anyone still ever looked at the page. if so, leave some comments, and as soon as darren gets his internet at his very own apartment (yay, darren), we'll get this bitch back up and running, better than ever.be blessed, my children.-kev-

pseudo famous or bust!





hi, kids! sorry for the delay in posts, but darren and i were vacationing in beautiful onalaska, wisconsin. a great time was had by all. show your nothnagles!moving on...mtv has released cast photos of the new season of real world, in key west, florida. let's have a look at these e-list starved youngins, shall we?let's meet janelle first. according to mtv, she's 'very independant.' we've seen this before. move over, new york heather...this 'bi-racial beauty' is going to be nothing but a bi-racial bitch. and i love her already. aneesa ain't got nothing on her.this is john. his old nickname was 'johnny banana.' if that's not a gay reference, i don't know what is. i'm gonna guess he tries to hook up with svetlana.hiya, jose. or juan. or whatever. he was raised in brooklyn, fell in with the wrong crowd, saw violence, zzzzzzzz. whatever. he's also a property owner. great...he's gonna be like joe from miami...thinking he's all cool and whatever. let's just hope he's not short with a tall, annoying girlfriend. gosh, i hated nic.this is paula. remember melinda, anyone? i guess mtv did, so they tried to cast her clone. mtv loves them some hot girls with trashy names. she apparently 'demands the spotlightt from men and women.' ten bucks says aneesa tries to hookup with her on the gauntlet 8.welcome svetlana! great, another girl with immigrant parents struggling to conform to her parents strictness, while also trying to be the young slut her loins are trying to make her become. which side will win? i'm gonna go with slut.and, openly gay tyler. please don't be miami dan gay, unless you get into a screaming match with a spicy latina (not johanna...but melissa from miami). or philly karamo or other guy gay. he'll probably be too busy fending off johnny banana's drunken advances.so, what does everyone think of these kids so far? what are your predictions for each?

the bachelor paris





 unfortunately, i missed most of the premiere of "the bachelor paris" last night. i saw just enough to see a girl go crazy. she told the bachelor during her alone time that she was ready to enter the reproductive phase of her life. that is something every guy wants to hear on a first date. then when she did not get a rose, she whined about how she has tried every form of dating and she just can't find anybody to reproduce with her. maybe because you're crazy and you keep saying reproductive phase. this show looks like it is going to be good. i know betsy and rachel were watching in atl, so i know they will post a comment. if anyone else would like to post their thoughts on this year's bachelor, please do so.
