wellspring ministries is dedicated to helping people find answers to life’s challenges. the book of proverbs teaches that god’s word is a light to our journey and is health and healing to our bodies. at wellspring we have found this to be true! as we dig deeper into his word and learn more about his love, we find more and more answers that we need to overcome life’s challenges. click on the testimony links to see how this has worked out in my life and consequently in the lives of thousands of other people.as you explore our website, our ministries, our church, and our store, you will find many resources that are available. there are books and dvds that i have written or produced that teach how to have victory over anger, resentment, bitterness, fears, and many other negative emotions and the diseases that they cause. families, marriages, churches, and physical bodies are healed as we all learn to apply his word to our lives.we offer one-on-one counseling and prayer ministry. we teach seminars and conferences all over the world. we would love to come to your area. many of the seminars, along with our church services, are available to watch online. wellspring fellowship is a vibrant faith community that you can be part of in anchorage or wherever you live via our live-stream broadcasts.god has sent us to preach the gospel; to heal the broken hearted; to cast out demons; to heal the sick; to open their eyes, so that they will turn from darkness (without his word) to light (his word); from the power of the devil (opposition to his word) to god (giver of the word), and thus receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified (have a place) by trusting (obedience to) jesus.we invite you to take a look. please feel free to call our offices and/or correspond with us through this website if we can help in any way.god bless you! dr. art mathias founder.

















testimonies









unhealthy thought patterns led to self-harming my body, controlling others and damaging judgements. through my prayer counselor at wellspring, i am experiencing deep peace. i’m walking out of all the negative thoughts that had turned to actions.  now i have real freedom in my mind, will and emotions.  

sally





tormenting voices of utter worthlessness.  haunted by traumas from my past – now through wellspring i am experiencing my past forgiven, future is bright. i look in the mirror and see a changed person! 

wellspring client
