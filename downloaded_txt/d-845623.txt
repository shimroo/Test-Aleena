client successes


improve business performance through marketing roi optimization
ipsos mma understands there is no one-size-fits all solution to mta. its not as simple as integrating our data into an off the shelf platform. the ipsos mma team worked shoulder to shoulder with our analytics, marketing, and finance organization to develop, validate and deploy a platform that works to solve our unique needs.


jon francis | former digital & analytics officer, starbucks




measured marketing effectiveness in a holistic, accurate and globally manner
marketing is rightly being held more accountable for true business outcomes across both the short and long term, and that involves connecting multiple complex and siloed datasets for truly holistic analytics. doing so has allowed us to budget more effectively, forecast future outcomes and track true marketing effectiveness in order to optimize our investment choices across markets, campaign types and channels.
