christian praise and worship flags & banners
 






 





 




 





 






we at banners for the shepherd can provide you with unique praise flags, worship flags and banners, custom made to the highest standards of quality. they are all inspired by the lord. the praise flags can be used in an atmosphere of praise, worship, and spiritual warfare. when waved in obedience to him, you bring an annointing into the atmosphere and you come into agreement with what he wants to do in your church, conference, home or elsewhere.
every item we produce is prayed over for his anointing over you and your environment before it is sent out.
“it is i who created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work” – isaiah 54:16
here are a few videos from previous workshops that show our flags waving:
each worship flag and banner is hand crafted of the finest fabric and trims with lavish attention paid to all aspects of production and finish. made with the same attention to detail as a fine garment, they are sure to add honor and dignity to any church, business, conference or your own home setting.
the praise flags, worship flags and worship banners are embellished with beautiful, light catching trims such as iridescent sequins, metallic gold and silver edgings, tassels, and ornate fringes.
you can order from our collection or we will incorporate your choices of scripture and/or imagery into a cohesive design and transform them into a work of art to bring honor to our lord.
whatever your favorite verse or message is, we can help you create an attractive and unique banner, praise flag and or worship flag. we can even add photos of your choosing to your custom design.
we have many praise & worship flags and banners in stock. call or e-mail for availability.
we also have praise flags and banners for kids in smaller sizes!
