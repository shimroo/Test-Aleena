autoimmune support group

life
should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an
attractive and well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, chocolate in
one hand, wine in the other, body thoroughly used up, totally worn out and
screaming "woo hoo what a ride!"

we're in this
together!!
please use the links
on the left to navigate the site! read our stories, information about autoimmune
and other diseases, coping information, easy good tasting recipes, poetry and
short stories dealing with our struggles, links to great information, message
board, and more.
consider joining our mailing list below. we
know what you're going through, we're here when you really really need a laugh
or a shoulder to cry on! please sign our guest book below, so we know you were
here. while you are at it add yourself to our map page.
