jack's blog - 2/10/2025


     reflecting on trump's first presidency, despite his boldness at the time, this presidency, i see stronger similarities to the material my father wrote about trump being the antichrist [please read]. this time, he has come out strong and determined. dismantling everything that the left built over the past four years. he's working to make sweeping changes alongside elon musk. i know what people might be thinkingâthat perhaps elon is the antichrist. and yes, iâve considered that possibility as well. however, trump is regarded as the hero of christianity, not musk. he confronts and challenges anyone or any nation that stands in his path. although people attempt to damage his character and family, he always retaliates with vengeance. let us keep observing as trump continues to defeat his opponents.

     additionally, i want to begin writing about something that the lord has placed on my heart for a long time. i have a short article on the topic already but plan to elaborate on it in the coming months. i've often heard others, including family, claim they'll be ready to face it when the time comes. but they won't. you believe you can escape babylon when the devil is unveiled, but there will be no escape. many christians claim they would lay down their lives for god if escape were impossible, but i fear that might not happen either. why? the devil knows exactly what people, particularly christians, are thinking and stays one step ahead of them. consider the wall along the mexico/us border. it will be impossible to break through by the time the second half begins. this also applies to the canada/us border as trump is now intensifying measures there as well. in summary, understanding the significance of the second half of the tribulation is crucial, as escaping beforehand could be a matter of life and even salvation. we'll discuss that further later.





feature article


this is not the original piece my father wrote about trump being the antichrist; instead, it consists of several articles i found elsewhere on the old site. the articles from 2015 to 2016 are missing for some reason, so i need to search through computers and emails to find them. while this pertains to the 2016 election, it is still relevant in exploring why trump could possibly be the antichrist. enjoy!

antipas papers  


the new antipas papers - s.r., my father in the late 1970s, shearer authored the antipas papers during a period when his life was teetering on the edge due to ptsd. he wrote it just a decade after serving in vietnam, an experience that wreaked havoc on his life and continued to haunt him until his final day. through heartfelt prayers and his devotion to god, he managed to express what had been on his heart for a long time regarding the "end days." now, more than 40 years later, his book has grown to encompass additional details about the events leading up to and during the tribulation. it will help you prepare and stay vigilant for the "treaty" between israel and the antichrist, marking the beginning of the tribulation. we are approaching that event, so act as the watchman who sounds the trumpet at the onset of the tribulation.

articles


works authored by s.r. shearer covering events over a span of more than two decades leading to the last days. these events pertain to babylon's identity and the offenses it has committed against the rest of the world. s.r. shearer exposes the atrocities committed by babylon to establish itself as the world's most dominant nationâa superpower unrivaled even during periods of weak leadership. s.r. shearer uncovers spiritual corruption that most church leaders would avoid, including cia assassinations, presidents implicated in pedophilia, death squads driven by imperial greed, and other terrifying, shadowy realms that few would dare to confront. he has also explored the link between the supernatural world and babylon in his writings. additionally, he delves into the corruption within the church's ties to big business and the sacrifices they made for financial gain. he authored these articles to help you prepare for what lies ahead and to grasp the essence of the evil that has persisted into our current era.

kindly note that numerous articles remain unfinished. i am still working through the articles, revising and updating their format for the new site. i will update the list with articles as i finish them. additionally, please be aware that some recent articles cannot be modified due to the complexity of their programming, so i will keep them in their original form. i'll aim to upload my father's latest articles from before his passing within the month, though work commitments might delay the process.
