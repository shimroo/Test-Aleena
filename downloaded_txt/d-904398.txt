          selling a home is usually a stressful experience, but it was made simple and carefree by carey jean jackson at the jim allen group. she is energetic, professional, and very knowledgeable. she will be my realtor for all future endeavors.
          leeann p.


          buying a home is tough. selling a home is tough. doing both in a span of 43 days takes a superhero. luckily, sherri felton came through like the superhero she is. sherri found us the perfect home with everything we were looking for in our desired location…in our price range!!!
          jeff k.


          we had a fantastic experience with the jim allen group, especially our agent, jamie mcguire. he was recommended to us when we were searching for a home many years ago and we had such a great experience, we contacted him again when selling our home.
          ramie g.


          working with yolanda thompson was a true pleasure. she worked with us every step of the way and never failed to show up. she and tara were a great source of information and their assistance was much appreciated!
          j. f.


          working with the jim allen group was an absolute pleasure. dana kelly was extremely helpful during the process purchasing my first home. i 100% recommend working with the jim allen group as my process was stress free and easy as a first time home buyer.
          tucker b.


          phyllis is a dedicated agent who puts her clients first. she forms a personal connection with everyone she meets and works extremely hard to ensure she is finding the perfect home to meet her clients’ needs. call her today!
          kelly d.


          ashley applewhite was a wonderful, caring and resourceful help with our recent home buying experience. there is no better real estate expert than her. she’s professional, knowledgeable and is eager to ensure her clients get the absolute best results that fit their needs.
          irene a.


          we had a wonderful experience working with bronwyn drummond! professional, experienced, fun and timely on all communications! she was responsible for finding our dream home!
          shanna w.


          matt little literally performed a miracle with my house. house was sold within one week with him while another real estate company wasted five months of my time and stopped responding to me the last month. highly recommend matt little and will be using him for my next home purchase or sale.
