effren t. 



i have been a long-term contractor with dcs. i have always found them to be supportive, courteous and reliable, and have never had any issue that was not quickly resolved by their professional staff. every other contractor i know who has worked for dcs has had similar comments. i feel very fortunate to be associated with this agency.

i have worked with dcs for years, first as a consultant, then as a hiring manager, and now once more as a consultant. from both sides of the aisle, i find dcs to be professional, energetic, fun, honest, and true to their word. dcs works hard to attract top consultants and has always come through for me. a+

i am beyond honored and blessed to be part of the dynamic computing services (dcs) team of consulting professionals. if you want to receive impeccable customer service with a holistic approach, sprinkled with the utmost respect and confidence, then look no further. dcs has a proficient knack for making this consultant feel extra special and valued. this is truly a remarkable organization.











 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 








 






 






richard h. 



i had the pleasure of working with dcs in a contract position during 2023 and 2024. it could not have been a better experience. any time i had a question, or needed clarification, someone from dcs was always there with not only an answer, but also inquiring if they could do anything else to make my work experience better. i’ve worked for a few different contracting organizations in my career, and dcs is easily the most professional, the most supportive, and the most rewarding experience i’ve had. i would highly recommend them to anyone i know.











 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 








 






 






oscar d. 



i really like working at dynamic computing services. the onboarding and hiring process was very fast and they were able to get me in with a competitive hourly rate.  i also enjoyed meeting the hiring team in person! it makes a big difference to connect a face with a name.











 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 








 






 






steve d. 



i was initially a bit apprehensive going to ”contractor status” after being employed, “regular, full-time” for nearly 30 years, however, dcs did a great job with the onboarding process. if i did have a question, it was answered within a few hours. overall, i enjoyed supporting the client and worked with excellent professionals and colleagues as a telecom project manager. i definitely recommend dynamic computing services if you are considering contract support in the it and/or healthcare profession.











 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 



 

 








 






 






vikram r. 



i’ve been working with dcs now for over a year and half and everything has been seamless. they have placed me with a strong client that i am able to get consistent extensions from and the logistics of all overheads are taken care of by the firm so i can just focus on doing the work. i have a direct line to communicate with several members of the firm so i can get questions answered quickly about benefits, timesheets, medical documentation updates, and extensions quickly. they even send gifts once in a while and its always nice to be appreciated. overall it has been one of the best firms i’ve worked with.
