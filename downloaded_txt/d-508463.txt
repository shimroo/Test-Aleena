who throws a shoe (at the president)? honestly!





just in case you live on titan moon and didn't see this video, i have decided to post it. the event took place about a month ago. in that amount of time, i have learned that it is a horrible insult (in the middle eastern culture) to have a shoe thrown at you. go figure. to each his own. i guess. i just think it's funny how the president ducks the first one and then gets right back up, almost challenging the guy: "hey. c'mon. is that all you got!" zing!

truthiness comes to washington.  hilarity ensues.





what network has the most intelligent news and societal commentary on television today? well, it has become (painfully) obvious that distinction now belongs to comedy central. if there ever was a time when cnn, msnbc, fox news (hahaha!), or any of the major network news offered insight into the events that shape our world, that time has now passed.stephen colbert's irony filled evisceration of both the white house and the press at the white house correspondents' association dinner was merely latest example of how the assembly of talent put together at comedy central is the primary source of real dissent on television to the major powers in american media. this article from salon is the best i've seen so far on colbert's speech, and summed up what the politicians in washington should start to realize..."make no mistake, stephen colbert is a dangerous man -- a bomb thrower, an assassin, a terrorist with boring hair and rimless glasses. it's a wonder the secret service let him so close to the president of the united states."

friday quote of the day





“we have been chosen, ... by fate or providence or whatever you wish to call it. as far as we can tell, we are the best there is. we may be all there is. it's an unnerving thought that we may be the living universe's supreme achievement and its worst nightmare simultaneously.”-bill bryson
