"the president's actions cannot hide or sweep away what occurred on jan. 6th ... nor of the events leading up to it", says terry lynch, executive director. prior to the 6th members of the proud boys and others wreaked violence and havoc at churches in downtown washington at two âstop the stealâ events, precursors to the tragic events of the 6th. the leader of the proud boys was convicted of stealing and burning the black lives matter sign of the historic african american asbury united methodist church. "their actions both at events on and before january 6th were meant to not just intimidate but to spread fear ... if not even overturn the results of the election. lives were tragically lost and irreparably damaged by these events. the president's pardons and commutations - including those convicted of violence - cannot erase the damage nor the lasting impacts caused by those who were guilty of crimes that day. we so strongly disagree with his sweeping actions, and we do not forget", says mr. lynch. "the president's actions have denied justice to the many victims of the events of that day and especially for the some 150 capitol and dc police who were injured and those that died."

the downtown cluster of congregations celebrates the exemplary life of congressman john lewis. "more than a congressman, he was a prophet for america", says terry lynch, executive director. "his life's work is not just a history lesson on making america a more just and equitable place, but a roadmap we must follow going forward. godspeed brother john."


statement by rev. rob fisher of st. john's church, lafayette square
we at st. john's church were shocked at the surprise visit from the president this evening and even more appalled at the violent clearing of lafayette square to make the visit possible. st. john's is a community that welcomes all-from powerful presidents to the homeless-to worship god. we fully espouse the words of our baptismal covenant, which says, in part, that we "will strive for justice and peace among all people and respect the dignity of every human being."
living that covenant, we stand with those peacefully protesting the tragic and unnecessary death of george floyd, and the far too many who came before him.
we pray that our nation finally confronts its history of racism and, as a result, can fully embrace the peace of god that passes all understanding.
