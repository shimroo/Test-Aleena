recovery timefebruary 4, 2022

i have decided to close my books on new orders for a time, probably into 2023. recovery from carpal tunnel surgery has slowed me down some, so for now i am happy to keep only a waiting list open for later. looking forward to more lj’s, les planks and classics after this pile is finished.
