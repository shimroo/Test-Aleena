creating the future through design 



60 years of excellence in architecture and design



hobbs+black has been a trusted name in architecture since 1965. we are a team of licensed architects, interior designers, and planners. we're not just designing structures but crafting spaces that foster connections, enriching lives, and transform communities.














our services



architecture



hobbs+black believes in the demonstration of the identity of the client, not the identity of our designers. there is no certain style of hobbs+black. with nearly 60 years in practice we have prided ourselves in our ability to produce architecture of a timeless value that represents the client’s standing in the community and the image of the overall system, not just the building image. 



planning



whether an institutional client or a retail developer, long and short term planning can provide the necessary tools to provide the future building and infrastructure needs to accomplish your mission, vision, and strategic plan. hobbs+black has a long history of assisting our clients with their facility assessment and master planning needs, from small-scale roof replacement studies or conceptual site plans to campus master plans.



interior design



the interior design studio has an award-winning portfolio exhibiting projects from a variety of sectors including education, corporate office, healthcare, hospitality, and senior living. our clients range from small organizations seeking economically efficient work space solutions to cutting edge healthcare facilities bridging the gap between comfort and sterility.
