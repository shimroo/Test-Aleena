welcome to m-fix, est.

                      news update on 30th april 2020

                      lockdown edition....

                      you can now view the new website progress here
                      - please be patient!

                      parts development news! - i'm hoping to start up a
                      design/build/production for obsolete parts later this
                      year, this has been progressing behind the scenes but i'm
                      hoping to start to provide a source of some very useful m
                      series parts in the not too distant future. 


                      older news

                      website is being redesigned - mainly due to html5 etc
                      being incompatible with the old site. i am adding all the
                      old members area pages to this site (ie. no more
                      membership area) as things have changed so much & the
                      internet is full of how-to stuff on youtube etc. i will be
                      starting a much needed parts area with the intention of
                      opening an online store for parts in autumn/fall or winter
                      2019/20. still early stages with that but i'm looking
                      along the lines of small production runs using both
                      traditional production methods and modern technology. if
                      you have any ideas for this please send in a survey form!
                      thank you - and thanks for the supporting this site!

                      taimar tailgate wanted - new or used condition please
                      contact me & i will pass your details on to the owner.
                      see menu - about - contact to email.

                        older news

                        the end of the long summer's approaching. latest news is
                        that the website will get some extra pages very soon,
                        i'm getting round to opening up all the old members area
                        to the main site. this has been closed for a long while
                        to members as the way the internet works has changed so
                        much from the early days. this means a lot more content
                        here for all m series owners, as well as all the v6
                        essex engined cars. feel free to drop me a line if you
                        wish to see anything you can't find in the current
                        articles.

                      getting ready for a new season....and a new era

                      at the moment, it seems rare classic car prices are
                      soaring due to the financial slump, combined with
                      uncertainty in the future of interest rates, the 'b' word,
                      and some interesting (if not always predictable) changes
                      in the world order. the media seems to be fuelling this
                      trend even further. i wonder how many of you have decided
                      to hang on to an old classic that you would have otherwise
                      sold, simply as it's a better investment? or whether
                      keeping the car has nothing to do with being financially
                      savvy, and is more to do with sentiment or just the love
                      of everything pre ecu or earlier. many 80's
                      & 90's cars are fast becoming the new 'useable'
                      investment, providing an appreciating asset, but at the
                      same time allowing the owner to have a bit of fun along
                      the way. we are fast becoming blase to the changes around
                      us, and if you've been lucky enough to have a a ride in an
                      electric car recently, you might start wondering what's
                      going to be next. a family saloon that does 0-60 in under
                      4 seconds, without anything but tyre noise? faster than
                      many exotic sports cars, and supposedly safer at the same
                      time. perhaps not my cup of tea, but it's going to be hard
                      to ignore the performance available once prices come down
                      to a level that the average person can afford. 

                      who knows what the future will bring, but technology is
                      moving things further, faster, but farther from the days
                      of the home mechanic. i just hope that somewhere along the
                      way there will be something that can bring back some real
                      fun & enjoyment from owning a car, instead of simply
                      providing us with a means to get from a to b in the
                      fastest & safest way. insulated spanners & 400
                      volts, that's not going to be something you can tune up
                      without a few years training!

                      sept 2016

it's been a great summer this year for taking the car
                    out this year (in the uk at least). website work still yet
                    to be more than the odd update here & there, but it's
                    not going to stay like that forever. i have some exciting
                    new projects coming up and hope to divulge more in the
                    coming weeks.

                    thanks as always to those of you who use my website for
                    info, and also thanks to those who contact me wherever you
                    may be! it's amazing to know that the oldest tvrs are still
                    being driven all round the world.
hope you had a good weekend
                    - great driving weather! i've put a couple of new parts for
                    sale in the m-fix store -for 2500m owners. please keep your
                    survey forms coming in as i'm working on a few ideas for
                    building up a stock of parts for the m series cars.
 interesting
                      new website for tvr - includes news on the new car &
                      factory

                      hope you had a good easter. now the weather will
                      (hopefully) start to improve, the first news is that
                      there's a good 2500m for sale. now sold - now sold - now

                      just added the cooling overview & air conditioning
                      page. these have been missing for some time.

 i am (still) working on a new design
                    for the website. thanks for all your support this year
                    (2015), and also for the submitted survey forms which allow
                    me to fine tune my plans for the website & hopefully
                    some new parts etc in 2016.

                    uroglas heated windscreens for m series tvrs
sad to say autumn is
                      creeping up on us this month (already), and to be safe at
                      night in your tvr a new windscreen is one way of making
                      your vision clearer.

uroglas can supply tinted, heated
                    windscreens for the tvr m series (also fits pre m series
                    cars). 
heating is by a fine wire system
                    embedded between the glass layers (similar to that in a ford
                    mondeo). the tech.spec. is 12v, 14amps, 168watts.
comes with cable connections for live
                    and earth. requires a relay (preferably with timer �
                    available from ford for mondeo/focus heated screens) and a
                    switch (push-button, reset type if using a timer relay).
these screens are available off the
                    shelf @ �246.00 + vat + shipping (shipping is �65 + vat to
                    most parts of mainland uk). worldwide shipping not a
                    problem.
anyone interested in purchasing a heated
                    windscreen should contact uroglas via email 
                      sr@uroglas.com or by telephone +44 (0) 1527 577 477.
                    (please mention you saw the advert on the m-fix website)

unheated also available
                    we can also supply unheated screens. these are made to order
                    with around a five week lead time. clear laminated glass is
                    �189 + vat, green tint is �192 + vat and clear or green with
                    a blue top shade band are �198 + vat. shipping is as for the
                    heated windscreen.

                          http://www.fastroadcars.co.uk
as a webcon dealer, they are now selling reproduction
                    weber intake stacks for the 40 & 42 dcnf weber carbs.
                    i've just bought a set, so here's a better view for anyone
                    who's after a set for their essex (or ferrari)! 

 

                    newer versions of the dcnf come with a built in style of
                    intake on the carb top, (i have this type). milling
                    these new style intakes off and fitting the older style
                    intake stack ought to improve the airflow, especially on
                    cars with limited clearance between the carbs and the bonnet
                    (the 3000m/s for starters). the newer (built in) intakes
                    appear to be lacking a good rounded end, so these stacks are
                    a welcome return. the part number is 52848.001. availability
                    - good.

                        old tyres

                        in more recent years, i've noticed that tyres
                        deteriorate much faster than those from previous
                        decades. many classics i come across have tyres from the
                        80's, or even before. it's amazing they're still being
                        used, without any signs of perishing sidewalls or cracks
                        between the treads. it's questionable if these should
                        still be used for the obvious reason of safety, but i
                        come across tyres from newer vehicles which seem to
                        perish badly after only 4 or 5 years. the compounds may
                        have changed - that's one possible reason, but also
                        perhaps quality has been compromised in some instances.
                        it would be good to hear from any of you with the
                        classic tvrs, with any tips on good brands/models of
                        tyres for the original rims which you feel have the best
                        grip, and are of better quality. equally, if you have
                        any bad experience of tyre, let me know how/why it is
                        less than excellent. feel free to drop me a line - email

                        valve seat regression....

                        if any of you have older tvrs with v6 essex or cologne
                        engines, it's worth knowing if your car has had hardened
                        valve seats fitted. i looked at a cobra kit car a while
                        back with a v6 cologne, that ran fairly well until the
                        engine warmed up. it would then stall, and feel like it
                        was starved of petrol. after some basic checks, i found
                        all the valve/rocker clearances were way too tight.
                        after adjusting to the correct clearance, the car ran
                        well and didn't stall when hot. the owner had bought the
                        car without knowing about this. i came across the same
                        again last year on a v6 essex. valve seat wear was so
                        bad that the valve faces were lower than the head
                        surface!

                  to the java plugin problems that have made this site more
                  & more tricky to view recently. i'm still working on some

 5th
                    september 2013 - site menu update underway. the java
                  menu above is becoming difficult to maintain due to the way
                  new browsers work, and java settings also tend to blank it out
                  unless the user reduces java security. the only option is to
                  add a css menu system instead which i'm currently working on.

                  - are your carb spindles straight? 

                    balancing carbs has been a common job for me this year, and
                    i'm seeing quite a few cases (on twin port carbs like weber
                    dcoe, dcnf, plus tr6 injection throttle bodies) where the
                    spindle has been bent. this may not seem important, but any
                    mis-alignment of the butterflies as a pair results in
                    incorrect airflow where it matters - at idle and part
                    throttle. even though the carb models mentioned have air
                    bypass screw to allow for the slight differences you'll find
                    on most if not all carbs, any more than a slight difference
                    can mean the transition holes are not being uncovered at the
                    same time, causing poor running at lower speeds & idle.
                    the 38dgas has gears to join the twin spindles, so doesn't
                    quite suffer the same as the combined spindle models. the
                    cause of a bent spindle can be a) no throttle pedal stop,
                    causing excessive force b) loose butterfly causing it to jam
                    in the carb/throttle body throat c) incorrect assembly
                    procedure d) foreign object (or screwdriver used to hold
                    open carb - seriously i've seen people in garages do this
                    instead of lock the linkage carefully)! if you have any
                    problems getting smooth running, get yourself a synchrometer
                    & check out those spindles!

                        the great british.....summer?
16th june 2013 -
                  the bad winter & spring has left many of us with cars in
                  garages here in the uk. classic car owners are finally getting
                  their cars out for shows & weekend use, but the rain is
                  back again for mid-june!

                  i've recently been in contact with uroglas during my
                  day-to-day work on classics - they have provided some updated
                  information regarding their tvr m series heated & non
                  heated windscreens which may be of interest:

                  m series heated windscreen = �239.00 +vat
                  m series windscreen (clear) =�168.00 +vat 
                  """"""""""""""""""""""""""" (green tinted) = �179.00 +vat
                  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""(shade band) = �187.00 +vat 
uk shipping is �60.00 + vat
rear screens at present are not available.

                        march 1st - electronic ignition info - more
                      recently, a few new sources of electronic ignition have
                      been appearing at buget prices. for years the main options
                      available were the lumenition & aldon ignitor kits.
                      both are very well made, reliable, fairly easy to fit, but
                      prices are higher than the new accuspark kit as seen on
                      ebay. how does the accuspark compare? i have recently
                      fitted a couple of these kits (aldon ignitor &
                      accuspark)to customers' cars, and my findings will appear
                      in the ignition section this month.

                        march 1st - i've finally done a little work

december 15th 2011 - scam alert!
                      when placing an advert on this website (or any other)
                      please consider what contact details you wish to be
                      displayed. this is due to a recent advert placed by a tvr
                      owner in the wanted section which attracted the attention
                      of a hoax seller. in this case the motive was probably to
                      somehow extract cash from the buyer without any part
                      existing. if you leave your email address, please be aware
                      that this may be used by a malicious person (or harvesting
                      software) which meay lead to some sort of scam. if you
                      leave your phone number instead, you may find it easier to
                      judge if a caller is genuine. either way, remember that
                      your contact details are in the public domain. classic tvr
                      parts are sometimes very scarce, and as such may attract
                      clever fraudsters who know people are looking for rare
                      items.

                      to adjust one of these and have managed to get my hands on

jul 16 2011: fuel prices & lpg
                      conversions - i'm wondering how long it will be
                      until classic tvrs will be forced to use lpg just to stay
                      on the uk roads. people who see the old 3000m when i'm out
                      ask if it's an lpg car - simply as they can see the
                      cylindrical fuel tank through the rear window. i really
                      need to make a crash cage for it and then cover it as it
                      is getting a bit boring to get asked all the time. it does
                      however make more sense to think about these days as fuel
                      has recently been as high as �1.49 gbp per litre ($9.73
                      usd per gallon) in this neck of the woods, and even higher
                      elsewhere or at motorway service stations. 

i have another gas guzzling vehicle, and recently
                      did a check on the fuel consumption as it's too old to
                      have an mpg gauge on the dash. here are my workings:
 
300 miles used approx �71.50 (�115.19) fuel which
                      equates to 25.38mpg  
if i converted to lpg, with 20% loss in fuel
                      economy then:  
300 miles would use approx �49.14 ($79.17) lpg =
                      31.28% cost saving  
the cost of such a conversion on that vehicle
                      would be approx �1200, or �600 for me to do myself plus
                      �300 to get it checked & approved before use.
                      therefore per 300 miles with a saving of approx �22 (or 13
                      miles for every �1 saved), then i would need to drive
                      15600 before the conversion is worthwhile, or 11700 miles
                      if i convert the engine. that is just about a year's
                      driving, so well worth the cost if keeping the vehicle for
                      a few years.  
doing this to an old v6 essex engine would be
                      possible i'm sure, but would prefer to have the lpg tank
                      fully sealed and not inside the car. it all depends on the
                      price of lpg though, as if more people keep changing over
                      to it, the price will creep up for sure. another issue
                      would be that for track day use (as many owners would like
                      to do), the fuel tank as a backup would need to be large
                      enough to allow petrol to be the track day fuel. then
                      comes the question of whether the marshals would allow an
                      lpg car on the race track (a health and safety issue no
                      doubt).  
 the 3000m in its current state of tune does
                      approx 18mpg - well worth considering an alternative for
                      economy runs at least.
  
   
jul 16 2011: wasted time when ordering online
                        - when car parts are supplied incorrectly or not on
                      the day expected it can be the most frustrating thing.
                      having worked in a couple of parts departments in the past
                      then certain problems can arise from lack of staff
                      experience, lack of interest, low wages, heavy workload
                      from both retail & trade customers, as well as from
                      other departments within the car dealership. needless to
                      say sometimes the customer can't explain the part they
                      require or misunderstand the fault they have with their
                      car.  
in my business i order parts both locally and
                      online, to meet my customers' needs. i can say that pretty
                      often a part can be supplied incorrectly, even when the
                      invoice shows the correct item if the part is picked
                      incorrectly. local purchases are easier to return as you
                      don't have to pack & post the parts back. this brings
                      me to the question - how do i buy my car parts? cost is
                      obviously a large factor - but this has to be weighed
                      against availability, time to receive, what if the part is
                      supplied incorrectly? sometimes it is better to pay more
                      for a part you can source locally, as you save a day, and
                      save money in the long-run if the part comes wrong or
                      damaged. another interesting fact is that sometimes buying
                      a group of parts can be cheaper than individual parts.
                      last week i needed a track rod end for an old 90's bmw.
                      these have 2 track rod ends on each side, plus a track rod
                      that joins them. i needed to replace just one joint -
                      which was �9+vat, however the whole assembly was seized
                      solid, so i went back to replace the part with the whole
                      thing which came to �21. it saved a load of work &
                      meant the tracking (on that side) could be adjusted with
                      ease.  
 in more recent years, many dealerships who own a
                      chain of garages (in the uk) have decided to create a
                      "parts only" operation where they have a business
                      dedicated just to selling parts, sometimes for more than
                      one manufacturer. one such company is tps (part of the
                      listers group) who sell audi, vw, seat & skoda parts
                      and they cover 95% of the uk. parts are the same price
                      unless you're in the trade (like myself), but they are
                      staffed well and stock is high - meaning parts may be
                      available off the shelf.  
i'm not plugging any parts suppliers, but just
                      wanted to make you aware that things are slowly changing
                      for the better when it comes to buying parts for your car.
                      the motor trade has a poor reputation in this area,
                      largely due to the parts dept. profits (usually) being the
                      lowest for any high street garage when compared to the
                      service & sales dept's.   
this leads me on to tvr parts - and the benefit
                      of owning a car which has parts taken from the most
                      popular vehicles of the period. most of the engine parts
                      are available from the usual major classic suppliers such
                      as rimmer brothers for the triumph & rover bits, moss
                      europe, burton power for the ford parts and so on.
                      unfortunately some parts for the 70's cars are not easy to
                      find now, and ebay may well be the first & last place
                      you find rarer bits. ebay is a great source of reference
                      too - sometimes a photo of a part is all you need to see
                      to make sure you are buying the correct item elsewhere.
                      part numbers can also help if you have them - google shows
                      up many obsolete parts but at least allows measurements to
                      be gleaned from original plans. eventually many parts will
                      become unavailable and production runs for a limited
                      number of units will be the only way forward. this is
                      already happening with tvr windscreens (albeit for heated
                      versions), but also for the tvr s front indicators (old
                      freight rover sherpa parts). private individuals get
                      involved in this and you can find a lot of chat on this
                      subject if you visit pistonheads.  

                        july 15 2011: brake bleeding - as a mobile mechanic
                      i have many different types of work to do and sometimes
                      find problems with cars caused by bad previous repairs.
                      the latest one made me laugh, but also proves the danger
                      of mixing up parts before refitting. i needed to replace
                      the front flexible brake hoses on an old jaguar plus a
                      caliper piston seal that was leaking due to old age. i
                      replaced the caliper seal and brake hose on one side,
                      refitted it, then did the other. bled the brakes (even
                      replaced the bleed screws to ensure they will not seize
                      up) - job done...or so i thought. i noticed that the bleed
                      screws were at the bottom of the caliper piston rather
                      than the top, however as the fluid bled ok i proceeded to
                      road test the car. each time i braked, the pedal almost
                      hit the floor! a couple of pumps and the pedal worked
                      again but any emergency stop would have been impossible. i
                      returned and removed one caliper so the bleed screw was
                      vertical, stuck a block of wood in between the pads, then
                      opened the bleed screw with a clear bleed pipe attached.
                      air instantly flowed into the pipe for a good 15-20
                      seconds, therefore proving the calipers were the wrong way
                      round. i swapped them over & re-bled the system - all
                      then worked correctly. the owner said the brakes had been
                      removed for caliper work 4 years before, but i'm not sure
                      why the garage swapped them over - almost certainly a mix
                      up, but they did manage to bleed the brakes so they may
                      have known about this at the time. even pressure bleeding
                      the calipers in the upside down position didn't bleed out
                      the air as i tried this just out of curiosity.

here is the long awaited new tr6 rear hub assembly
                    now being stocked by rimmer brothers here in the uk. it is
                    indeed completely new which should come as a relief to many
                    owners, as the stub axle is easily bent when attempts are
                    made to remove the hub flange without a special tool. even a
                    40 ton press sometimes fails to press the flange out due to
                    flexing of the flange on the tapered stub axle. i bought
                    this to replace the bent stub axle on the 3000m as the ones
                    that are given as an exchange item are frequently out of
                    true. note this doesn't come with the wheel studs so they
                    need to be purchased separately. the other good thing about
                    having a new one is the u/j yoke is going to be a nice tight
                    fit - replacing the worn original which was loose with the
                    bearing casings spinning causing further wear. article on
                    fitting this to appear in the members area as soon as it's
                    up & running. 


 
brand new rear hub assemblies now available from
                      rimmer brothers, finally in stock - check here . i've just ordered and
                      received one of these, and it is a simple job of replacing
                      with the original. no more wobbles on the back wheel (due
                      to a bent stub axle)!
1st april - server problem still ongoing. however
                      i have put a couple of new adverts on the marketplace
                      pages - a 3000s for sale, plus a new parts wanted advert.
update march 22nd 2011 -
                        server work has been continuing, hope to have some news
                        on the modem tomorrow (i am disappointed at the low
                        level of support from certain world leading
                        manufacturers, and the quality of their firmware). i
                        find it incredible that two modern routers and one modem
                        purchased all have problems with their software or
                        glitches that make easy networking a monumental task.
                        think i'm getting somewhere now but so far have spent
                        over �500 gbp to sort this problem!
update
                        march 9th 2011 - hardware compatibility problems are
                        causing some trouble at present. i have spent at least
                        30 hours in the last week setting the new server up but
                        am waiting for a manufacturer to provide either new
                        modem firmware or replacement unit. apologies for this
                        unforseen problem but the new server will be worth it i
                        promise! membership will be extended to those who have
                        paid - refunds can be made if anyone wishes, just email
                        me on the contact button above.
work is underway on the web
                      server, so it will be offline from 6pm gmt 20th jan until
                      the weekend if not sooner. members will have extended
                      memberships due to this, apologies for this unforseen
                      event. update on 26th jan - looks like a replacement
                      server is necessary as is 12 years old now. new one on the
                      way but may take a while to get this up & running so
                      working on a temporary server. update on 5th march - web
                      server working but need another modem, members area will
                      be back up very soon now.

                      update today (20th jan 2011) - i have finally bought
                    a decent scanner, so am working on re-scanning all the old
                    paper photos from the 1990's restoration. i don't have many
                    extra photos but will add them anyhow as anything new is
                    better for reference! i've just done the sunroof page - take
                    a look as the pics are so much clearer now.

                      mot's for classics in oxford, uk

                    if you're looking for a friendly garage to mot your classic
                    tvr (or any other car for that matter), i can recommend
                    t&t motor services in oxford. with years of experience
                    they are more familiar with classic cars than many fast fit
                    testing stations, some of whom may fail an item that they
                    are unfamiliar with.

                    just been looking at rear disc brake conversions for the tr6
                    running gear for someone asking if it can be done on a
                    taimar. found this useful link: http://www.britishv8.org/articles/tr6-rear-disc-brakes.htm

                    over the last few weeks of cold weather i've come across
                    quite a few engines where the thermostat has either stuck
                    open, or is opening too soon therefore meaning the engine
                    can't heat up fully. the latest was today on a modern car
                    with a diagnostic computer check showing at 81�c the
                    thermostat opened, then the temp dropped to 79�c, then the
                    thermostat closed, temp then rose to 81�c and continued in
                    these cycle. this is of course easy to spot on a modern car
                    with technology to support the symptoms, however on old
                    vehicles this is not as easy unless you're prepared to wire
                    up a digital temp gauge as a test tool. what seems to be
                    (these days) a rare fault, it is unusual for me to see so
                    many thermostats fail during the last few weeks. this brings
                    me to the assumption that the cold weather allows faults
                    with thermostats to be made more noticeable, simply as the
                    heater inside the vehicle seems to take ages to get warm. it
                    may also be possible (although i've no way of proving this
                    yet) that prolonged periods of cold which have not been seen
                    for many years (at least here in the uk) may have some
                    effect on the thermostat's reliability. all vehicles tested
                    had a good antifreeze mix incidentally so ice was not a
                    factor. so....if your car or car seems to be taking a lot
                    longer to warm up, the best way to check the thermostat is
                    to touch the radiator after 2 or 3 minutes running, and
                    before the temp gauge reaches the normal position. if the
                    radiator warms up across its width, then the thermostat is
                    most likely opening too early (or is stuck even partially
                    open). it's a cheap part to replace and will benefit the
                    fuel economy and your driving comfort. just be aware that
                    the fan & auxiliary belts are usually close to the
                    radiator so be careful ;op
carbs now matched, just making new gaskets so will
                    be road testing before christmas.

                    carb work is continuing during the very cold weather - loads
                    added to the weber 40 dcnf tuning section which may help
                    others with twisted throttle spindles when carb balancing is
                    required. latest work will see the result of altering the
                    carb butterflies to make a matched pair in each carb. see
                    members area for findings.
as the winter is drawing in i've decided to offer a
                    carb rebuild service for tvr owners (and any other carbs for
                    that matter). i'm trying to reduce my time on the road as a
                    mobile auto technician and get more into internet services
                    which i am hoping will expand over the next few months. if
                    you have a carb that needs rebuilding, please feel free to contact
                      me for further info. a page dedicated to this will
                    appear on this website very shortly.

                    winter is coming - will it be another cold one? this year
                    i've decided to invite all tvr owners to send in their best
                    winter tvr photo. the gallery will be opened today,
                    so please feel free to send in your photo. i will resize to
                    allow viewing on the same scale for each photo on the
                    webpage, photos in jpeg format if possible please. you can
                    also add a caption if you like for a bit more fun!
at last i have found time to get
                    the 3000m's wilwood vented brake conversion working to a
                    good standard. the problem was getting the brake pedal to be
                    high enough due to the 4 pot calipers needing a larger
                    displacement of brake fluid compared with the old tr6 2 pot
                    calipers. i am just preparing the write up & it will be
                    posted into the members area shortly, photos to follow in a
                    couple of days.

                    tvr track day castle combe 24th september 2010 - another
                    year's gone by - and the 3000m still isn't finished (yet).
                    however, this time i took my hd camera so check out the
                    videos on the m-fix youtube page. no classic tvrs were on
                    the track but it was still good with some quick cars - http://www.youtube.com/tvrmfix

                    i've found a useful website for m series shock absorbers,
                    brake pads, discs & hoses - check here

                    i've managed to update the website today and change the menu
                    page to white at last. i've also added some interesting
                    information regarding 3.4 litre essex engines from south
                    africa (see
                      here), plus some other info. regarding a carburettor
                    problem which may be overlooked (here).

                    moss europe are now selling new rear hub units for the tr6 -
                    at last you can replace the whole item including flange,
                    stub axle & wheel bearing without trying to dismantle
                    the old one. many reconditioned hubs are not 100% true as i
                    found out when i bought one a few years ago. look here: http://www.moss-europe.co.uk/shop/viewproducts.aspx?plateindexid=18142
members area is currently now online - see below:
finally the members area server is now on after a
                    few changes. at present the site remains as before until i
                    can get time to change things around to make it easier to
                    navigate and have a better appearance. all current members
                    will have their memberships extended as an apology for the
                    length of time the server was offline.
 the server power supply exploded as i turned the
                    system back on today - seems that it didn't like being off
                    for 10 days. i now need a new server as it's 11 years old
                    now and has lasted well (was on its 3rd power supply). i'm
                    now looking into a new server system which will allow faster
                    access and more storage, plus up to date software which has
                    been a bit of an issue over the last couple of years for me
                    to contend with. members will be given extra membership time
                    to cover this -- again please accept my apologies. a further
                    update on the situation will appear on this page as soon as
                    i know more.
brake caliper conversion is now finished, photos
                    being compiled for a new section. the brake pedal travel is
                    as expected a lot longer, so the master cylinder will have
                    to be replaced with a suitable alternative. i'm looking into
                    this right away & will get modding. once complete i can
                    reveal the info. to make this an easy change for anyone out
                    there with the same problem.

                    started the brake conversion today (29th april 2010) -about
                    time! all went well apart from the weather. lucky that i
                    have the necessary flaring tools etc to manufacture any pipe
                    shape i need - combined with some euroquip fittings it's
                    making the upgrade a breeze. also as a bonus, the wilwood
                    calipers fit inside the standard t slot 14" alloy wheel with
                    a few mm to spare, so that has saved a snowball effect in
                    terms of cost. photos not yet published but a full step by
                    step fitting guide will follow once the job is finished.
                    next will be testing and possibly a master cylinder
                    replacement to allow for further pedal travel which won't be
                    a surprise as there may be more fluid displacement. 

                    i've just received an email from someone selling a few new
                    crated ford v6 essex 3.4l engines, as seen on ebay a while
                    back. have a look here
                    for more details.
a bit of trivia for easter...i just
                    by chance saw the "under pressure" queen/david bowie video
                    from the early 1980's. about 28 seconds into the video
                    there's a v6 essex engine that explodes...noticed it by the
                    sump shape as it flies through the air! rewind and pause
                    with sky+ and it's definitely this engine. an abstract blog
                    maybe, but i wonder why on earth the engine was blown up -
                    whether it was done for the music video, or whether it was
                    old footage from some other test?? take a look here:

i'm just installing a new router,
                    so apologies for members - website is still down due to
                    technical changes required. it seems all routers are
                    different and each one has its quirks! members will get
                    extra time added to the end of their memberships for this. i
                    have also added a couple of videos to the m-fix youtube
                    channel (see below). much more to follow, those were just a
                    couple i could get done while checking out the new brake kit
                    i will be fitting.

                    interesting website now in my links page - south west sports
                    cars specialise in tvr hire in the south west - see http://www.southwestsportscars.co.uk/

                    as mentioned in previous blog (below), work now commencing.
                    i have an hd camera at last, so finally you'll get to see
                    some proper m series tvr footage, maintenance & video
                    articles that have taken almost a decade to appear. i'm just
                    thankful technology has caught up with the internet at last!
                    i hope to get the youtube channel up & running with the
                    first hd video or two in the next week http://www.youtube.com/tvrmfix
i'm finally getting some more work
                    started on the car - so to follow once completed will be a
                    step-by-step guide to modifying the front brakes. this will
                    be a conversion to modern performance 4 pot alloy calipers
                    & vented discs. i am also hoping to publish video
                    footage of this mod. and all further published work will be
                    viewable in video to keep up with modern times. dashboard
                    refit to follow the brake mods.

the cold weather is still with us,
                    but i have made sure i get a day working on the 3000m next
                    week. will try my best to update the site with some new
                    photos. i have promised some more photos of the window
                    winder mechanism. any more requests for photos showing
                    particular detail are welcome ;o)

1600m for restoration up for sale this week - see
                    marketplace section. also the snow has caused the updates to
                    this site to be delayed as i haven't been able to get the
                    car out since before christmas. this will go ahead as soon
                    as the weather improves.
following 4 days without broadband,
                    i have aded a few site updates. check parts for sale section
                    for 3x v6 essex engines for sale in spain.

                    dare i say merry christmas? 

                    a few updates this week to the technical questions section.
                    also welcome to the new members this week - seems the winter
                    weather means a few of you have the tvr jacked up ready for
                    some maintenance!
also worth a mention is that i'm
                    working on the whole website after christmas if the tax
                    return takes less than a couple of weeks...
                    plans include hopefully adding a new look, better graphics
                    (not difficult!), more content including plenty of tuning
                    videos, and a much better user interface. this will also
                    apply to the members area, and perhaps even involve a new
                    faster web server as the old one has been running for the
                    last 10 years now!
i have been working on all
                    types/makes of cars recently, breakdowns mainly, but the odd
                    tuning job has been there to break the monotony. this month
                    the interesting job has been a triumph spitfire 1500,
                    fitting a stage 2 unleaded head, 4-2-1 exhaust, and tuning
                    the twin su hs4's afterwards. i'm still working on the
                    second needle trial as the first set are too lean, but
                    having the right tools makes the job easy nowadays, compared
                    to the guesswork in the 1970's/80's/90's unless you had a
                    load of cash to spend.

                    i am on holiday at the moment, but have posted this to help
                    someone out with a tvr:
"hi. i've posted this on piston heads also.
this is going to be a strange request, but hope
                    someone out there can help us.
my wifes best friend has just had her brother die
                    suddenly in bed at 62. he owned what we believe was a tvr
                    3000m. he took the car to a garage to have some work done on
                    it about 3 weeks before he died and his wife doesn't know
                    which garage and as yet she hasn't found the cars log book
                    or any paperwork for the car. i remember seeing it once,
                    about 5 years ago and it was black with some stress cracking
                    around the body. he lived in farnham, surrey, near
                    guildford. 
so does anyone living near there or who used a tvr
                    garage near farnham know of a black car sitting around
                    gathering dust where the garage can't get hold of the owner?
any help would be gratefully appreciated to save
                    this
                    car and at the moment his wife needs it back to grieve and
                    deal with his sudden death"
if anyone out there knows the
                    whereabouts of this tvr, please email tvr@m-fix.co.uk
                    and i will pass on your contact details to the person
                    concerned. many thanks. note on
                        24th august 2010 - this car has now been found, many
                        thanks to those of you who have emailed in your
                        findings.

                    i'm currently digging out the old film negatives from my
                    restoration photos to transfer to digital images - will
                    update the complete site once it's done as they will be much
                    more detailed and less grainy than the scanned pics you may
                    have seen in places on the site. also they will have a large
                    size option so you can see more detail. i'm also working on
                    some products now - all will be revealed in a few weeks! 

                    technical questions area updated, plus wap site for members
                    being updated with more useful data for "at the roadside"
                    assistance. also a new addition to the gallery - an essex
                    engined hot rod with nice close up view of its holley carb
                    for anyone wishing to know what the conversion looks like.

                    many thanks to james collier for the following information
                    regarding suspension on his 3000m:
"i've just replaced all the rear
                    upper and lower wishbone bushes on the 3000m with the tr6
                    front lower inboard bushes. as mentioned on your site the
                    studs which hold the lower outer bushes were ceased into the
                    upright. however i did mange to replace the bushes without
                    the hassle of removing the studs. i removed the nut and
                    washer and then carefully drilled out the rubber, which in
                    turn enabled me to remove the bush sleeve. now with a
                    liberal amount of bush grease i was able to push the new
                    bushes into the wishbone housing over the stud using a pair
                    of large adjustable pliers.
i thought that your readers would like to know that
                    this can be done, without the hassle of drilling, machining
                    and crack checking the uprights.
i also have koni part number for the shocker
                    absorbers: 80-2365. 
i also replaced the anti roll bar bushes. the
                    inboard ones are from a triumph herald anti roll bar and the
                    outer ones are a triumph herald front lower wishbone bush
                    which has to be shortened.
i hope this helps others out when doing similar
                    jobs. "

                    new for may 2009 is the m-fix youtube video channel - i have
                    just posted a couple of test movies from my phone taken this
                    week - take a look here: 

http://www.youtube.com/tvrmfix

more testing has taken place this
                    week, and more to come. carbs synchronised now, jetting is
                    good but fine tuning taking the time. i'm trying to get an
                    economical cruise along with good power for maximum
                    acceleration. seems to be working well and i'm amazed at how
                    far out things have been. i will have to re-write the
                    members area in the carb tuning section as i feel like i've
                    just been studying for an exam for the last year! working on
                    making a throttle position sensor as another variable has
                    reared its ugly head - i.e. varying mixture depending on
                    throttle position at the same engine rpm's!
work continued this week on the
                    triple weber setup - perfection is painstaking but worth it
                    in the end. i hope to come up with a 'good' fuel consumption
                    on cruise, as well as a great full power setup. without the
                    aid of my air/fuel test equipment this would be impossible.
                    will be creating a vastly updated section on this once
                    completed. after that, the final tuning is the distributor
                    advance curve adjustment, possibly the only thing i need a
                    rolling road to do for me but still working on another
                    method of doing this!

                    new gallery photos added, t slot wheels for sale - check it
                    out in the marketplace.

                    the trip over the berkshire downs was a good test of the
                    fuel setup & i worked out the average fuel consumption
                    was 20mpg, not bad considering the fairly high average speed
                    on the a roads. there is still a bad hesitation when on very
                    slight throttle and when accelerating mildly...this is going
                    to be a new challenge. also still some popping back through
                    the carbs. the standard brakes were only just able to stop
                    the car as required so the 4 pot upgrade is imminent. more
                    work will take place next week (after easter) to fit a set
                    of new safety belts. full report & new section will
                    appear as soon as it's done.



                    spring fast approaching. the 3000m is off on its first trip
                    of 2009 this weekend, i hope to provide a report of the day
                    along with some mpg figures (or mpl) for those interested in
                    the thirst of a 3.1 v6 essex with triple dcnf's!
 managed to finally set the rear
                    wheel alignment to more or less factory setting 0�20' toe-in
                    now i have a set of tracking gauges. the alignment was found
                    to be 0�30' toe-out after using a basic method of alignment
                    after the restoration. it goes to show how innacurate any
                    method can be rather than using the correct tools. of course
                    the factory (or tr6) alignment settings are a good starting
                    point but small alterations may provide better directional
                    stability once further road testing can be carried out. the
                    front tracking was also checked & found to be exactly to
                    spec - must have been doing something right when i set that
                    up. note the rear toe-in adjustment also affects the camber
                    - more toe-in increases the camber quite noticeably. not yet
                    checked it but it appears to be about 2� negative now, will
                    report on that in the next week.
i have also just modified the
                    3000m's wiper arms to allow the fitment of new style wiper
                    blades. these are the ones you see on cars such as the
                    renault scenic 2, espace iv, modus etc. ebay sellers do a
                    pair of 14" blades for under �20 gbp so i have bought a pair
                    to test. initial findings are that the clips to attach them
                    to the arms are rubbish & not fit for the purpose,
                    however the actual blades seem reasonably good. the driver's
                    wiper blade still won't work on the extreme right hand side
                    of the screen due to its curvature, and the new blades
                    showed up the weak springs on the wiper arms. i removed the
                    wiper arm spring and shortened it making the arm press
                    against the screen much harder, but still allowing the
                    wipers to operate well. now at last the screen is cleared
                    just like on a modern car - a first! i will move this info
                    & add some pictures into a new section in the next few
                    days.

                    still wanting ideas for remanufactured parts - i am
                    arranging some batches of parts to be made in the autumn and
                    so far have had a request for 3000s door window frames
                    complete.

                    new essex v6 product!

winter was 'ere (for once)!

the cold weather has shown that
                    it's easy to forget we have winters here in the uk...but
                    "when i was a lad" they were worse (or better in some
                    cases!) than this year...i think it's just sad that more
                    cars aren't fitted with limited slip differentials. not that
                    i wanted to take out the 3000m in it (no lsd on this one
                    either).....

                    front wheel drive cars are a struggle with lsd's anyway,
                    that's why they are normally found on 4x4's or rear wheel
                    drive cars only. if one driven wheel spins on the snow/ice
                    on a non lsd equipped car then you are stuck as the other
                    doesn't move. with an lsd the differential transfers the
                    drive to the other side, thus making traction better in
                    difficult conditions. for track use it does the same thing,
                    and of course means you go forward quicker rather than
                    burning rubber. the downside is higher stresses in the
                    differential, therefore and lsd is normally beefed up
                    considerably.

still not done, but clearer photos
                    will be replacing some of the old photos on this site very
                    soon due to a new piece of kit i have which allows high
                    quality digital copies of my old 35mm photos from the
                    1990's...will keep you informed as this happens.

                    more wanted adverts this week - please see below for an
                    opportunity to get a special tvr badge:

                    "i looked around on the net to find a textile badge
                    identical to our m series bonnet badge (to be put on a cap).
                    i found a company who can make them from a picture of the
                    badge, puts it in the computer, and makes badges. now the
                    problem is that a one-off would cost me �100. is there any
                    of you who would be interested too, so we can split the
                    cost? let me know, i�m happy to coordinate all this. contact

                    jan 7th 2009
                    at last! happy new year and welcome to the m-fix tvr website
                    to all, including the new members. new additions to the
                    technical questions section have been added this week.

                    again my mobile car repair work has taken up most of my time
                    recently, with some interesting work on a chimaera involving
                    the central locking "black box" controller. rather than fit
                    a new cdl/immobiliser setup i have decided to go down the
                    diagnostic route, and have got involved in some serious
                    electronics including microprocessor reprogramming and
                    creating a wiring diagram to allow the complete system to be
                    checked. more to follow once complete.

                    i am also looking into getting some hard to find tvr parts
                    remanufactured in the autumn of 2009 so please email me here
                    with any requests/ideas you have regarding this.

                    nec classic car show 2008

                    i visited this show today (friday 14th nov). nice to see a
                    couple of granturas & a vixen there - no m series cars
                    however so may try to get the 3000m into the next show once
                    it's complete. the show was larger than in previous years,
                    taking up 4 halls & there were a great selection of rare
                    classics were on display.

                    i have added a new section at last! see members area,
                    clutches, added to assist when deciding whether to change
                    your clutch. also notes on sizes and i.d. markings to make
                    purchasing a new clutch possible without stripping out the
                    old one first.

                    things have been busy at work during the last month so
                    updates have been delayed. finally sorted out my desk &
                    members area will now start to be filled with some very
                    useful tuning data, just need a day to get it all written.

8th sept 2008 - 3000m shells on
                    ebay uk - only 1 day to go before end of bidding! only a
                    couple of bids so far - don't miss out on this very rare
                    opportunity! all from the same seller. note this sale is not
                    related to my website in any way, i just spotted it last
                    night while surfing! see links below:
1972 3000m bodyshell
3000m bodyshell - front end damaged but
                      rear half ok. also has fold back roof (unredeemable the ad
                      says) but maybe could be rebuilt like i have done? -
                    sold for only �10.50!

3000m door aperture alloy gutters

                    new on the links page is the tvr car club italia. looking on
                    the site there's a very interesting turismo (tour) around
                    the chianti valley - check it out here! would be a great
                    place to take your tvr on some of the best roads &
                    scenery in the world.

                    welcome to the new members in the last couple of weeks -
                    quite a few new ones as i guess it was the holiday season
                    & time for some repairs! 

                    new service available to tvr s owners (i.e. s1-s4, not the
                    3000s) to test/repair your electronic speedometer & test
                    the speedo transducer. pricing & details to appear very
                    shortly on my business website - www.m-fix.co.uk

work continuing on fuel jetting.


                    air/fuel calibration now underway with the 3000m, therefore
                    at last correct carb jetting can be carried out. initial
                    tests show a mixture that's far too rich on both
                    acceleration & cruising. should be able to save a few
                    ���'s on fuel now & get rid of the power loss between
                    1850 & 2500 rpm. full report to commence in members area
                    in next few days with graphs, explanations etc.

                    taimar spares!
                    shame to see it but a good number of rare spares available
                    on this taimar shell/chassis that is on ebay. item has been
                    relisted. click here.

                    click here

                    i am going to try to attend the tvrcc track days this year
                    (see dates below), hopefully running the 3000m once i've
                    sorted the exhaust (now in progress), jetting fine tuning,
                    modified brakes, new wheels/tyres. just about to purchase an
                    air/fuel diagnostic setup for on the road fine tuning, may
                    be of interest to owners of older tvrs out there without
                    fuel injection. i have also been doing more & more work
                    on chimaera models recently so am happy to quote for work on
                    newer tvrs (if under 15k value) now as they are not all that
                    different to the old ones!

monday 28th april - castle combe
                    (99db noise limit) - i attended but not in the tvr due to
                    ongoing work.

                    tuesday 27th may - cadwell park (105db noise limit) -

                    appear on this page.

april is here so time to get the
                    car work started again (in-between my usual mobile car work
                    - http://www.m-fix.co.uk)
                    

rss feed address changed - it may
                    be wise to re-subscribe to this service as i've moved it to
                    a server that supports rss feeds correctly (the old one
                    didn't causing problems).

                    new wanted advert - someone needs a set of triple weber
                    carbs, inlet manifold & possibly a set of air filters
                    for a v6 essex. please see marketplace wanted ads.

                    gallery updated, technical questions updated this week. 

                      spring is just round the corner, so it's time to check
                    your tvr over ready for the nice weather.


engine - check all levels,
                      drain/flush/renew as necessary. check cooling system for
                      leaks, and make sure the otter switch is working for your
                      radiator fan. check the radiator fins are unblocked &
                      straight, and that the water pump doesn't have a load of
                      crusty deposits under the spindle hole. if so the seals
                      are worn and the pump could start to leak especially on
                      hot days/long journeys.

                      gearbox & diff - check for oil leaks & make sure
                      the levels are correct - can be tricky to check on some
                      models.

                      tyres - check for damage to the sidewalls & tread
                      (don't forget to check the inside tyre wall too!).
suspension/steering - jack up
                      each wheel and check for play in the wheel
                      bearings/suspension/steering, and spin the wheel to listen
                      for any roughness in the bearing, as sometimes there can
                      be no play but the wheel bearing's surface can be pitted.
                      rear wheels difficult to spin due to drivetrain. while
                      you're there check over the tyre treads for embedded
                      nails/screws etc. check also the steering column top bush
                      hasn't got any play by holding the steering wheel at 12
                      & 6 o'clock and pull/push with alternate hands.
brakes - check the pads &
                      shoes - replace pads if under about 4mm, shoes if under
                      2mm. while drums are off, check the wheel cylinders aren't
                      seeping under the rubber dust cover. de-rust the discs
                      before using to save the pads from contamination. adjust
                      handbrake if necessary & check correct operation.
                      check cables aren't rubbing on the half shafts and if so
                      move them away using a cable tie.
drivetrain - grease up the half
                      shaft & propshaft uj's if fitted with a grease nipple
                      and check for excess movement in all joints. check half
                      shaft central gaiters aren't split or loose.

                      windscreen & wipers - if the car's not been garaged,
                      the windscreen wipers may have ice damage - replace them
                      if necessary. top up the screenwash and adjust/unblock the
                      washer jets if necessary.
lights - check all work ok after
                      extended winter use. tap each lamp unit while they are on
                      in case a bulb filament is about to separate. may save you
                      getting a ticket next time you drive at night.

                      locks & hinges - use some light oil or spray grease to
                      lubricate moving parts. check the bonnet catches work
                      properly & are secure as the fibreglass can sometimes
                      split around these.

                    savvy enough these days! this is the rss feed system, which
                    means you will get updates automatically each time i post a
                    new message/blog there as long as you opt in using your
                    browser. it saves a lot of typing for me! any problems with

                    the new m-fix workshop manual version 1.0 is still being
                    prepared for first issue. latest news on the release date is
                    now first half of 2008 - my business work has meant
                    unforseen delays. however, the manual will include all of
                    the information, photos, data etc available in the members
                    area, and will be available from the online shop. updates
                    will be available as and when deemed necessary. update packs
                    will be available to allow previous versions of the manual
                    to be updated. news of the launch will appear both on the
                    m-fix rss feed, and the homepage here.

                    things have been busy since the last update, so i am finally
                    getting round to some more much needed improvements to the
                    3000m. vented front brake conversion, new wheels/tyres, fine
                    tuning of the triple webers are all on the way. not to
                    mention getting round to sorting out the seats and interior
                    trims. all of this means some interesting new articles for
                    the website, and also the publishing of the first edition of
                    the m-fix technical manual. i have been working on a v8s
                    recently - body off chassis repairs, engine diagnostics,
                    interior electrics, also have serviced a chimaera 4.0.
                    anyone else interested in some tvr related work please get
                    in touch - see below for details. 

                    i am now able to do work on a mobile basis - please see the
                    new website for details here: www.m-fix.co.uk
rates are really suited to local work however, but i'm
                    willing to travel outside the area shown if you need
                    assistance on your tvr. i specialise in electronic
                    diagnostics and have a rover v8 14cux dianostic tool, so am
                    able to fault find most v8 tvrs now.

                    again 26th sept - new wanted adverts for 3000s and 3000m
                    parts - see marketplace section or click here

                    work is continuing on the first hardcopy manual which will
                    be available for purchase. this means a load of extra work
                    to get into some sort of useful format, so please bear with
                    me, it's still in progress. 


                      tvr car club oxfordshire region - karting endurance race
                      at shennington kart track

it was a wild afternoon, with 11 teams of 3, each
                    driver getting two 15 minute stints as the driver. the track
                    is one of the best in the uk and the karts are twin engined
                    - which makes the racing much more fun as the speed can
                    reach around 40mph. the weather was hot & sunny so the
                    grip was at its best, the tyres only losing grip on the
                    chicane and the two hairpins. photos to follow, but if
                    you're interested in karting then check out the shennington
                    kart racing club at:

                      tvr car club oxfordshire region meeting for august 2007
a good turn out again this month,
                    the weather being kind to make it a great evening in the car
                    park looking at the cars, approx. 15 tvrs this time. if you
                    wish to attend, the meetings are at the foxcombe inn hotel
                    at boars hill on the first thursday of the month. for
                    further info see the tvrcc oxford region website at http://www.tvrccoxford.co.uk
 
                    some updates coming up this for 1600m engine data etc to the
                    members area. data is still currently being collated but
                    will appear soon. 
remember this question?
                    does anyone know what make glass sunroof was fitted to the
                    taimar? also can you tell me what vehicle it was originally
                    fitted to? 
                    many thanks to john simpson - he has provided the answer -
                    it was a tudor webasto sunroof. 
just spotted this on youtube - an m series tvr
                    video - not sure but looks like it's a uk owned car. i guess
                    someone needed to get out the house at christmas going by
                    the title...
new item in store - gearbox gasket
                    set for 4 speed ford gearboxes fitted to the 3000m and essex
                    v6 engines (3 litre).

tvr car club oxfordshire meeting 7th june 2007
i took the 3000m to the oxfordshire
                    meeting this week - there were 22 other cars there including
                    a prototype 3000s which has no boot! it was apparently used
                    by the hood makers for tvr and so is a unique model. see a
                    couple of pic's below:



                    i have decided to expand the wanted & for sale adverts
                    to cover all models of classic tvr i.e. any model up to and
                    including the s models. this is due to the coverage this
                    website is now getting thanks to years of being online - so
                    i hope it will help anyone who owns an old tvr find a rare
                    part, or sell their car to an enthusiast and not a time
                    waster. send any adverts you wish to display using the
                    contact link at in the menu bar.

                    3000m rolling road session report now viewable in members
                    section - see technical manual, engine, v6 essex for the
                    report (members area only).

                    it was arranged by the tvrcc cotswold 3
                    counties...interesting range of cars were there including a
                    tvr typhon. the power & torque curve is shown so you can
                    see what was recorded, an see how much a triple carb setup
                    produces along with the other mods. 



 
can you help a 3000m/s owner track
                    down a spare roof/frame assembly? or perhaps suggest parts
                    from donor vehicles that can be modified? if so please see
                    the wanted ad's page.
for may there were additions to the
                    new section on mot emissions test procedure (to help those
                    of you who do your own tuning to understand how the test
                    centre measures your car's emissions). also is a new article
                    on core plug removal which has been my latest challenge this
                    week.
 i am now self employed again and
                    once my 'work vehicle' is ready to roll i will offer a
                    call-out repair/advice service to owners of tvr & essex
                    engined vehicles. not yet sure on extent of area covered but
                    hope i can offer something that's of help to most people in
                    the uk. it's planned to be a home visit service where you
                    can book a visit to help you sort out a problem with your
                    car, to carry out some maintenance, mot preparation or
                    pre-mot check, or just for a helping hand with some heavier
                    jobs such as lifting off your bodyshell etc. there's the
                    possibility of a telephone helpline where you can reach me
                    when you need to talk about a car problem rather than wait
                    for an email reply, however this has possible legal
                    implications so i am seeking advice before going ahead. i am
                    going through the many survey replies received in the past 4
                    years to see what else i can offer with this new venture,
                    including offering work/advice on other tvr models. please
                    feel free to drop me a line if anything mentioned above is
                    of particular interest.
 while i will offer the mobile
                    service initially, i am in the process of checking out some
                    local workshops as i feel this is the only real way to offer
                    a good service to you in terms of mechanical work. if this
                    is possible, it will be in banbury, oxfordshire or the
                    immediate surrounding area, although not yet sure if
                    feasable due to the crazy costs involved and lack of small
                    workshops in the area.
the above work means i will be
                    working full-time on this business, therefore expect many
                    new articles, photos and even streaming videos to appear
                    once this has begun! also due to popular request i will
                    finally be producing the m series technical manual in
                    hardcopy which will be available for purchase.

thanks to chris gale for answering
                    the question on suspension from earlier this month. (i have
                    a 1971 2500 and i have just replaced the front shocks and
                    springs. i would like to replace the 4 rear springs. any
                    idea what weight they should be?). see his answer in
                    technical questions - suspension.
finally i got round to testing the
                    car to see if all the tweaks to the triple carbs and
                    camshaft have finally sorted out the problem with high
                    hydrocarbons (hc). i'm glad to report that it now sails
                    through the mot requirements but has to be fully warmed up
                    (i.e. cooling fan must have cut in a couple of times before
                    testing). full update in 40dcnf section in members only
                    area! some updates to the technical questions have been
                    added this week also.

other updates to members area for
                    march - mainly to make printing of the technical pages
                    easier. also a new technical question has been added. for

new wap site now live for members.
                    this will allow you to have technical data available to your
                    mobile phone, allowing you to look up important info. at any
                    time - e.g when you need to check your tyre pressures, have
                    the tracking/camber checked etc. work is continuing on this
                    new side of the website.

                    new site map being compiled to make browsing easy with non
                    java menus useful for those without suitable browser or hand
                    held personal organisers. see lower down this page on the
                    right for the current menus available in text, and remember
                    to use your browsers back key until pages have been modified
                    to allow navigation to other pages to be possible. java menu
                    will still be shown as is much more useful to 80% of users.
                  
the cam replacement/timing section
                    in the members area is now fully updated, and i'm currently
                    working carb jetting, now getting closer to a nice
                    sounding/running engine at last. sorry for delays as i have
                    had to spend a lot of time sorting various things out with
                    the camshaft work. spitting carb problem sorted now also. i
                    am now in the process of sorting out the engine breathing
                    system now, by fitting an oil catch tank which will vent out
                    to somewhere at the back of the car - putting an end to
                    fumes entering the car and making my clothes smell.
 i am currently sorting out the
                    poor running/mot nightmare on the m-fix 3000m due to triple
                    carbs and a road/rally spec cam (kent v62). i have changed
                    the cam to a milder spec (kent v63 fast road). the update to
                    the technical manual for in-car cam changes, plus setting
                    the cam timing correctly using offset woodruff keys is now
                    available. the new cam is from a blank rather than
                    reprofiled and allows the steel timing gear dot to line up
                    with the crankshaft dot - explaining why the last cam forced
                    the dot to be 1 tooth out when timing in the cam. reground
                    cams are offset more due to the regrinding of the lobes
                    being altered in overlap etc. it is a bit of a chore to set
                    the cam up but quite straightforward once used to it.

wanted ads - see if you have
                    something sitting in your garage that could help out a
                    fellow tvr owner.

                    membership fee to help cover the associated costs of running
                    the whole site (larger than you would imagine), and to help
                    with future projects. the members site has no adverts as we
                    think they just get in the way of the important stuff.
                    subscriptions are available for 1 month, and now a
                    discounted quarterly and 6 monthly option. for costs see

from august: members area
                    new information available: adjustment of rear wheel
                    bearings. more technical questions as usual. i am currently
                    spending some time looking into a running fault which has
                    reared its ugly head again, almost certainly to do with non
                    motorcraft (ford) parts for the engine....more on this very
                    soon. traced it (partly) to the cap, but also worn
                    distributor spindle bearing at base of distributor. the
                    bearing had worn enough to let the pressure of the cam gear
                    alter the centre position of the rotor arm, allowing it to
                    cut away the ht contacts inside the cap on no.'s 1, 4 and 2.
                    still getting the odd misfire now after fitting a new bosch
                    type non vacuum distributor from aldon, but at least all 6
                    cylinders are working.

i have just discovered a company supplying goodridge
                      hoses for the m series & classic tvrs:

                      castle combe tvrcc track day 2003

also new is a downloadable tvr m series buyer's guide,
                    wiring diagram download, windscreen & rear screen
                    removal/refitting, bonnet quick release mod, new gallery
                    photo, bodywork tools update still in progress (more photos
                    & info), new tech questions appearing regularly...latest
                    one includes a downloadable sketch of safety belt mount
                    plates.
the new site's running pretty
                    smoothly now, with plenty more work needed to keep me busy.
                    i'm trying to get all the sections finished, and still
                    maintaining a fast response to technical questions (same day
                    replies in most cases). keep them coming in - each one then
                    goes onto the website so in time it will become a useful
                    source of help to others. 
please bear in mind that some of
                    the sections require a lot of scanning of photos which is
                    pretty time consuming - so i have to find spaces in my busy
                    schedule to get them transferred to digital.

claims to fame!
seen any "famous" people while driving recently? in late
                    2005 i pulled up behind a car with a number plate m0r 15y -
                    and none other than morrissey (ex smiths lead singer) was
                    driving it. he was a good safe driver from what i saw!
                    wasn't driving a tvr though......

                    additional note march 2007 - in response to a thread in a
                    morrissey chat forum last year, i really did see him in this
                    car in warwick, uk driving on the main road through the town
                    centre. could have been a tribute band singer though, as you
                    know what they are like...but i am almost 100% certain it
                    was the real one! by the way thanks for the extra website
                    traffic you are generating for me :op so here is my link to
                    you: http://forums.morrissey-solo.com



what is the technical library?

                  basically an owner's workshop manual on-line. information is
                  free to view, providing both standard maintenance procedures
                  along with trade "secrets" - to allow you, the owner, to
                  decide whether you want to attempt any work yourself. 



                    performance tuning/modifications - get the best from your
                    engine & gearbox.


 



track day tips - how to pass the
                    noise test, avoid mishaps, prepare for extra stress on your
                    tvr.

chassis preparation, repairs,
                    shotblasting, painting, stripdown & rebuild etc etc.
                    more pages appearing weekly.

 although the spare parts service is
                    not yet operational, we would welcome any emails listing
                    parts which you think are especially hard to find or know
                    can no longer be bought new - to weigh up the level of
                    interest & range of stock required to allow an on-line
                    parts service to commence (use survey form above to tell
                    us).
these cars, although quite rare and
                  of alternative construction to mass produced vehicles of their
                  time are not as difficult to work on as you may think....so
                  please have a look and see for yourself!
