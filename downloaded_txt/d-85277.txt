why












the all-girl advantage cannot be denied.
"girls' schools should not be judged by the absence of boys, but rather by the presence – the self-assurance, poise, and derring-do – of the girls themselves." – international coalition of girls' schoolswe are incredibly passionate about this subject, the product of nearly 200 years of educating girls. at viz, our educational philosophy perfectly balances our spiritual philosophy, creating intelligent and mature women of substance and character. your viz sisters provide a daily dose of inspiration, lifting you up and encouraging you to be the individual you want to be.while we could go on and on about the unparalleled benefits of an all-girl education, the international coalition of girls' schools (icgs) provides ample proof. check it out.













immediate connections.
whether you come to viz in kindergarten, sixth grade, or as a freshman, once you walk through the doors, you are valued, and you are loved. small class sizes allow teachers to fully know and understand their students, creating customized learning experiences that enable each student to fulfill her unique potential.our salesian spirituality, which emphasizes kindness, gentleness, humility, and thoughtful concern for others, creates a welcoming atmosphere that fosters lifelong friendships.













opportunity. opportunity. opportunity.
are you a hardworking student who enjoys soccer and programming robots? committed to your academic studies but also love being on stage and have a keen interest in the judicial process? or maybe you aren't 100% sure where your interests lie and want the chance to explore.academically, athletically, artistically, spiritually, socially, emotionally, philanthropically, and so on. opportunities abound at viz. take them and make them your own.













there is only one measure of success.
at viz, student success is the only success that matters. for our faculty, teaching is not a job; it is a vocation, one they take very seriously. they are committed to working with students in class and frequently outside of class to ensure they are fully prepared and confident as they face their next assignment, their next year in school, and beyond.at the middle and upper school levels, this includes counselors dedicated to supporting students as they progress through their viz journey. when they are ready to move on to college, our upper school counseling team is hands-on, helping students evaluate options and select the college that will allow them to continue to be who they are and be that well.













oh, the places you will go!
we could tell you about our commitment to and reputation for academic excellence, but we think you would rather see the outcome. year after year, viz graduates gain acceptance to a wide range of leading universities and colleges across the country and around the globe.our 5000+ amazing alums and counting have taken the knowledge, skills, and virtues gained during their years at viz and applied them to achieve success in diverse careers.
