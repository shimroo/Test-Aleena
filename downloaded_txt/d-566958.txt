 important announcement

 we are sad to announce that after 77 years the centre for policy on ageing (cpa) is being wound up and has gone into voluntary liquidation.
further news about the charitys legacy to follow. 

the centre for policy on ageing (cpa) has been contributing to the  university college london (ucl) 'topic' research project on 'oral health care in care homes'. the study has looked at oral health care, in care homes in britain and northern ireland, and concludes its work in 2024.

centre for policy on ageing was a founding organisation for the journal ageing & society.
cambridge university press, the journal's publishers are currently pointing to 2023 gerontology highlights from this and some of their other journals.

what is a fair level for the state pension and, given future projected demographic change and current pension indexing policies, how can the government support that pension?
this  institute for fiscal studies report explores the challenges and suggests possible solutions. 
 for more information see the cpa policies on ageing web pages.

phoenix insights has published a survey and report which finds that 4.6 million people in the uk [15% of those saving with a 'defined contribution' (dc) pension scheme], expect a retirement income less than the ' minimum retirement living standard', while 12.4 million people [40% of dc savers] are not on track to receive the minimum income they expect.
 for more information see the cpa policies on ageing web pages.

the institute for fiscal studies has published a report indicating that the increase in the state pension age from 65 to 66 pushed down the net income, from all sources, of 65-year-olds by an average of £108 per week while boosting public finances by around £4.9 billion per year.
 for more information see the cpa policies on ageing web pages.

carers week is an annual campaign to raise awareness of caring, highlight the challenges unpaid carers face and recognise the contribution they make to families and communities throughout the uk. further details.
the uk government has published build back better, its plans for health and social care in england. the social care proposals include, from october 2023, an £86,000 lifetime cap on care costs (excluding accommodation). the proposals will be funded by measures including a 1.25% increase in national insurance contributions, which from april 2023, will become a separate, notionally hypothecated, charge on earned income, the health and social care levy. 
the westminster government has also published a white paper, outlining its 10 year plan for adult social care reform in england.
for more detailed information, and updates, see the cpa policies on ageing web pages.

more recent updates have set the cost of accommodation, nationally, at a notional £200 per week.
  
 the triple lock, a uk government guarantee to increase the state pension in line with prices, earnings or 2.5%, whichever is greatest, was introduced in 2010 to begin to offset a historic decline in the absolute and relative purchasing power of the state pension. this guarantee is particularly important at a time of financial difficulty. the uk government's own figures show that, when compared with average earnings, although improving since 2010, the value of the state pension is still historically low. the guarantee is a manifesto commitment and breaking this commitment would adversely affect pensioner incomes. using the current exceptional times as a reason to scrap the earnings link could be seen as a knee jerk reaction, losing sight of the reasoned, longer-term, objective. for further information on the triple lock see the cpa policies on ageing web pages.
[on 7th september 2021 the uk government announced that it would exclude earnings from the pension guarantee, for one year, on the grounds that a statistical anomaly in earnings, caused by covid pandemic measures, would have led to an 8% rise in pensions]

october 1st 2020 is the 30th anniversary of the united nations international day of older persons. as the world continues to battle with the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic, and many countries enter a second wave, the un secretary-general antónio guterres, sends a message.

although older people are no more likely to catch the coronavirus, covid-19, than anyone else, the disease has a more damaging effect in older age as the greater prevalence of other health conditions and a weaker immune system lead to a lower level of resilience. 
the group of 'clinically vulnerable people', advised to 'stay at home as much as possible', includes all older people aged 70 and over. 
 the cpa policies on ageing web page includes links to the uk government's current plans for england and other useful guidance on how to deal with the disease. 

older people in care homes, because of their age and poor health, are among those most at risk from the coronavirus covid-19. two ons reports released on 3rd july 2020 highlight the issue. a   survey of care homes finds that over one half (56%) of care homes in england have reported at least one confirmed case of coronavirus. 
 a second report of  deaths of care homes residents in england and wales for the period to 20th june 2020 shows one third of male deaths and one quarter of female deaths in care homes were associated with coronavirus. the 19,394 deaths of care home residents made up around 43% of all coronavirus deaths.
 ons have also produced a useful blog covid-19 and the impact on social care.


the united nations have issued a policy brief the impact of covid-19 on older persons, which aims to:  ensure that difficult health-care decisions affecting older people are guided by a commitment to dignity and the right to health; strengthen social inclusion and solidarity during physical distancing; fully integrate a focus on older persons into the socio-economic and humanitarian response to covid-19; and expand participation by older persons, share good practices and harness knowledge and data.

this latest seminar, on thursday 26th june 2014, from the centre for ageing and biographical studies (cabs) at the open university and the centre for policy on ageing (cpa), looked at the issues involved in multi/inter-disciplinary research.
gerontology has long been seen as an area for multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research essential to the understanding of human ageing with specific institutional examples of collaborative working since the 1980s.
    the more complex issue of inter-disciplinary work, where approaches are integrated rather than viewed separately, has raised a number of obstacles. 
this seminar  heard from those who have been part of this history, and brought together social gerontologists and experts from the arts, humanities and design/ergonomics to address a variety of questions.
speakers included: professor catherine hennessy (plymouth university); professor miriam bernard (keele university) and professor sheila peace (the open university)
programme; registration and further details. 
the seminar also saw the the launch of imagining futures, the latest in the representation of older people in ageing research series from from the centre for ageing and biographical studies at the open university and the centre for policy on ageing. 

age and ageing are, in part, cultural and social constructs. the ways in which individuals, and the societies they live in, perceive and portray age and ageing affect how we understand and respond to an ageing population.
this one-day conference on 28th april 2014, organised jointly by the british library, centre for policy on ageing and queen mary college, brought together experts from different backgrounds to share and discuss, the many ways in which age and ageing are portrayed and understood and how insights from research can be translated into policy and practice.
speakers included julia twigg, from the university of kent at canterbury; debora price from the institute of gerontology at kings college, london; and angus hanton, co-founder of the intergenerational foundation.
view further details. 
cpa would like to thank all those involved for a very successful conference.

the centre for policy on ageing has joined with age uk, anchor, independent age, the international longevity centre uk,and the joseph rowntree foundation to form the ready for ageing alliance.
the purpose of the alliance is to urge the government and all political parties to face up to the major changes and challenges from our rapidly ageing society following the report of the house of lords select committee on public service and demographic change (see below).
for further information see the press release to mark the launch of the alliance.
on 3rd may 2013 the alliance sent an open letter to the prime minister, the rt hon david cameron mp, seeking a positive response from government to the house of lords ready for ageing report. the government response was published on 18th july.
for further information see the cpa 'policies on ageing' web page.

the house of lords select committee on public service and demographic change's ready for ageing? report highlights the lack for preparedness in government, public services and the financial sector for future increases in longevity and the corresponding ageing of the uk population. the committee draws a number of conclusions and makes recommendations for action both before and after the 2015 general election. for further information see the cpa policies on ageing page. 

the alzheimer's society report, low expectations, released on 26th february 2013 reveals that up to 80% of care home residents may have dementia and highlights the low expectations that people have for the residential care of people with dementia,the centre for policy on ageing's profile of residents in bupa care homes also throws light on the prevalence of dementia in care homes and how this is changing over time. the cpa report updates cpa's earlier report on the changing role of care homes which summarised developments in residential and nursing home care historically and to 2009. for further information see our policies on ageing page. 

on 11th february 2013 the government announced its response to the dilnot commission's proposals for the funding of social care with measures to be implemented from april 2017. the centre for policy on ageing welcomes the acceptance by the government of the principle of the dilnot commission report that there should be a cap on later life social care costs that have to be met by the individual. cpa also welcomes the raising of the threshold for support to £123,000 so that more older people on low income can receive financial support. it is hoped that over time, and as the economic  situation allows, the cap of £75,000 at 2017 prices can be reduced, in real terms, to levels closer to those proposed by dilnot. in short, cpa welcomes the principle but not the principal of this announcement.
for further information see our policies on ageing page. cpa is a member of the care and support alliance.


the centre for policy on ageing and the centre for ageing and biographical studies at the open university, on thursday 14th february 2013, are holding seminar 15 in their representations of older people in ageing research seminar series. the seminar, entitled "studies in ageing masculinities: still in their infancy?" will be held at the ou's premises in london.

the centre for policy on ageing's profile of residents in bupa care homes uses data from the 2012 bupa census of its care home residents to provide an up-to-date picture of the current bupa care home population and how that population has changed since earlier censuses in 2003, 2006 and 2009. the report updates cpa's earlier report on the changing role of care homes which summarised developments in residential and nursing home care historically and to 2009.



2012 was the 'european year for active ageing and solidarity between generations' . the main objectives was to promote active ageing in employment; promote active ageing in the community through active citizenship, volunteering and caring; promote active ageing at home through enabling healthy ageing and independent living and enhance cooperation and solidarity between generations.

october 1st 2012 marked uk older people's day. it also marked the full implementation of the ban on age discrimination in the provision of goods and services incorporated in the equality act 2010. with a few notable exceptions, for example in the provision of insurance and other financial services, negative age discrimination in the provision of goods and services can only take place if objectively justified. (see the cpa policies on ageing web page) 
in the run up to the act, the centre for policy on ageing carried out a number of reviews of age discrimination in health and social care in the uk. health and social care services, including the nhs, are not exempt from the provisions of the act.

the centre for policy on ageing (cpa) welcomes the recommendations set out in the independent report by the dilnot commission published on 4th july 2011. the current funding system for adult social care in england is unfair, unduly complex and has been neglected to the point of near collapse.
the commission proposes a 'strong foundation on which to build reform of the social care system' and one where no-one will be expected to lose all their savings and assets in order to fund often unexpected and 'catastrophic' costs of care and support.
cpa urges the government to act quickly and commit to the commission's achievable timetable of a white paper by next spring. 

the centre for policy on ageing was commissioned by bupa to carry out the research for its "keep dancing" report, launched on 10th june 2011.

"care and compassion?", a report from the health ombudsman released on 15th february 2011, outlines 10 cases of poor care of older people in hospital.
 to what extent does this arise from ageism and age discrimination? the centre for policy on ageing has recently published a series of reviews of ageism and age discrimination in health and social care monitoring the evidence and making recommendations.
"how can local authorities with less money support better outcomes for older people?", written by cpa, was launched by the joseph rowntree foundation, as part of its solutions series, on 19th january 2011.
 research shows that older people want and value low-level support - 'that bit of help' but the benefits of investing in this are realised over many years, making it harder to prove impact and protect funding in the face of severe pressure on spending. this review provides examples from across the uk of imaginative, affordable and effective ways of supporting older people's health, well-being, social engagement and independence.
'reflecting on user-involvement and participatory research', the tenth report in the cabs/cpa ageing research series, was launched at the cabs 15th anniversary event on tuesday, 2 november 2010 at the open university.further details are available on the publications and events web pages.
