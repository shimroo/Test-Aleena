testimonials

real people. real moves.









jk moving has renewed my faith in a reliable moving and storage company. i called with less than 24 hours’ notice because of a last-minute predicament, and jk did what i thought was impossible. the movers were great from beginning to end. we will be calling them again without a doubt.

darron w.



i had a great moving experience with jk moving. the load and unload was expertly managed by my driver. the company checked on both days to confirm i was receiving the best service possible. moving to a different state was challenging but jk made getting our stuff there the easy part.

joseph b.



i moved from virginia to florida, and i had a really great experience. the driver/crew leader was awesome, and i am so grateful for his expertise. nothing moved was damaged and honestly, it was one of the best moves i have ever had! thank you, jk moving services!

kristin b.



we had a local move to our new home, and the crew was right on time, very careful with all of our belongings, and really nice throughout the move! they were super-fast and came in below the estimated time too. i would definitely use them again and recommend them!
