disability activists returning to pinellas park, fl"we love our tubes!!"contacts:ndy national-stephen drake and diane coleman(708) 209-1500 ext 11 & 29, (708) 420-0539boston ndy, john kelly (617) 536-5140in florida:disabled queers in action-zan thornton (678) 358-9540rochester adapt/ndy, bruce darling 585 370-6690zen garcia atlanta 678 770 1125michele steger st. louis adapt/ndy 314 229 7435schiavo case: disability rights issue! let people with disabilities be heard"we love our tubes!"disabled activists are demonstrating in florida.disability activists are returning to florida to tell the simple truths about tubes, feeding tubes, breathing tubes, peeing tubes and other tubes we need and love. disabled people in wheelchairs will demonstrate and explain the realities of everyday life with tubes, confronting society's obvious horror and revulsion with our dignity and disability pride.terri's feeding tube is the central issue. this is the reason she is being killed. disability activists must express our ridicule for the pathetic response of the nondisabled majority to these simple pieces of latex rubber. this case hinges on the fact that terri uses a feeding tube, which to disabled people is no big deal - it's just another piece of adaptive equipment. "right now the case is settled, people are thrown back on their own beliefs, while "experts" continue to present the story as a misbegotten political intervention in a private matter," said john kelly of boston not dead yet, "a tragic medical case in which doctors are united in their certain diagnosis that nothing is going on inside her head , and a tragic family matter in which her "husband" really does want the best for her, which is death.  and people agree -- and this is absolutely crucial -- because they themselves would rather be dead thanlike terri schiavo."we have been trained, over and over again, that if we only concealed our differences, tucked that legbag tube - for draining urine -  under the pants leg, never talked about incontinence, that we could be (at least partially) accepted," kelly continued. "but the shame that we are meant to bear keeps us down more effectively than anything that anyone could do to us.""it's time for the press to talk to the real experts on the schiavo case - the disability rights movement", declared diane coleman, president and founder of not dead yet, leading the disability community's opposition to non-voluntary euthanasia for a decade."that's why 26 national disability rights organizations, including groups like not dead yet, and cil's, dqia, and others have adopted a position in support of terri schiavo's right to continue to receive food and water," affirmed stephen drake, research analyst for ndy. "people on the right are killing us slowly with cuts to the budget and medicaid while the people on the left kill us quickly and call it 'compassion' - either way we end up dead - and we object."not dead yet is a national disability rights organization that leads the disability community's efforts to oppose legalization of assisted suicide, euthanasia and other forms of medical killing.website: http://www.notdeadyet.org

	 does my florida governor really need to be reminded of what his duty is in regards to averting terri schiavo's murder? re: his authority
	 
    


my florida governors wants to know what his authority under the law is in regards to him being able to help terri schiavo from being heinously murdered by those who stopped her from being afforded proper rehabilitation and therapy to get her voice back, etc. and substituted false hearsay death wishes which a corrupt court accepted as "clear and convincing": florida constitution article iv section 1. governor.-- (a) ... the governor shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, commission all officers of the state and counties, ... the governor may require information in writing from all executive or administrative state, county or municipal officers upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices. ... (b) the governor may initiate judicial proceedings in the name of the state against any executive or administrative state, county or municipal officer to enforce compliance with any duty or restrain any unauthorized act. ... (d) the governor shall have power to call out the militia to ... execute the laws of the state, ... article i section 2. basic rights.--all natural persons, female and male alike, are equal before the law and have inalienable rights, among which are the right to enjoy and defend life ... no person shall be deprived of any right because of ... physical disability. i also sent the governor a long list of florida statutes that have been violated in terri's case. the list is available at http://www.livejournal.com/~hubbyanddad/.  (it's my own list- and by no means comprehensive.) posted by: tiffany d. at march 4, 2005 02:26 am
