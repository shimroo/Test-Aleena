latest joke
 









in a trial, a southern small-town 
                prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, 
                elderly woman to the stand. he approached her and asked, "mrs. 
                jones, do you know me?"

                she responded, "why, yes, i do know you, mr. williams. i've 
                known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a 
                big disappointment to me. you lie, you cheat on your wife, and 
                you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. 
                you think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to 
                realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit 
                paper pusher. yes, i know you."

                the lawyer was stunned! not knowing what else to do, he pointed 
                across the room and asked, "mrs. jones, do you know the defense 
                attorney?" she again replied, "why, yes, i do. i've known mr. 
                bradley since he was a youngster, too. he's lazy, bigoted, and 
                he has a drinking problem. he can't build a normal relationship 
                with anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the 
                entire state. not to mention he cheated on his wife with three 
                different women. one of them was your wife. yes, i know him."

                the defense attorney almost died.

                the judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a 
                very quiet voice, said, "if either of you idiots asks her if she 
                knows me, i'll send you to the electric chair!"

bonus joke

                a distinguished young woman on a flight from switzerland asked 
                the priest beside her, "father, may i ask a favour?" "of course. 
                what may i do for you?" "well, i bought an expensive woman's 
                electronic hair dryer for my mother's birthday. the dryer is 
                unopened and well over the customs limits; and i'm afraid 
                they'll confiscate it. is there any way you could carry it 
                through customs for me? under your robes perhaps?" "i would love 
                to help you, dear, but i must warn you: i will not lie." 

                "with your honest face, father, no one will question you." when 
                they reached the customs area, she let the priest go ahead of 
                her. the official asked: "father, do you have anything to 
                declare?" "from the top of my head down to my waist, i have 
                nothing to declare." 

                the official thought this answer strange, so asked, "and what do 
                you have to declare from your waist to the floor?" "i have a 
                marvelous instrument designed to be used on a woman, but which 
                is, to date, unused." roaring with laughter, the official said, 
                "go ahead, father." "next."

student guides
 









choosing 
                          a major - your choice of a 
                          major is an important decision. it has both long and 
                          short term consequences that should be examined 
                          carefully in the decision making progress. not only 
                          will your major play a role in your ultimate career 
                          path, it also most immediately determines how you 
                          interact with your college or university as well as 
                          your intellectual development.
                          

                          citing material from the internet 
                          - material found on the internet has it's own unique 
                          difficulties when it comes to using it as a source for 
                          a research paper. our step by step guide helps to 
                          clear up the ambiguities.


                          making classroom presentations 
                          - some classes require that you 
                          give a presentation as a part of classroom 
                          participation or sometimes for extra credit. this can 
                          be intimidating and even frightening to some students, 
                          especially those who are not experienced in public 
                          speaking. we have collected the best information we 
                          could find on the subject, distilled it, added tactics 
                          garnered from our own experience and present it to 
                          you.


                          directives and terms used in writing and test taking - some words are "directives" 
                          used by instructors when they want you to to answer a 
                          question, prepare a report or write a paper in a 
                          particular way. knowing the definitions of these 
                          directives and then presenting the information asked 
                          for in the correct way will help to insure that you 
                          get the grade that your hard work deserves.


                          instructor relations - 
                          getting along with your instructor can have benefits 
                          both in and out of the classroom.


                          reading difficult material - 
                          it's  bound to happen at one time or another. your 
                          instructor assigns a text that is so dense, poorly 
                          written or follows a train of logic that you never got 
                          on. you know that there is information in there that 
                          is important to the subject. you will be required to 
                          discuss it in class, write about it in a paper or, 
                          heaven forbid, understand it well enough to deal with 
                          it on an exam. with that in mind, we have constructed 
                          this step by step guide to help you make sense of 
                          difficult material.


                          using the scientific method
                          - the scientific method is a process for forming and 
                          testing solutions to problems, or theorizing about how 
                          or why things work.  it tries to reduce the influence 
                          of "faith" or bias or prejudice of the experimenter so 
                          that the process is valid anywhere in our world.

                          studying advice -

                          terms of knowledge gained and grades received, its 
                          necessary to spend time studying. in collegiate life

                          student loan consolidation 
                          congress set up the consolidation loans programs to 
                          allow student loan borrowers to combine their loans 
                          into a single new loan with flexible repayment and 
                          extended loan repayment features.

you have a paper to 
                          write. it doesnt matter how many pages it is or what 
                          the topic is, the basics are always the same. 

                          writing a thesis statement - 
                          in most cases the essay or paper you will write for a 
                          college level course will require a thesis statement. 
                          in fact the thesis statement is the foundation of a 
                          quality essay and a necessary component for receiving 
                          the best grade possible.
