					economics & asset values























we address all 
		forms of asset values from multiple perspectives. this includes physical 
		assets, stocks, bonds and all forms of digital assets.  

		i have extensive 
		successful experience in managing a bank as a cfo in the mid 70s and as a ceo since the 
		mid 80s.  this included learning 
		the economics needed to prosper in a bad economy. i outperformed 
		competitors in every poor economy including the high interest rates in 
		the late 70s and early 80s. during this period the frb was silent and 
		never gave guidance. banks like mine needed to track the numbers just 
		like the frb and form our own conclusions. rate changes could happen at 
		any time. 









		the economy today is more comparable to the late 70s and early 80s then 
		the recent great recession of 2008. inflation, higher interest rates, 
		lower real estate prices and asset prices will continue to deteriorate.

featured content november 2022 - asset weakness



















the 
			unprecedented covid economy shutdown, expansive frb monetary 
			policies and excessive fiscal stimulus will result in the 
			worst economy of my lifetime. your 
			home, stocks and many assets are going down in 
			value.  inflation will be worse than many have experienced. 
			unfortunately, inflation will be 
			with us for longer than most expect.
		





		







 when we factor in the work from 
			home phenomenon, the result will be high office vacancy rates, lower 
			office values and more bank problems. 





			the policies described above will lead to stagflation like i saw as a 
bank cfo in the late 70s and early 80s when prime reached about 21%.  i am not saying 21% 
			will be the current cycle high, but it could be.



			 


the 2023 - 2024 opportunity




in addition to banking, fintech (digital finance and technology) have been my life 
			since the early 90s. my focus today is preparing for what i expect to be the 
			worst economy 
		of my life. 

			i have been a fiduciary for my entire banking career (three banks 
			were family owned) and i have been hands on for all types of complex 
			loan pool purchases and real estate workouts since the late 80s. 
			this is unusual for a bank president but the pools were high risk, 
			very profitable and sold at large discounts. more important, it was 
			an opportunity to train staff. this will benefit loan pricing and 
			sales when needed.

the depth of my skills range from manufacturing, 
			automotive, construction, finance (as a cfo) technology, payments, 
			fintech and banking. few can be a qualified receiver for both, a failing construction 
			project and a technology company.

gary lewis evans, principal of
		dfin is always looking for a challenge and is offering problem bank asset management, complex income property loan 
			pool underwriting and managing receiverships as the receiver. this includes bank 
		receiverships or rescues.
		





		


			my broad experience in leadership positions in every bad economic 
			cycle since 1975 is unique in advisors. my due diligence is based 
			upon hands on experience. 
		





		








		i am capable to both advise a bank and provide hands on project 
		leadership or work with regulators on a bank receivership. 





for those that are prepared, their is good news 
		outside of the collapsing 
		physical economy. the digital economy is growing. the metaverse and digital real 
		estate is an opportunity for those that do their homework. 
		metaverse real estate is still a newer product that is experiencing wild 
		swings in value, but i expect metaverse real estate to do well in the long run.  i should mention 
		crypto currency, but i have nothing good to say. one day crypto, stable 
		value currency, will be common and valuable.

					the name was changed to axos in 2018. axos is the most successful and profitable modern digital bank.

project management / consulting - as a long time, hands-on banker that learned the banking fundamentals in the 1970s, i have managed all aspects of a bank since the days when we only had ten key adding machines and minimal computing power. i have been a ceo, cfo, cco and coo in addition to my operating skills, i have led the design and building of deposit and loan processing and servicing platforms that were powered by staff-built rpa. i have extreme banking knowledge and a history of innovation that will benefit a bank seeking the right path in the transition to the metaverse. my skills are adaptable to help banks work with fintech and help fintech better understand banking issues.

non fungible digital asset 
overview

1st time dfin offered for sale





















non fungible physical and digital assets are common 
			and take many forms. physical forms can range from art to real estate. 
digital assets are just that - digital. the monetary value is a function 
of supply and demand. 





most physical and digital non fungible 
assets are of no value and some are very valuable.  the mona lisa and the 
domain amazon.com are very valuable. 

			the us dollar and bitcoin are fungible.  one dollar is the same as 
			another and the same can be said about bitcoin. their is only 1 
			dfin.com or rodeo drive in the world.
