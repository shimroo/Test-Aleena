process engineering software

if you are creating or updating an industrial facility or want to increase production in yours, then epcon’s process engineering software can help. our software models and simulates real-world environments so that you can best understand how your piping system or process unit is running.
with decades of experience, epcon has always been at the forefront of engineering software for piping and pump systems. we’re recognized in our industry, having received major awards in 1990, 1992, 1999, 2001, and 2013. trust us to bring you modeling and simulation solutions.





models and simulations

our software is perfect for the design stage of your facility. we can model your process and utility services to ensure that unit operation and process equipment components are the right size and work the way they should. these models also allow you to find any problems before installing the system so that you can be productive right after start-up.
we are proud to say that at epcon, we were one of the first to create and use fluid flow simulation. these simulations show you what is happening with process and utility systems in your facility to minimize leaks and help ensure design flow to all parts of these systems.
unit operations simulated by epcon international™ include columns and tray or packing internals, reactors, flash drums, compressors, expanders, interchangers, coolers, heaters, pumps, let-down valves, etc. we simulate flow in pipes for liquid and gas 2-phase systems and provide detailed sizing for pipes, pumps, exchangers, flowmeters, relief valves and control valves.







software and more

if you’re not sure what you need for your facility, then contact epcon. our team is ready to find the right solution for you. get in contact with us by calling 800-367-3585 or 281-398-9400. you can also email us about our process engineering software at sales@epcon.com.
