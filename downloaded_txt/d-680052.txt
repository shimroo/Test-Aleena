japanese kokeshi doll




   nations of the world united
                                    in peace 
it seems that
                                    ethnic dolls have been pushed aside in the world of doll collecting, but these dolls are still a great favourite of mine,
                                    they are my "nations of
                                    the world united in peace".  
my collection started many
                                    years ago when i was filled with dreams of travelling to far away places and an intense desire to learn about the people who
                                    lived there. opportunity knocked when i came across a pen pal column in "junior digest", and with address in hand i made my
                                    first trip across the world to japan via the mails. 
through this contact i  acquired
                                    my first doll which was a japanese wooden kokeshi doll. and so, i began a doll collection. each year i added more and more
                                    dolls. my collection became a varied one consisting of national costume, historical, artist, modern, and antique dolls.
personally i prefer
                                    international and regional costume dolls, as our world past and present are recorded in these little dolls, they are a wonderful
                                    teaching tool, history, geography and cultural studies are a never ending fascination to the ethnic doll collector. i
                                    think these very colourful and richly attired dolls deserve more than a second glance.
