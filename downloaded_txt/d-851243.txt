got it up! hurray! now iâ€™m going to finish typing this and go to bed, because iâ€™m sick and need to rest so this cough doesnâ€™t take over.
i have things to do and am going to see what i can get done while i canâ€™t really think about them. one of those things is iâ€™d really like to be able to use my pots and pans and not the cruddy electric skillet. yes, i have an air fryer and a countertop oven, but i canâ€™t cook eggs and bacon (they stick to the electric skillet now) or soup! i want soup!Â  that being said, i have a one item wish list if anyone would like help out there.
apparently weâ€™re getting almost 9 inches of snow here on thursdayâ€¦ ðŸ˜€
thank you for reading, hopefully tomorrow i can draw.

end of year wrapup 
posted on december 11, 2024 by tiffross 


cross posting this, so i donâ€™t forget.
seasons greetings! i hope you all are doing well. iâ€™m trying to get around to various places more frequently than i have. problem is that i donâ€™t have the mental bandwidth to keep up with everything, so iâ€™m concentrating on the important things. getting my sites updating with content.
weâ€™ve had a rough last year and next year isnâ€™t going to be any better, other than iâ€™m at home. right after christmas, i go in to have another set of eye injections, then i schedule the appointment for surgery to correct the issue for good. that being said, i will have health insurance and everything that comes with it, including the privilege of gaining $9k in debt, because i will max out the deductible immediately.
that being said, the actions by my insurance company have already put us in debt that we shouldnâ€™t have. they even had the audacity to raise our rates due to high revolving credit that they were responsible for. they still owe us for almost $5k of hotel costs and honestly, i feel they should reimburse us for the $15k we had to spend to fix our foundation.
iâ€™m planning regular kickstarters to earn funds, but if anyoneâ€™s feeling generous: grocery store gift cards are invaluable. you can message me/post a post here and i can see your email address on my end, and iâ€™ll give you the correct mailing address. i donâ€™t care about fun gifts, because this is going to be a tough year. yeah, i need to rebuild my desktop, but i can get by another year.
grocery stores near us in preferred order based on how far i make it stretch: winco, aldi, tom thumb/market street, kroger, h-e-b, and fiesta.
i am maintaining patreon at the moment, but am exploring other avenues. appears there might be some new plugins that manage things onsite since i never could get patreon to sync files correctly.
i need to double my patreon earnings by next summer when my electric bill skyrockets. i will go in and correct the oversized e-books as well as redo some print books. others iâ€™m leaving alone, because i donâ€™t intend to continue them. those are the cyantian chronicles collections.
