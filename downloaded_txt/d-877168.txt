	 time to say good-bye
	 
    


i am not good at saying good byes. i have done it once before and i deleted my blog because i was ashamed of what i wrote in it. i am not ashamed of my blog. it has been an excellent outlet for me to express myself, my fears and depressed thought. i have met many interesting and nice people. i have made many friendships that i never would have with my blog. i hope to keep them going through e-mail. writing has been theraputic. when i started my blog i was depressed and uncertain as to who i was. b'h all this has changed with my blessing that i find in my finace. frankly i dont have much time to blog. i am busy with college, yeshiva, and my fiance. i now have someone i can talk long hours into the night with instead of reading someone elses words in cyberspace. the relationship that i had with my blog was taken over by my fiance. i no longer need to cry at night to my blog. i have my fiance. for all my loyal readers and anyone who has gained anything by my blog i thank you for your loyal readership and comments. you have enhanced my life immensly. i will leave my blog up for anyone who would like to read it and i hope you will find something useful.    en
