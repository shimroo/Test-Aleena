on december 17th, we were proud to support justice & mercy, inc.’s 17th annual whoopie pie day luncheon with a $2,500.00 sponsorship.
justice and mercy are foundational concepts of correctional health care, as they ensure that incarcerated individuals receive fair and compassionate medical services, regardless of their offenses. justice demands that care meets professional standards and is equally accessible, while mercy emphasizes the dignity and rehabilitation of each person. together, these principles promote healing, reduce recidivism, and support a more just society by affirming that all people, even those who have committed crimes, deserve humane treatment and the opportunity for positive change.
our desire is patients receive the same high-quality health care as we would wish for our families, loved-ones, and ourselves, and through our provision of that, our patients will return to their communities as healthier citizens.

hcv testing initiative launched new york state



primecare medical of new york, inc., in a collaborative effort with new york state dept. of health, is currently involved in a groundbreaking initiative for hepatitis c virus (hcv) testing throughout the state of new york.
the initiative aims to streamline the process of hcv detection and treatment by implementing testing protocols during the incarceration intake process. individuals identified as reactive during initial testing will undergo further assessment and testing.
the program’s innovative approach includes a seamless linkage of care, wherein individuals testing positive for hcv will be promptly referred to community partners for comprehensive treatment and support services. this strategic partnership between health providers and community organizations ensures that every case of hcv is identified and managed effectively.
while initially being piloted in monroe and livingston counties, the success of this initiative will see it expand to orleans and allegheny counties, then throughout all pcm facilities in new york. by integrating rapid testing into intake procedures and facilitating immediate referrals to community partners, we are taking proactive steps to combat hcv and improve health outcomes across new york state.
the implementation of hcv testing and efficient linkage to care underscores a concerted effort to address public health challenges and enhance the well-being of incarcerated populations and communities throughout the region. through collaboration and innovation, this initiative sets a precedent for comprehensive health care delivery and disease management strategies.
