8.      
your rights
8.1   
in this section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under data 
protection law. some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have 
been included in our summaries. accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and 
guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
8.2   
your principal rights under data protection law are:
(a)   
the right to access;
(b)   
the right to rectification;
(c)   
the right to erasure;
(d)   
the right to restrict processing;
(e)   
the right to object to processing;
(f)   
the right to data portability;
(g)   
the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
(h)   
the right to withdraw consent.
8.3   
you have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal 
data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional 
information. that additional information includes details of the purposes of the 
processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the 
personal data. providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we 
will supply to you a copy of your personal data. the first copy will be provided 
free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.[ you can 
access [your personal data] by visiting [url] when logged into our website.]
8.4   
you have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified

in some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your 
personal data. those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal 
data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal 
data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, 
exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending 
the verification of that objection. where processing has been restricted on this 
basis, we may continue to store your personal data. however, we will only otherwise

claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or 
for reasons of important public interest.
8.7   
you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds 
relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis 
for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a 
task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority 
vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a 
third party. if you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal 
information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing 
which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the 
establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
8.8   
you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for 
direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). if 
you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this 
purpose.
8.9   
you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for 
scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating 
to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance 
of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
8.10 
to the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data 
is:
(a)
