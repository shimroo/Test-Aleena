we are where good guns go to become great

















our legacy




founded in 1972 by garth choate as a one-man tool and die shop, we did gunsmithing and machine repair in central arkansas. our first products were magazine extensions for remington and browning shotguns. in fact, we were the first to offer magazine extensions to the public.  we were also first to offer after-market folding stocks and flash suppressors for the ruger mini-14. in 1981 we began making oem parts for major manufacturers. we have since made parts for smith & wesson, remington, mossberg, savage, h&k, winchester, anschutz, marlin, h&r, nighthawk,  ruger, beretta, springfield and kahr. choate machine & tool remains a top producers of oem parts for the firearms industry. from a modest 1,200 sf building to three separate factories for injection molding, investment casting and final assembly, we now have over 95,000 sf under roof.
