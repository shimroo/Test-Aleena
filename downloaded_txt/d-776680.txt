the board of directors of the rwuea welcomes

we produce a quarterly newsletter that reports 
		on monthly, quarterly and other gatherings around the country at various 
		local wu retirees groups. the newsletter also provides up-to-date 
		information on events occurring throughout the country. other sections 
		of the newsletter include reporting current information on the "new" wu, 
		nostalgic stories and photos from the "old- days", recent deaths and 
		obituaries. information about current members of our association can be 
		provided by emailing a request to　rwuea_news@hotmail.com. 
		some members have advised us that they do not wish any information given 
		out and, in such cases, the requestor will be advised that no 
		information is available.
we invite you to click on our site categories 
		below for more information. an application form is included on the 
		"contact us" page.
