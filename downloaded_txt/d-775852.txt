the speaker: doug dyment
“the go-light guru”—time magazine
doug dyment is recognized internationally as the leading authority on “the art and science of travelling light”. his popular onebag.com web site offers a compendium of practical information for those wondering if the joy of the journey can be freed from the labour of the luggage. and it resonates with business and leisure travellers alike, currently welcoming some four thousand daily visitors. consequently, doug is in frequent demand as a travel speaker, regularly interviewed — and lauded — by media worldwide.
the subject’s broad — indeed, almost universal — appeal has led to an ongoing demand for opportunities to experience the material live and locally. his “trove of packing-light wisdom” (says the san francisco chronicle) is “advocated with zest and humor” (says u.s.news), and filled with enough memorable moments and eye-opening examples to keep your group talking for a long time afterward. small wonder that neal conan (on npr’s talk of the nation) quipped, “doug dyment, we worship at your shrine!”

the topic: tackling today’s travel
doug offers meeting planners that true rarity in speaking programs: one that is simultaneously topical, entertaining, and truly useful to its audiences (many of whose stressful travels to the event will be all too fresh in their memories), delivering takeaway skills that attendees can put into immediate practice.
for over two thousand years, travel experts have extolled the wisdom that “he who would travel happily must travel light”, but a quick look around at any modern airport reveals just how few manage to make their travels truly efficient, effective, and effortless. after a brief overview of the five main benefits of travelling lightly (security, economy, mobility, serenity, ecology), doug reveals the three primary “secrets” of the successful traveller, and explores such issues as minimizing the amount of stuff one needs to haul around; understanding how to choose functional & reliable luggage; and making a little clothing work like a lot, without it getting wrinkled in the process.
those imagining that a program on travel skills might prove less than engaging will discover otherwise as they meet the concert solo violinist who travels the world with a single tiny suitcase; learn the secret that travel stores hide from their customers; see popular travel products debunked; discover the hidden delights of braided latex, plastic door locks, & dental floss; and find out how to dissuade a confrontational waiter who thinks he hasn’t been left a sufficiently large tip!

although last-minute openings do occur, it’s always wise to contact doug well in advance to hold your preferred dates. and be sure to read the reviews and testimonials!
