i have been working with svend and his company since 1993, and his dedication to helping me grow my various businesses has been invaluable over the years! svend is always on the cutting edge of design, marketing, seo, branding, technology, trends and so much more. svend is more than a designer… he is a complete business consultant for most any task! i highly recommend!!
