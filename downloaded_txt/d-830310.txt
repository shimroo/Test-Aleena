what is shelter?



cornerstone community outreach (cco) is an illinois-based nonprofit 501(c)(3) that provides care and shelter. “shelter” is a term that needs updating. two core principles of cco’s mission statement are “providing shelter” and “accepting people.” a shelter accepts people experiencing homelessness off the streets or out of other dangerous situations into safe refuge, but it doesn’t end there.
cco has over 35 years of experience providing shelter 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. our welcome extends to families, and adult individuals. it’s helpful to think of “shelter” as a temporary home with professional, compassionate support, called “wrap-around services.” the support from cco case managers will look different for everyone because each guest comes from a unique situation requiring a tailored, comprehensive plan to “help them find a home.” guests stay at cco for the time needed to get support and move into a home of their own.
