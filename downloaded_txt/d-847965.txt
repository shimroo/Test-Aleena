welcome to teamscr.com! what started in 1997 as the home of the biggest saturn road racing team in north america has spiraled completely out of control into your comprehensive resource for improved vehicle dynamics, high-performance brake system engineering, and bmw m4 gt4 road racing competition. whether you’re here to browse our saturn technical articles, register for one of our award-winning sae professional development seminars, peruse the ferrari challenge video gallery, scroll through 28 years of our nearly-famous tongue-in-cheek newsletters, or stay updated on our pursuit of the 2024 sro gt4 america pro-am championship, there is something here for you.
