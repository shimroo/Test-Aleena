prince albert, sk show dec. 2022



pino finishes off the year with a bang! he had not shown since june. he was changing coat and needed to mature a bit so we took the last 6 months off to do that. 6 shows right before new years and he did very well. 6 best of breed, grp 1, 2 grp 2 and 1 grp 4. a big thank you to the judges that awarded him this. he is about half way to his grand ch now. woo hoo!
