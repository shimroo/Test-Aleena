mission statement
food for thought is an authoritative collection of quotations 
that capture truth or epitomize lies, and provoke productive thought.

description
food for thought is a collection of quotations on myriad topics.  
this quotation site is different from others on the internet: most quotations 
include source information. i work hard to ensure that quotations are accurate 
and are attributed to the true author. read the caveat 
for more information.

how to find quotations
topics are sorted alphabetically.  browse quotations by topic by following 
any of the links named a-z, then follow a topic link, or browse the 
topics page.  find quotations by a 
particular person in the author 
index. longer excerpts and essays are in long.

use the food for thought search tool to find specific text.  
search capability is limited (exact matches only, boolean logic not 
supported), and can be slow (searching all the records may take a minute 
or two). up to fifty quotations are displayed per page; if more than fifty 
quotations match, follow the "more" link to display the next fifty matches.

how are quotations organized?
within topics, quotations are ordered by the author's birth year, then 
alphabetically by last name.

old- and new-testament passages are placed as if dated 0 bc/ad 0. other texts 
are placed by date of creation. undated texts are placed at the end of a topic 
section, as are quotations with 'anonymous' and 'unknown' sources, and those 
by authors with unknown birth year.

when quotations are added (or old ones corrected), pages in the main 
collection are updated. the latest site changes are described on the 
updates page. the most recently added and corrected 
quotations also can be found in new.  

biographical information
the biography pages list name, nationality, 
profession, and birth/death year for most people quoted in fft, 
and many more people not in fft.
