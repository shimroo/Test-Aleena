haydn quartet in e-flat major, op. 33, no.2
mozart string quintet in g minor, k. 516
dvorak quartet in a-flat major, op. 105











the ulysses quartet has been praised for their “textural versatility,” “grave beauty” and “the kind of chemistry many quartets long for, but rarely achieve” (the strad), as well as their “avid enthusiasm … [with] chops to back up their passion” (san diego story), “delivered with a blend of exuberance and polished artistry” (the buffalo news). the quartet “promise to bring as much sophistication, imagination and vitality to beethoven’s other quartets as they will to music by a panoply of composers from long ago and today” (gramophone).
founded in the summer of 2015, the group won the grand prize and gold medal in the senior string division of the 2016 fischoff national chamber music competition and first prize in the 2018 schoenfeld international string competition. in 2017, the quartet finished first in the american prize and won second prize at the osaka international chamber music competition. they were winners of the vietnam international music competition in 2019. ulysses garnered a career development grant in the 2016 banff international string quartet competition.
the quartet’s members hail from canada, the united states and taiwan. they have performed in such prestigious halls as carnegie hall, the harbin grand theatre, jordan hall, and the taiwan national recital hall. performance highlights have included their debut at alice tully hall along with appearances at the chautauqua institution (ny), sociedad filarmónica de bilbao (spain), ciclo de cámara y solistas in salamanca, the picasso museum in málaga, teatro mayor julio mario santo domingo in bogotá, highlands cashiers festival (nc), music mountain (ct) with pianist tanya bannister, chelsea music festival and ps21 (ny), national gallery of art (dc), jasper arts center (in), and san juan chamber music festival (co). their past season featured their mexico city debut at unam, along with performances for sociedad filarmónica de lima, gretna music, yale school of music with guitarist ben verdery, kansas city friends of chamber music, fundación juan march (madrid), sociedad filarmonica de vigo, basel kammermusik, and chamber music society of utica (ny). other notable engagements have included the buffalo chamber music society, chamber music society of lincoln center, premiere performances hong kong, national arts centre (ottawa), and cemal reşit rey concert hall (istanbul).
in the fall of 2023, the ulysses quartet became gbh music’s first-ever quartet in residence, a season-long partnership made possible by a generous contribution from the mattina r. proctor foundation. visiting residencies in recent seasons have included louisiana state university, ithaca college, syracuse university, and bucknell university. at juilliard from 2019 to 2022, they were the lisa arnhold fellows, serving as the school’s graduate resident string quartet for 3 years. from 2016 to 2019, ulysses was in residence at the louis moreau institute in new orleans, working with composer morris rosenzweig.
ulysses recently released their debut album, “shades of romani folklore,” on the navona label. the quartet also has two new collaborative albums out: “sea change quartets” by grammy-nominated composer joseph summer, and “a giant beside you” with guitarist benjamin verdery. they also appear on clovis nicolas’s album “the contrapuntist.”
the ulysses quartet believes intensely in the power of music to inspire, enlighten and bring people together. this is the guiding principle of the ulysses quartet foundation, dedicated to the performance and promotion of classical music of the past and present day to benefit the broadest possible audience of music lovers and potential music lovers by expanding their understanding and appreciation of the musical arts. ulysses aims to use this platform to raise the voices of underrepresented bipoc and female composers. the quartet also offers interactive programs and workshops for all ages that serve to demystify the traditional repertoire while introducing audiences to diverse programming. their programs enable participants to learn about the inner workings of a string quartet and to explore the connections between classical music and our world today. the group’s name pays homage to homer’s hero odysseus and his arduous homeward voyage, signifying the constant pursuit of artistic and personal ideals.
the members of ulysses hold degrees from the manhattan school of music, new england conservatory, boston conservatory, the juilliard school, and university of north texas. the musicians perform on instruments and bows graciously on loan from the maestro foundation and private donors. ulysses is grateful for the support of shar music and connolly music as ysoa ambassadors.

leonkoro string quartet (sf debut)

haydn quartet in f major, op. 50 no 5 “the dream”
berg lyric suite
mendelssohn quartet in e minor, op. 44 no 2










“the leonkoro quartet possesses an extraordinary stage presence, embracing both full artistic risk and profound sensitivity”
– frankfurter allgemeine zeitung


the leonkoro quartet, founded in berlin in 2019, is framed by brothers jonathan and lukas schwarz on first violin and cello, while the middle voices are formed by amelie wallner on second violin and mayu konoe on viola. in esperanto, leonkoro means lionheart, alluding to a children’s book about two brothers, a book that juxtaposes the grave reality of death with a large and heartfelt yearning for comfort and solace – a sentiment that string quartet repertoire addresses in several instances.
the quartet’s international recognition began in 2021 when, as the youngest ensemble, they claimed the top prize and the coveted audience prize at the renowned borciani string quartet competition. then, in the annus mirabilis of 2022, the leonkoro quartet garnered an astounding series of prestigious accolades: first, the highly prestigious jürgen ponto foundation music prize, followed by a triumph at the wigmore hall string quartet competition where they earned both first prize and nine special awards. then the quartet seized not only first  prize at the concours international de quatuor à bordeaux but also the audience prize. shortly thereafter, they were invited to join the bbc radio 3 new generation artists program.  2022 was capped by one final honor: the merito string quartet award.
the leonkoro has deepened their interpretations by study with members of the artemis and alban berg quartets, as well as pianist alfred brendel.
in autumn 2023, the quartet will release its highly anticipated debut album, featuring ravel’s string quartet and schumann’s 3rd quartet, on the mirare label.
in the 2023/2024 season, the leonkoro quartet is making debuts at the berlin philharmonie, the kölner philharmonie, the flagey brussels, the concertgebouw amsterdam and the konzerthaus wien, to name a few, and will perform at such renowned festivals as the rheingau music festival, the string quartet biennale paris, and the heidelberg fruehling. furthermore, the quartet continues its residency in leeds.

the quartet’s international recognition began in 2021 when, as the youngest ensemble, they claimed the top prize and the coveted audience prize at the renowned borciani string quartet competition. then, in the annus mirabilis of 2022, the leonkoro quartet garnered an astounding series of prestigious accolades: first, the highly prestigious jürgen ponto foundation music prize, followed by a triumph at the wigmore hall string quartet competition where they earned both first prize and nine special awards. then the quartet seized not only first  prize at the concours international de quatuor à bordeaux but also the audience prize. shortly thereafter, they were invited to join the bbc radio 3 new generation artists program.  2022 was capped by one final honor: the merito string quartet award.
the leonkoro has deepened their interpretations by study with members of the artemis and alban berg quartets, as well as pianist alfred brendel.
in autumn 2023, the quartet will release its highly anticipated debut album, featuring ravel’s string quartet and schumann’s 3rd quartet, on the mirare label.

“the beijing duo’s performance was a model of elegant clarity, sumptuously beautiful tone production, and emotional contrast.​”
– san francisco classical voice


praised by classical guitar magazine as “having the potential to serve as inspiration for new generations of guitarists to come,” the beijing guitar duo launched their international concert career with a new york debut in carnegie hall in 2010.  beyond their virtuosic techniques, both artists’ approach is one that embodies pure chamber music at its finest: collaboration, organic in-the-moment response, and relinquishing the soloist’s spotlight in service to the ensemble.
the duo has performed around the world in halls such as the concertgebouw, palau de musica, tchaikovsky  hall and the national theatre in beijing. they regularly tour the united states — washington d.c., cincinnati, cleveland, chicago, detroit, milwaukee, knoxville, etc. – as well as europe and china. they collaborate with orchestras, in ensemble with flutist marina piccinini, guitarists grigoryan brothers and with their mentor manuel barrueco.
their debut cd maracaípe received a latin-grammy nomination for the titled piece, which was dedicated to them by renowned guitarist sergio assad. their second cd, bach to tan dun, has been widely noted for the world-premiere recording of tan dun’s eight memories in watercolor, specially arranged for the duo by manuel barrueco. a trio recording in trio with barrueco, china west, was released in 2014.
meng su and yameng wang were born in the coastal city of qingdao, china. they came to the partnership with exceptional credentials, including a string of competition awards. ms. su’s honors include victories at the vienna youth guitar competition and the christopher parkening guitarist competition, while ms. wang was the youngest guitarist to win the tokyo international guitar competition at the age of 12, and was invited by radio france to perform at the prestigious paris international guitar art week at age 14. both young artists had given solo recitals in china and abroad, and had made recordings before they formed the duo.
in addition to concertizing, the artists share a love for teaching which brings them to the world’s major conservatories for master classes and to judge competitions.
