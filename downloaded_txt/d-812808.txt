what our past clients are saying…

“anello fencing is great! service is good. the owner, steve, is great! a man of his word. with contractors, there will always be a problem… what separates a good contractor from a bad one is there service… steve will always come back to repair or service his work. he’s a man of his word!”
jake w.manhattan, ny
“after checking different contractors to do a pool fence… we hired anello fence. they actually did the current fence 15 years ago and it looks like new, but 15 years is a long time and people change, and after reading the reviews we were anxious.i have to say that steve anello is polite and a good businessman. he gave us an excellent price. they had to cut some bushes on the way: they asked us first and they cleaned up everything after. they really did an excellent job. we will definitely highly recommend anello fence.”
