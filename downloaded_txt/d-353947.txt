   parish cookout - the parish cookout took place on sunday. august 18 at the parish center, where parishioners enjoyed hamburgers and hot dogs prepared by the canton council 2095 of the knights of columbus. the event was organized by members of the parish council, and the canton catholic women's club generously contributed to the food for the event. it was a wonderful occasion that allowed us to enjoy some time with our fellow parishioners in a casual and friendly environment as the summer comes to a close.
