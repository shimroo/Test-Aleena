what they’re saying


 “we came from nashville, tn, to do a wedding in the napa valley. never have we had a more pleasant experience with floral wholesalers! sequoia knocked it out of the park with service, product, and facilities. we rented workspace and cooler space from them, and they even helped us deliver to napa! thanks to the entire staff at sequoia--our new west coast friends! as we say in the south, "y'all are awesome!"”  john congerflorist “i worked with marina from sequoia floral international for my wedding bouquets and boutonnieres. she was personable, thorough and made sure to get pictures of what i wanted. it was easy to pay and pick up. their prices were so reasonable that i was unsure of how the flowers were going to turn out. let me tell you, the flowers were amazing. they not only met my expectations, but exceeded every pinterest photo i had sent over. my friends could not stop talking about the floral at the wedding. if you need wedding floral, or any other type of floral done, i would highly recommend sequoia floral!!”  kristin b.bride “we traveled from indiana to design for a clients wedding in sonoma. sequoia made us right at home. the product was beyond amazing!! i can’t thank everyone enough for the hospitality. the designers at sequoia are also top notch. the garland the girls made—-lush, beautiful and lasted all week!!! thank you, thank you thank you!”  jim simsfloral designer “i used sequoia floral international for my recent wedding and they were spectacular. they made my wedding bouquet, centerpieces, corsages, boutonnieres, chair decor, a garland for a wedding sign i had, as well as providing rose petals for my wedding aisle. they also were able to attach two photos to my wedding bouquet of my grandparents who are no longer with us. i even picked up extra bunches of florals from them and created some of my own small vases for around the venue. everything they did looked absolutely beautiful, and the quality of the flowers was exceptional. i think the value for money was great as well.
everything was done through danette for the most part and she was wonderful to work with and answered any questions i had.
i would recommend sequoia floral to anyone!”  danielle k.bride
