mood:   bored
music: when you had left our pirate fold - pirates of penzance

i am bored though i really shouldn't be i have work to do d8anonymous commenting is on. what i want you to do is a post a confession in a comment. it can be about anything, even me, but you must make it anonymously. hell, it can be the most retarded, pointless confession ever, for all i care. i'll probably reply, too.idea taken from halfthewords. don't forget to post anonymously!click on "more options" when you post to comment anonymously, or select the "anonymous" option before you comment.i feel like tacos rereading eragon. d:

mood:   exhausted
music: how i know you - aida

...yeah, alright. so i privated my last entry, because i was very angry when i made it, and yeah. no one needs to read that if they haven't already. but i'm not as angry anymore, so i think i'm just going to drop it until i have a chance to talk to him. because quite frankly, it's very retarded to have these kind of fights on aim.anyway.i finished my speech, w00t~! but, i seemed to have lost my usb :| so, i'm posting a back up here.( blah blah prison bitch blah.collapse )why does aida have to not be on broadway anymore just when i discover the amazing-ness of that musical? 8| adam pascal and ancient egypt love. ♥ no matter how you suck at looking like an egyptian prince, adam....sleep.
