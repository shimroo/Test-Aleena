specialists in proficiency testing for terrestrial animals and plant health laboratories.

the australian national quality assurance program (anqap) is an international proficiency testing program for veterinary and plant health laboratories.  the major focus of the program is to provide proficiency testing for veterinary tests associated with disease control programs, quarantine and export health certification. the history section of this website contains more details. we are hosted by the department of energy, environment and climate action (deeca) – agriculture victoria research division, located at agribio centre in victoria, australia.
the program currently offers 37 different tests used for the diagnosis of diseases in the areas of veterinary serology, virology and bacteriology. the program has more than 30 veterinary laboratories participating from australia, new zealand, asia, africa, europe and north america.
anqap also run the national plant health proficiency testing program (nphptp) on behalf of the subcommittee on plant health diagnostics (sphd). the nphptp includes six annual plant health tests for identification of invertebrates, nematodes, virus, bacteria, fungi and phytoplasma.
