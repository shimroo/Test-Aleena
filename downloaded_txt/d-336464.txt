welcome to inspiring senior minds

my name is chris wells, a professional speaker, photographer, entrepreneur and proud to be a senior citizen. as a former school teacher i enjoy educating, entertaining inspiring people with my presentations. i find i easily connect with my audiences with the stories, photos and videos that help me tell about my love of nature, visits to many of our national parks and travels to countries around the world. if you are looking for an enthusiastic, engaging and motivational speaker to inspire your audience, i would love to talk with you. and i totally love what i am doing!



coronavirus note:    as senior communities begin to return to some semblance of normalcy, i am still offering video presentations (single or 3-for-2 monthly specials), zoom presentations and “live in-person” presentations in colorado.  i continue creating “stories seniors tell”. these are 5 minute videos of the wide variety of stories & memories seniors have shared with me over the years. this is free. 🙂 thanks chris



 this site is also temporarily the landing page for my other websites – travels with chris wells and second chance photography. so if you got here by following links to those domains, you are in the right place! 🙂
 
now back to business. the photo at the top was taken on a spring drive coming back to denver from telluride where we had a huge snow storm in the mountains. i call this “the road home” and had to pull over to get the wonderful contrast in seasons. the image on the left is from one of my “florida ghost towns – memories on the back roads” presentations at a senior living facility in bradenton, fl. 
i absolutely love doing presentations at senior living communities. i am now over 900 presentations in colorado, arizona, florida, montana, wisconsin and california. my presentations are broken down into three categories: national parks presentations, countries around the world presentations and various other travel destinations presentations. 

if you would like know more about chris please visit the about page. if you would like to see a listing of all the places she has done presentations, go to the presentation locations page. some of my nature photography can be found on the second chance photography page.  i took up photography at the age of 60 after finding out i had a heart attack. that was quite the wake up call. life is good!
finally, if you would like to leave a comment, ask about a presentation or maybe book a presentation, please visit the contact page. i will get back with you as soon as i can.
here is a peak at my national parks presentations opening slides.
