     education by placing the   
     student 
                          at the  center of

 anova 
              science education corporation is  a science education professional development rip® service provider and publisher, under the name  anova science publishing, for  rip® (research investigation process) science education materials. 
the 
                corporate mission is to assist institutions with the 
                revamping ofâ grades k-12 education, with emphasis on critical thinking, scientific and engineering practices,
                and stem.â 
our main goal is to provide to schools rip® products and rip® services that help to 
                    produce students who meet or exceed state and national 
                    science (ngss and nses) education standards, who can function in society as 
                    scientifically-literate consumers of stem information, and 
          who pursue careers in science and other stem fields.


 


 our 
                  research-based approach to stem education through scientific 
                  inquiry emphasizes:
  •  teaching stem and non-stem  content areas 
       through scientific inquiry.
  
              •  increasing scientific literacy and critical
       thinking and decision-making abilities   in   
      all   k-12 students.            
  
              
 
                 •       
              promoting scientific reasoning as a tool for
       educated consumption of 
                 health and science
       information. 
  
              
 
                •  producing students who are motivated  
       to  
              pursue careers  in 
                science and/or the other
       stem fields. 
  
               •  producing citizens capable of contributing
        to economic leadership role in the world.
    


 


 anova 
              science education employs a critical thinking model 
              called the research 
              investigation process, or rip ®, 
              developed by neuroscientist and company president and founder dr. 
              robert landsman. the rip utilizes the same inquiry, thinking skills, and practices that scientists and engineers use to learn about and impact the world. research findings strongly support the rip as a rich instructional and learning model.the extremely powerful influence of the rip on instructional practices and student learning are strongly supported by student and teacher data, program evaluation findings, and current neuroscience research findings focusing on the brain and learning and memory.  the rip fosters students who become life-long learners and valuable 
              contributors to society while they are still in school and beyond.



 


  as 
                a critical thinking paradigm, the rip  is readily applicable to learning 
                in all content areas. because the rip model infuses the four stem content areas into the learning process, students in essence are able to learn any content area through stem using this approach.  rip-based learning places the student 
                in the role of instructional partner with the teacher.  students 
                learn through the context of answering their own questions that 
          are relevant to their own lives and interests.


 


 anova 
              science education corporation services public and private school districts through teacher and administrator 
              professional development seminars and workshops, teacher mentoring in inquiry-based instruction, and development of inquiry-based curriculum specifically tailored to meet the needs of the district, school, and/or classroom. our products and services are available 
              for worldwide distribution.
