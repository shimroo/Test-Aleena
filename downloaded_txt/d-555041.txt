we've saved for your future!

education, like the economy, is becoming ever more global, with students in the united states eager to enter international economic and political organizations, and international students struggling to achieve the pot of gold at the end of their rainbow: a diploma from a university in the united states.
 unfortunately, i won't be able to keep pace with the changes in college, law school and medical school admissions much longer. after 25 years of informing you of new and important changes, it's time to let the deloggio achievement program become an archive, rather than a growing knowledge base.      
 i'll spend my last year of business trying to organize hundreds of pages into a manageable form, so every page and section  will be linked to the latest information as of my retirement date: december 31, 2023. but the web page will remain here, to assist you in building your future, as we have since our internet debut on april 1, 1996.
