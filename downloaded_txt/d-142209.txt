latest industry news

meet some azfreight premium members













                  "az helped us get to the next level"              

we think azfreight does amazing things for the freight industry by connecting suppliers with buyers on a global scale. we are enjoying our premium listing because it raises our company profile in all the countries we want to reach.
all the recent innovations on azfreight have greatly helped brunswick, and we will be continuing as a premium listing.

                  "professional and reliable!"              

i have known azfreight for all 12 years existence of my company, cargofast. i’ll explain: when we started back in 2008 and we were very small and did not belong to any forwarders network, azfreight was of great help as azfreight listed forwarders, and were our only source of support on a worldwide basis for our initial shipments to/from brazil.
today we are member of 5 networks, and still we rely on azfreight, and pay a lot of respect to their listed forwarders!

director, intl operations and pricing
cargofast logística do brasil ltda


















                  "fantasic way to get business!"              

alongside az’s new ability to target the countries we need to reach, the publicity of a premium listing has given us valuable connections and partnerships worldwide.

                  "the best freight forwarding network"              

since we upgraded to premium on az freight, we’ve seen an increase of 300% new leads from overseas!
azfreight is doing a great job and has given a terrific boost to our marketing sector.
i highly recommend azfreight premium to all agents who want to drive their company to the next level.

                  "big step in international freight transportation"              

we started using premium listings on azfreight.com quite recently, but we have already seen a number of its advantages. premium listing has given us a large number of incoming requests that are relevant, promising and 100% correspond to our area of interest and specialization.
azfreight.com and its premium listing shows itself as a good tool for attracting new customers in international air freight transportation, as well as a good reference resource for finding a reliable logistics partner abroad.

operations supervisor

                  "easiest way of getting new leads!"              

the az team has really gone to the limit by reminding us whenever there are inquiries, and also if there are any other business opportunities. upgrading to premium on az is worth every penny as we get to work with many partners around the world, and serve many as well.
overall, az is a very good platform for getting in leads and customers!

                  "here's where you find great business partners!"              

i have known azfreight for many years and for me, it is a strategic ally in the international transportation business.
since we began crossing continents logistics, we have supported azfreight with premium membership. i personally think azfreight offers much more than most international cargo directories and networks. i strongly recommend azfreight!.
