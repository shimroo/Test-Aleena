about us
 
 

scat is a veteran human rights and social justice, philanthropy (re-granting) organisation which has been in existence for 40 years. it has pioneered and developed a model of development that has been acknowledged as empowering and sustainable with tangible impact at the local level. scat was founded during the early 1980’s by three trustees who believed there was a need to provide grants to organisations to promote community-based control which was seen as a critical component of transformative development and the creation of a strong civil society and good governance. this role is as relevant today as it was fourty years ago.
our mission is to empower communities, strengthen civil society, and promote social change in partnership with community based organisations who lead community responses to social justice.
