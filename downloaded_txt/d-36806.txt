jeremy parsons about "good ole days":

        you ever hear the one about the father and son that walked into the hardware store? thatâs exactly where the idea for âgood ole daysâ started. from the older gentleman behind the counter revisiting when he used to go out and pick cotton with his dad and brothers, to a blind man named âthe colonelââ¦i enjoyed writing this song because, as much as it was about looking back for the characters, itâs also about knowing that looking forward is just as important. i like the thought that our fondest memories are yet to be made.
