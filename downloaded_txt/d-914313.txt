what to expect.



                        located in eastern maine, just a three minute walk from downtown bar harbor, poor boy's gourmet restaurant has been a local favorite of diners seeking delicious food at reasonable prices for over
                        30 years. featuring lobster, seafood, steak, chicken, vegetarian dishes and poor boy's special "seconds on us" pasta bowl, it will take you several minutes just to look over our menus. take your
                        time, the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. it is so relaxing that you won't be thinking about your forex during this visit.
                    

                        if you'd care to begin with a cocktail, poor boy's has a full bar and we make the best frozen  blueberry daiquiris in new england. we have several locally brewed beers on tap, an excellent wine list
                        and a complete selection of non-alcoholic beverages.
                    
don't forget to save room for dessert. our cheesecake and berry pies keep our customers coming back year after year! all in all, we're "simple done well"

some of our happy customers








                                        well, i'm from philly, and my husband is from ny originally but now we live in far northern maine. we love poor boy's, and it is our prime travel destination in bar harbor where we travel to almost
                                        every autumn. service is always excellent. when we make reservations, we never have to wait. the food has always been excellent, especially their lazy lobster. specialty drinks and desserts are
                                        hedonistic! and service is always top-notch, since the owners are family and really care. can't wait to go back year after year.

                                        while visiting bar harbor, we inquired with a local merchant who had the best local food and were directed toward this restaurant. at the end of the retail mania, a quaint looking house now restaurant
                                        was drawing a crowd around 4 pm. the restaurant opened at 430 pm with many of them discussing their dining experience from the night before. as we waited, we glanced at the paper menu and enormous
                                        homemade dessert section. our dinner was awesome and well worth the wait and walk to this establishment. the crab cakes were " melt in your mouth" delicious while the pasta entrees were equally
                                        delicious. our take along blueberry white chocolate cheesecake was a baker's dream.

                                        last night was yet again a fantastic dining experience at the poor boy's gourmet. took my high school best friend, and he was amazed. baked stuffed haddock is fantastic as usual. the couple next to us
                                        ordered the giant cream puff and blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream.... she finished off both deserts..... i was so impressed we did the same thing, except michael ate half of everything so we just
                                        shared.... make reservations to make sure you get a table....

                                        we ate here on a warm evening (upstairs next to the window)! the boiled lobster meal comes with a lobster bisque to start, a whole lobster to follow with vegetable sides and then a brownie an
                                        ice-cream for dessert! unbeatable value! my husband had the baked haddock with shrimp and said it was great too! nice service and good wines.
