a brilliant day out, used to take my daughter when she was little. this time (25 years later) she had her own little girls with her.











it was an amazing and magical experience. i can say that i enjoyed it as much as my daughters. definitely a must visit place. the staff were incredibly nice, the whole place was magical, the train ride was amazing.
