kids age 3 to grade 5 at calvary

calvary kids is where it’s at on sundays! calvary kids is where kids will be introduced to the incredible and exciting story of jesus. we do this through kid-led worship, large-group conversations about the bible and faith, and small groups where caring leaders help kids know they are known and have a place to belong.

yth at calvary challenges students to own their faith by encouraging honest conversations, providing space for asking questions and exploring their doubts. through this, they discover that jesus can be trusted no matter what. adults and peers walk together as they contemplate the mystery of god.
