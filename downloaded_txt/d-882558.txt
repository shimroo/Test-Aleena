reviews


                                    being an a long term avid car enthusiast, i interact with a significant number of car people and firms across the planet.  motor classic and competition is a true gem in the industry.  the knowledge and skill is flat out world classic.  every time it’s always fact based and accurate. nick is a car guru or maybe even an exotic car whisperer : )  i value every interaction with nick, tiziana and team - thank you for many deals and solutions : )
