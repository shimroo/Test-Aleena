recent reviews
the taill of rauf coilȝear, ed. ralph hanna, isbn 9781897976371, 2019
'[i]nterpretation of the complexity of the style and function of the poem is made convincing by hanna’s insightful explanation and understanding of the central moral of the text'
'overall, the buke of the howlat is an enjoyable scots poem with a compelling introduction by ralph hanna.'
helen smith, journal of the northern renaissance
'the strength of the new edition lies in hanna’s commentary, with wide-ranging cross-reference, not only on language and metrical issues, but also on parallel textual problems observed in the manuscript transmission of other works.'
patrick scott, studies in scottish literature, 46.1 (2020), 181-83
duncane laideus testament and other comic poems in older scots, ed. janet hadley williams, isbn 9781897976388, 2016
'this splendid edition of eleven short comic poems in older scots, none previously appearing in a modern critical edition, helps broaden our sense of the rich literary culture of later medieval and early modern scotland'.
'the edition is carefully produced, as is only to be expected by the high editorial standards of the scottish text society'.
'students of older scots literature owe hadley williams a debt of gratitude for giving these delightful comic poems the editorial care they deserve'.
r. james goldstein, journal of english and germanic philology, 118.2 (2019)
the maitland quarto: a new edition of cambridge, magdalene college, pepys library ms 1408, ed. joanna m. martin, isbn 9781897976401, 2015
'the edition provides a comprehensive look at the culture, textual history, and contents of the mq and makes the details of the manuscript accessible to scholars of both older scots literature and medieval literature in general'.
'the up-to-date, comprehensive information included is a pivotal starting point for anyone studying maitland’s poetry or the literary cultures of the mq. scholars and enthusiasts of older scots literature and literary cultures would be remiss if they fail to add this text to their library'.
ruth m.e. oldman, journal of the northern renaissance.

the buke of the howlat. by james robertson and kate leiper. birlinn, 2016.[more info]related sts volume: 5th series, 12: richard holland, the buke of the howlat, ed. ralph hanna isbn 9781897976395 [more info] [buy members] [buy non-members]



transforming early english by jeremy j, smith shows how historical pragmatics can offer a powerful explanatory framework for the changes medieval english and older scots texts undergo, as they are transmitted over time and space. the book argues that formal features such as spelling, script and font, and punctuation - often neglected in critical engagement with past texts - relate closely to dynamic, shifting socio-cultural processes, imperatives and functions. this theme is illustrated through numerous case-studies in textual recuperation, ranging from the reinvention of old english poetry and prose in the later medieval and early modern periods, to the eighteenth-century 'vernacular revival' of literature in older scots. forthcoming from cambridge university press in april 2020.
