welcome to quechua! 
the language of the people who built this...
 

 
... and of
  millions of their descendants in the andes today.




 




this web address is home to three
  websites on quechua and aymara.  
  we are preparing a new portal to bring them together, but for now please
  choose here:  
 
1.  our
  main quechua website moved here from its old home at
  www.shef.ac.uk/q/quechua
2.  the
 sounds of
  the andean languages website and
  accompanying cd‑rom.  listen online to recordings of languages of the quechua and
  aymara families, as spoken throughout peru, bolivia and ecuador.  see over 400 photos of all these quechua- and
  aymara-speaking regions.  find out about
  the origins, history and regional diversity of both language families, and about
  official quechua spelling.
3.  a more technical website, intended
  particularly for linguists, on a comparative study
  of the andean languages.
