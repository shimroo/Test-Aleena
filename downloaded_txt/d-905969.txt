we are testing the video function on our camera for try change.  zoe is our cat in this video.  she found us almost 6 years ago at a local car wash.  no mama to be found so she's still here with us.  i don't think she knows she's a cat :-) as for the bees, they don't have names and they aren't pets but they do drive us crazy.  these look like bubble bees and i don't really want to kill them but if anyone knows how to keep them out of our yard i would greatly appreciate any tips.

my first show!





so today was my very first craft show :-) cindy and i did the thomas jefferson holiday craft show today...it was really a lot of fun! we met a lot of very interesting people and many different jewelry vendors. plus we got to just chat and catch up a little. and i actually sold a couple of pieces! it was really funny because i almost didn't put on a couple of the bracelets that sold because i didn't think that the wire work was good enough :-) speaking of wire work, cindy had some truely beautiful pieces! her wire work was just amazing! take a second and surf on over to her site at: sweet bead studioyou won't be disappointed! thanks for stopping by!
