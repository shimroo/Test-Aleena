making my big move

 

 
i have made many references in my book a terrible beauty
to the emotional trauma that i experienced in 1968 when i watched 800 young american 
soldiers die in vietnam. i have ever since been haunted by the magnificence with 
which they did their duty. also haunting me was the suspicion that they had 
perhaps died needlessly, that there was no genuine need for this war, other than 
to enrich the dogs of war (the american arms manufacturers and banking interests 
that financed the war). so i spent many years reading and studying to figure out 
the truth.
 
what i found was that there is an ongoing exploitation of 
the american people by a group of international bankers. they have, for their 
own enrichment, maneuvered us into most of our wars. they have also plundered 
much of the wealth of our country. this group consists of the ten largest 
banking families. the major player is the rothschild family in europe.
 
the rothschilds rose to prominence during the time of 
napoleon. prior to napoleon, wars had always been paid for by the spoils of war. 
the winner took home the riches of the loser. but napoleon was the first to turn 
to bankers to finance some of his wars. a banker in paris named rothschild was 
deeply involved in this. as a result, the rothschild family eventually emerged 
as the richest family in europe. over the following generations the many sons of 
this family expanded their influence into all areas, political, business and 
military. they now have one half of the worldã¢â¬â¢s wealth at their disposal. but 
they choose to operate with great secrecy so that few people are even aware of 
their existence.
 
one indicator of their power is that they secretly have 
their own country. there is a section of downtown london that they own. it has 
been declared a separate country, so that english laws do not apply there. you 
can imagine the advantages to them of this arrangement. because they control 
almost all of the media, you will never hear about this through regular channels 
of communication. as a matter of fact, you will never hear any criticism of the 
rothschild empire for this same reason.
 
one of the major ways that they have made their money is by 
controlling the banking systems of many european countries, including england 
and france. so, when the usa began, they attempted to also wrest control of our 
banking system. alexander hamilton pushed their interests here. knowing this 
makes more sense of the struggles of hamilton against other patriot interests, 
such as thomas jefferson. fortunately jefferson prevailed.
 
i shall from now on refer to the rothschild empire as the 
ã¢â¬åbanking cabalã¢â¬â. by the way, the rockefeller family is the most powerful usa 
banking family in this cabal. over the years, american patriots made great strides in resisting 
the entreaties of the cabal, as the cabal kept trying to take over our banking 
system. 
 
at this point i should point out how they have interfered 
in the welfare of other nations. one example: the tsar of russia also resisted their 
overtures. the tsar was a very good man and was well liked by the people. when 
the cabal sensed the weakness in russia that was being caused by wwi, they sent 
a political radical named lenin, along with $15 million, in a special sealed 
train from paris to moscow. using these funds, lenin successfully engineered the 
communist revolution in russia. the tsar was killed. the rothschilds prevailed.
 
another story worth knowing is the truth about hitler, and 
his rise and fall. when hitler became the chancellor of germany, the country was 
in economic shambles. inflation was out of control, unemployment was 50%, 
rioting and demonstrations were widespread. hitler immediately ordered banking 
reforms, and issued a new currency that was owned by the government. he set up 
major public works projects. one was to build the autobahn system, which still 
operates today. [eisenhower was so impressed with the scope and effect of this 
highway system that later, as us president, he launched the construction of the 
us interstate highway system in the 1950s, which is basically a copy of the 
german autobahn system].
 
with a stable currency, and newly generated prosperity, 
within a decade germany rose from shambles to be the strongest country in 
europe. this is why the german people worshipped hitler so. the darker side of 
hitlerã¢â¬â¢s personality and his nazi regimeã¢â¬â¢s horrific and dishonorable methods were overlooked by 
the people. hitler had rescued them once, and their trust in him was deep, if 
tragically mistaken.
 
some historians now recognize that the cabal had a heavy 
hand in maneuvering us into wwii. for instance, one story that has never made 
sense is rudolph hessã¢â¬â¢s suicidal flight by single engine plane to ireland in the 
early days of the war. he was soon captured. then he was tortured, his legs were 
broken, and he spent the rest of his life imprisoned by the british. what did he 
do to deserve such treatment? he didnã¢â¬â¢t murder anyone, he was only hitlerã¢â¬â¢s 
 personal aide during the first part of hitlerã¢â¬â¢s reign, well before the nazi 
atrocities began.  also, later many nuremburg war criminals who had done 
horrific things, received lesser sentences than did hess. it didnã¢â¬â¢t make sense. 
for the rest of his imprisoned life he was never permitted to be alone with any 
visitor. what were they afraid that he might say? it is widely suspected that 
when he was in his mid-sixties he was strangled in his cell by british agents to 
prevent his eventual release.
 
what is believed by many historians is that the actual 
purpose of hessã¢â¬â¢s secret flight to ireland was that he was sent by hitler as a 
secret emissary to negotiate peace with the british. the cabal did not want 
peace. they wanted the banking systems of russia and germany destroyed. peace 
was in conflict with the cabal agenda to destroy both the governments of russia 
and germany, the two countries that kept cabal banking out of their country. 
thus hess had to be stopped, and the true purpose of hessã¢â¬â¢s journey had to be 
kept secret.
 
could it be that the horrific destruction in europe, the 
death of millions, the devastation of so many countries, was all to further the 
agendas of the cabal? some think so.
 
the cabal had waited patiently for many years for the opportunity to get 
the cabal monetary system installed in the usa. finally an opportunity arose. 
they placed a political neophyte, woodrow wilson, as president. his personal 
advisor was the infamous and mysterious ã¢â¬åcolonel edward houseã¢â¬â. house was the 
rothschildã¢â¬â¢s personal flunkie, passing along rothschild orders to the 
inexperienced president. so they ran our country.
 
the rothschilds created a private american company, named 
the federal reserve bank. it was incorporated in delaware in 1913. at 10:00pm on 
christmas eve, 1913, a secret meeting of congress was called. with few members 
of congress present (all rothschild stooges) the federal reserve act was passed, 
establishing the federal reserve bank as the official bank of the usa. when the 
rest of congress returned after the holidays it was a done deal.
 
what this meant was that from then on, the federal reserve 
would issue all currency. what this meant is that the federal reserve could 
print a $100 bill (it cost them 2 cents to do this), and sell it to the american 
public for $100. in this manner they have earned approximately $200 billion 
dollars a year, all with no risk and no investment. using their massive 
influence with the us congress and the media, the cabal managed to convince the 
american public that the federal reserve bank is part of the us government. this 
charade carries on today. only a few realize the truth. as congressman ron paul 
often says, ã¢â¬åthe federal reserve is no more part of our government than is 
federal expressã¢â¬â.
 
[note; the book the creature from jekyll island by 
g. edward griffin is an excellent reference source for this information.]
 
the implications of this are immense. the much touted 
federal debt is not real. we do not owe the trillions of dollars to them that 
you are told that we do. why not? because it is a fraudulent debt. i will 
explain why below.
 
in 1914 a dollar was worth a dollar. today it is worth 7 
cents. how did this happen? because of the federal reserve. they can print our 
money as they see fit, and use it as they see fit. our congress will not allow 
them to be audited. with no oversight of any type, the cabal has run amok with 
our money. as they have issued our money for their own personal banking and 
investment uses, this oversupply of currency in the system has led to the 
inflation that has eventually crippled the value of our money.
 
why does the federal reserve bank push wars? because they 
are so profitable. we pay for our wars with money borrowed from the federal 
reserve. we pay interest on this money. since it costs the cabal nothing to 
issue this currency, it is immensely profitable for them (both the principal and 
the interest are all profit). with these ill-gotten gains, they have bought up 
control of our oil, automotive, pharmaceutical, media (newspapers, tv and movie 
entertainment). they make massive political donations to control our white house 
and congress. they seem unstoppable. with their massive power who can oppose 
them?
 
it was in 1995 that i eventually figured all this out. i 
was living in orlando, florida. i was single at the time. i still had a deep 
need to do something to validate the loss of all those soldiers who i saw die in 
vietnam in 1968.
 
a little empire fights back
 
in 1995 my life was not going well. i had financial and 
business problems galore, my personal life was a mess, and i was unhappy. so, 
after pondering on it for a while, i decided to do something against the federal 
reserve bank. granted, it would probably be futile. but at least i would be 
striking back on behalf of ã¢â¬åthe 800ã¢â¬â, the young americans from rach kein (our 
base camp) who died in vietnam. i decided to sue the federal reserve bank in 
federal court in tampa florida. i would use the provisions of title 42 of the us 
code. the basis of my lawsuit would be:

the federal reserve bank was private bank, 
	incorporated in delaware. i had a copy of their organization papers, sealed 
	with approval by the state of delaware.
all private business must register with the secretary 
	of state in which they operate. for example, if i go to nevada and conduct 
	business with my colorado corporation, i must register with the secretary of 
	state of nevada. this is so nevada can insure that i pay proper taxes for 
	the business that i conduct in their state. if i do not register, all the 
	business that i have conducted in nevada is null and void.
the federal reserve has never registered to do 
	business with the secretary of state of any of the 50 states in which it 
	does business.
why do they do this? i believe that one of the reasons 
	that the federal reserve pretends to be part of the government is so that 
	they do not pay taxes. taxes on their profits, which approach 100%, would be 
	immense. the federal reserve pays no taxes at all.
because the federal reserve is not registered to do 
	business in any of the 50 states, all business that it has conducted since 
	1914 is null and void. this means, for instance, all home mortgages would 
	become null and void. imagine if you will, the wild situation that would be 
	created if this were to happen.
the nature of my lawsuit would be that the federal 
	reserve bank is operating illegal in all 50 states, and should be disbanded.

 
 
when i approached orlando attorneys about representing me 
in the lawsuit, they got wide-eyed and said ã¢â¬åyou will just get both of us 
killed. do you realize who you are going up against?ã¢â¬â i understood their 
concerns, but these lawyers had not gone through plebe yearã¢â¬â¢s beast barracks at 
west point. hey, i already knew hopelessness. i already knew terror!
 
finally i found a neat guy who said that he would represent 
me. he was an annapolis grad, an ex navy jet fighter pilot who had been disabled 
in an airplane accident on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. we made a 
great team, two old, worn-out warriors who would go down in flames together!
 
so we filed the lawsuit. three days later my teenage kids 
told me that someone was stealing our garbage. someone was coming in at night 
and removing the garbage bags from the trash cans that were outside our house. 
my kids thought that this was neat. ã¢â¬åwe donã¢â¬â¢t have to take out the garbage any 
moreã¢â¬â, they joyfully joked with me.
 
then a week later, things got more interesting. i had a lot 
of teenagers living with me. there were five cars in the driveway. one morning 
my son woke me up, ã¢â¬ådad you had better come out and look at our carsã¢â¬â. all of 
the cars had been vandalized. the hoods were open, the trunks were open, the 
glove boxes were emptied, and all of the contents of the glove boxes were spread 
out evenly and neatly on the front seat of each car. was this a warning or what? 
 i realized that the next time all they had to do was plant a small package of 
drugs in one of the cars, call the police, and i would be headed for prison. 
things were getting serious.
 
then our first hearing in federal court in tampa came up. 
my attorney and i appeared, carrying a bundle of documents about 8 inches thick. 
the fed was represent by two very average looking attorneys who would not look 
at us. the judge was an attractive middle-aged woman. she looked like a class 
act. 
 
the hearing began. the federal reserve attorneys jumped up 
and down, emphatically saying over and over that the federal reserve bank was 
part of the government and could not be sued. my attorney calmly replied that he 
would provide documents that would establish our case, that the federal reserve 
was a private company, operating illegally in our state. he then provided the 
thick stack of documents to the court.
 
the lady judge glanced over the documents, then stated, ã¢â¬åi 
will review these documents and then rule on this case in about two weeksã¢â¬â.
 
we felt quite elated. we had expected that the case might 
be dismissed outright. we were aware of the pressures that must have been 
brought to bear of the judge to get rid of our case. my attorney had quipped, 
ã¢â¬åimagine the phone calls. by now, she is probably on a first name basis with people from the governorã¢â¬â¢s 
office and the white houseã¢â¬â. 
 
well in two weeks she ruled. she dismissed the case. she 
did not rule either for or against us. i have great respect for this woman. she 
would not do anything unfair. the facts of our lawsuit were valid. but she knew 
that we could not prevail. she probably guessed what would happen to us if our 
lawsuit continued. at this point, my attorney and i looked at each other, 
grinned, and said, ã¢â¬åwell thatã¢â¬â¢s thatã¢â¬â. we had tried. we had survived, which 
surprised a number of people.
 
[authorã¢â¬â¢s comment: some have said that my lawsuit against 
the federal reserve was the stupidest thing that i have ever done. others have 
said that it was my finest deed. what do you think?]
 
 
but it wasnã¢â¬â¢t over
 
several weeks later i was approached by some people who had 
been aware of what we were doing. they cautiously and carefully explained to me 
that others, with more power and backing, were also attempting to rectify the 
injustices of the federal reserve.
 
this it was that i was drawn into the most fascinating 
experience of my lifetime. i became a very minor participant in this movement. i 
have watched these patriots slowly but consistently win over the cabal. there 
are elements of our own military (i call them the white hats), as well as 
european, russian and oriental groups from japan and china. it has been a 
twenty-three year struggle. but we are winning. 
 
twenty-three years ago china did not have much influence in 
the world. things have sure changed, as china now emerges as a world superpower. 
their support has really helped the movement, especially since the world court 
can no longer ignore their influence. and they have used the world court 
effectively against the group that stole their national treasure.
 
i expect that this story will be old news and even ancient 
history by the time my grandchildren read this. i hope so. but i did want to 
tell you my part in it.
 
 
 
why china got 
involved
(never cheat a 
chinaman)
 
 
you may ask why china got involved in our struggle to 
overthrow the banking cabal.
 
here is the story. in the 1930ã¢â¬â¢s, japan invaded china. the 
japanese advanced rapidly, and soon controlled a large part of chinese 
territory. it was feared that they would soon reach the imperial courts where a 
vast amount of chinese treasure was stored. this included many thousands of tons 
of gold bullion, the result of thousands of years of accumulation.
 
china asked the united states for help. they wished to send 
their gold treasure to the usa for safekeeping. so the us navy sent seven us 
navy warships to china. all of the chinese imperial gold horde was loaded on the 
ships, and it was taken to the united states. it was taken to the federal 
reserve where it was placed in storage.
 
in return, the federal reserve gave china official us 
federal reserve gold certificates. the gold certificates were stored in special 
federal reserve storage trunks, each trunk clearly labelled with its contents. 
the gold certificates were for 60 years, fully redeemable at the 60 years with 
the return of the gold.
 
in the 1990ã¢â¬â¢s china duly presented the gold certificates 
for repayment of their gold. after some stonewalling, the federal reserve told 
the chinese government that the gold certificates were forgeries. the federal 
reserve refused to return the gold.
 
you can just imagine the reaction of the chinese. i have 
lived in the far east. i know how important face-saving is to the oriental 
cultures. to cheat or disgrace an oriental is to create an imbalance that will 
never be forgotten.
 
so when our federal reserve screwed the chinese government 
out of its trillions of dollarsã¢â¬â¢ worth of gold, it created a serious rift in all 
future dealings between the usa and china. but, fortunately, the chinese realize 
that the american people are not at fault. they know that we are all victims, 
chinese and americans. the chinese are a patient people. things have now 
changed. now china owns vast amounts of us debt, is accumulating a new horde of 
gold bullion by buying as much gold on the open market as it can, and is 
maneuvering to establish its currency (the yuan) as an internationally 
acceptable currency (to compete with the dollar?).
 
you cannot blame the chinese for not trusting us. and you 
cannot blame them for eventually seeking retribution for the theft of their 
national treasure. 
 
the arabs have a saying, ã¢â¬åthe enemy of my enemy is my 
friendã¢â¬â. so it is that china is friends with the countries and groups that 
oppose the cabal.  they have been instrumental in our success. thank you china.
