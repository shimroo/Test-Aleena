basic moves in apocalypse world! a quick & dirty thread for pbta designers! #pbtadesign
the other is an open letter re: powered by the apocalypse:
dear friends, fellow designers, critics, and concerned citizens,
it was a going topic, not to say a sore point, at gen con, so please allow meg and me to define once and for all what "powered by the apocalypse" is.
i'm always happy to answer questions, so if you've got 'em, feel free!0 commentsthread 857: from the top2017-09-01 : systems in miniaturein rise of the videogame zinesters, my unrivaled favorite book of game thinkery, anna anthropy puts forward this thesis*:
just as we draw pictures to examine, explore, understand, or explain things, and just as we write poems to examine, explore, understand, or explain feelings, so we create games to examine, explore, understand, or explain dynamic systems.
sketch the line at the rmv and you learn something about what it is; write a poem about the line at the rmv and you learn something about how it feels; design a game about the line at the rmv and you learn something about how it works.
i have kind of a lot to say about some of our games - games that meg and i have designed, games that our friends have designed. what i want to say, follows from this idea of anna's, so i'm starting here.
but even more, i think that this idea of anna's is important and good, and i recommend her book. she says that we should all design games, basically all the time, basically whenever we meet a dynamic system and we want to tell someone else about it or understand it better than we do.6 comments (6 new)thread 856: from the top; first comment2017-08-28 : vigilover at his patreon, ron edwards has just released the very first playtest/notes document for vigil [patrons only], a superhero game he's working on. i got to try it out at gencon, and holy mac am i excited for it.
in full, sober honesty, i've never once actually cared about a superhero before now.
here's the deal: we sit down and we choose something that we all honestly hate, in real life. in our game, it was debt used as an instrument of violent control. which seems a little abstract when i write it out, but you should just feel my blood boiling over here.
then we create our characters. before we start, as an absolute given, we know two things about them:
first, they have broken the law and will break the law to fight debt as an instrument of violent control. given.
second, they're living a double life: a workaday life and a vigilante life. given.
so here's me, and i'm like, you are too goddamn right i've broken the law and will keep breaking the law to fight debt as an instrument of violent control! and i have this rising enraged coil of light inside me, and a few minutes later i have this character i can channel it into. i'm white-knuckled and grinning.
anyhow, ron's got a ton of work to put into this game still, and i want him to have the time and space to do it, badly, and we all have this grinding erosion of time and space we have to contend with all the time. back his patreon if you can!2 comments (2 new)thread 855: from the top; first comment2017-08-09 : shays' rebellion3 comments (3 new)thread 854: from the top; first comment2017-08-01 : apocalypse world is in print again0 commentsthread 853: from the top2017-07-25 : #rpgtheoryjuly: violence in my games5 comments (5 new)thread 852: from the top; first comment2017-06-24 : roleplaying is a conversation?18 comments (18 new)thread 851: from the top; first comment2017-06-07 : failure in rpgs (by paganini)20 comments (20 new)thread 850: from the top; first comment2016-12-12 : love, warmth, good will, etc.0 commentsthread 849: from the top2016-11-20 : butt trumpets0 commentsthread 848: from the top2016-07-26 : amazons!0 commentsthread 847: from the top2016-06-07 : core tension0 commentsthread 846: from the top2016-05-31 : fallen london again7 comments (7 new)thread 845: from the top; first comment complete index & archives
