 jonathon turley: ... on friday, vice president jd vance gave a historic defense of free speech  at the munich security conference. in front of a clearly hostile assemblage of european diplomats, vance confronted our allies with their systemic censorship as they demanded more support to “defend democracy.” for the free speech community, it was akin to ronald reagan’s call : “mr. gorbachev, tear down this wall!” vance questioned how our allies could claim to be the bastions of freedom while denying free expression to their citizens. he then delivered this haymaker: “if you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing america can do for you. nor, for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the american people that elected me and elected president trump.” not surprisingly, the europeans sat on their hands while glaring at vance for calling them out for their hypocrisy. german defense minister boris pistorius declared vance’s remarks were “not acceptable.” an unn...

 newsmax: president donald trump's border czar says he can't remember fewer illegal southern border crossings than what's occurring after nearly one month of the new administration. tom homan took to social media monday to give a status update on the u.s.-mexico border, which saw a record number of illegal crossings under former president joe biden. "in the last 24 hours the u.s. border patrol has encountered a total of 229 aliens across the entire southwest border. that is down from a high of over 11,000 a day under biden. i started as a border patrol agent in 1984, and i don't remember the numbers ever being that low. president trump promised a secure border and he is delivering," homan posted on x . arrests for illegal crossings have fallen dramatically from an all-time monthly high of 250,000 in december 2023, perhaps most strikingly in the rio grande valley, the epicenter for migrant arrivals from 2013 to 2022. associated press journalists accompanying bo...

 blaze: a united states customs and border protection agent stands accused of being a mexican drug cartel member who exploited his position to smuggle illegal aliens into the country. cbp officer manuel perez jr., 32, was terminated from the agency when he was arrested on federal human- and drug-smuggling charges on february 8, according to the el paso times . perez, a u.s. citizen born in california, was stationed at the paso del norte international bridge in el paso, texas. if found guilty, he could face up to a decade in prison. a special agent with the cbp office of professional responsibility testified that perez was a member of a drug cartel. “multiple witnesses said he belonged to la linea cartel in mexico,” the special agent stated. the agent explained that intercepted phone calls from smugglers promised a “100% guaranteed” border crossing, claiming that they had “the officer in their pocket.” perez’s lawyer, ruben ortiz, claimed that the alleged co-conspirators could be ly...

 trending politics: calls are growing for a federal judge who blocked part of president donald trump’s agenda to rescind his ruling after his spouse was found to have personally benefitted from some of the programs the president has been trying to shutter. news of the curious connection came out last week after u.s. district judge john bates paused president trump’s scrubbing of government-run websites promoting gender ideology, an overhaul that comes as part of his effort to dismantle the united states agency for international development, or usaid. the executive order targeting “gender ideology extremism” was in the crosshairs of bates, who wrote that the government would be unable to provide a remedy to affected individuals “during an appointment time to a patient who cannot return in the future.” bates’ ruling is among more than a dozen that have stymied president trump’s early efforts to scuttle large swaths of the federal bureaucracy. the decisions, in turn, have sparked wide...

 the hill: ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky is leveraging the country’s large deposits of rare earth materials and critical minerals to win the favor of president trump ahead of high-stakes negotiations to end russia’s war of aggression. trump said wednesday that russian president vladimir putin agreed to begin negotiations immediately, with plans to meet in saudi arabia. trump’s top officials are in europe this week huddling with ukrainian and european officials on plans to end the war. ukraine is offering itself as a reliable partner in the global competition for key mineral resources – if occupying russian forces are ousted from ukrainian territory where some of these resources are located. “we have a lot of rare sources, rare materials, which is crucially important for weapon production. we explained to our colleagues as now, under russian control, our eastern part, where there are a lot of these resources,” lesia zaburranna, a ukrainian member of parliament, told the hil...

  trending politics: northwestern conservatives leading the charge to secede their red, rural counties from a reliably blue state got a boost to their efforts over the weekend as a republican lawmaker promised to officialize an investigation into making their dream a reality. for years, the greater idaho movement has stagnated as 13 of oregon’s reddest counties have rowed together to try and separate their homes from places like portland, an epicenter of violent black lives matter riots in the summer of 2020. now, legislation has been filed to explore the details of how residents may do so. state rep. mark owens, r-malheur, filed hb 3844, which would establish and direct a task force to explore extending the idaho border into eastern oregon. a final report would be compiled and presented to lawmakers in salem, according to fox news . greater idaho president mike mccarter said in a statement to the outlet: “we are encouraged to see the representatives of eastern oregon coming togeth...

 the federalist wire: a staffer from elon musk’s department of government efficiency (doge) reportedly arrived thursday at the headquarters of the internal revenue service (irs) to review the agency’s operations, sources told reuters. gavin kliger, the doge aide, reportedly requested a description of what each irs business unit does, what it plans to deliver in the next 90 days and what risks each unit currently faces, according  to the outlet, citing two people familiar with the matter. it is unclear whether klinger accessed any irs systems, but sources told  cnn he was just “getting a lay of the land at the moment.” “the internal revenue service will be looked at like everybody else. just about everybody’s going to be looked at. they’re doing a hell of a job. it’s an amazing job they’re doing,” president donald trump told reporters thursday. he clarified he does not plan to “close” the irs. “that force he’s building — i call it ‘the force of super-geniuses’ … they’re very smart p...

 red state: house minority leader hakeem jeffries (d-ny) appeared on abc news’ “this week” on sunday and proceeded to blame donald trump for every problem the united states faces despite the fact that the new commander-in-chief has been in office less than a month and the democrats were in power for most of the last four years. ok, hakeem. after describing how jeffries droned on about the high cost of living and how it was trump’s fault, my colleague becca lower  wrote : trump has been in office for  just over three weeks . unless someone invents a time machine for him to hop into and correct the liberals' mismanagement and malfeasance, what dems are suggesting is fantasy on its face. as innovative as elon musk is, i wouldn't suggest holding your breath for him to get that sort of contraption on the assembly line at tesla or spacex.  perhaps the most priceless moment in the interview came when host john karl read some reality to jeffries in the form of cold, hard num...

  the federalist wire: ... vice president jd vance and his communications director pushed back on friday after the wall street journal published what they called a misrepresentation of vance’s comments regarding the war between russia and ukraine. the wsj article suggested that vance had issued a direct threat to russia, implying that he was using the prospect of u.s. military intervention to pressure russian president vladimir putin into agreeing to a peace deal. “vance wields threat of sanctions, military action to push putin into ukraine deal,” the headline stated. a social media post promoting the article struck a similar chord: “exclusive: vance pledged to hit russia with sanctions and potentially military action if putin won’t agree to a peace deal that guarantees ukraine’s independence.” ... william martin, vance’s communications director, quickly responded with a firm denial, sharing the actual transcript of the vice president’s remarks: “this is pure fake news. compare the...

 fox news: u.s. department of housing and urban development (hud) secretary scott turner announced a new department of government efficiency  task force on thursday to "eliminate waste, fraud and abuse" at his federal agency. doge revealed that $1.9 billion in hud money had been recovered as of friday, saying the funds were misplaced during the biden administration and were "earmarked for the administration of financial services, but were no longer needed." doge said it worked with turner to release the funds, and they are now available for use by the u.s. department of treasury. turner said hud launched its own doge task force to review how the agency is spending taxpayer money. hud employees will lead the task force with a mission to maximize their budget and efficiency, reporting their findings directly to turner. expert reveals massive levels of waste doge can slash from entitlements, pet projects: 'a lot of fat' "hud will be detailed and deliberate...

february 17, 2025








 blaze: ... throughout much of biden’s political career, his family members — his brother james and his son hunter — worked in political consulting. their roles raise questions about the appearance of evil, as neither seemed to possess unique skills or expertise beyond their close ties to biden as a senator, vice president, and president. as an example, hunter biden was paid as much as $1 million in a year  to serve on the board of burisma, the ukrainian natural gas company. such payments are eye-popping given that hunter had no relevant expertise in that business. the natural inference would be that he was paid such a large amount so that burisma would benefit from joe biden’s power and influence. in one case, the u.s. ambassador to italy expressed discomfort  that the son of a sitting u.s. vice president was lobbying italy on behalf of the ukrainian firm. the common response to these concerns is that joe biden was not fully aware of his son’s activities. perhaps that is true, but...
