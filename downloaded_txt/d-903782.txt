we are a group of buddhist centres and organisations who follow the path of lord buddha in accordance with the wishes of his holiness, the 14th dalai lama. our practice is centred on the system known as 'lam rim' - the graduated path, as founded by the indian master atisha and then arranged in a beautiful and accessible manner by je rinpoche - lama tsongkhapa.
"if you train in lam rim, you will be training in the complete body of the path, which includes all the vital points of sutra and mantra. as a result, your attainment of a precious human life will have been worthwhile and you will be able to extend the lord buddha's precious teaching within the minds of both yourself and of others." - je rinpoche
