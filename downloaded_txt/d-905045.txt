the measure of latino politics








there is no lack of respected economists who consider the united  states to be not only in an economic crisis but in a crisis of  governance as well.5 as noted, the policies and ideology of  neoliberalism have clearly undermined the quality of life for millions  of people. unemployment has reached record levels, millions have lost  their homes, social services have been either eliminated or severely  limited, most cities and many states are either on the verge of  bankruptcy and unable to deal with crumbling infrastructure, faltering  educational systems, and inadequate medical facilities. this is the  legacy of the neoliberal policies. and yet there is no prospect of  removing these polices from the national political agenda. 

latino communities' particular pattern of growth and development have  made them particularly susceptible to these effects.there have of  course been very significant advances made by sectors of latino  communities as a result of the changes brought about by the civil rights  movements and legislation of the 1960s. a small but significant  professional class has emerged that often plays the role of a broker,  articulating their version of latino "issues" and "needs" for mainstream  institutions. and the proportion of latinos who have achieved  middle-class status has increased significantly. but a majority still  are relatively marginalized. as i mentioned above, the period of  significant growth in the latino population overlapped considerably with  the period during which neoliberalism developed in the united states.  this is no coincidence: satisfying the demand for cheap labor was one of  the central features of neoliberal restructuring, which promoted  large-scale immigration, attracting workers from mexico in particular.

given the size and dispersion of latino populations and the key role  they played in several sectors of the economy, they became an integral  part of the neoliberal transformation. in the last decade alone, the  latino population grew 42% and is expected to number weu over 50 miuion  when the 2010 census is completed; latinos are projected to compose more  than a quarter of the national population by 2050. so it is clear that  this population will continue to have an increasing effect on  determining what kind of society the united states will become. because  of this, the economic and political conditions of latino communities and  their capacity to become full and equal members of society has to be a  national concern and not treated as a "minority" issue. this is  particularly clear when one looks at the fact that 20% of schoolchildren  and 25% of newborns are latino. when combined with statistics that show  that latinos between the ages 16 and 25 have a school dropout rate of  17% - almost twice the figure for african americans and nearly three  times that of whites - the demographic trends portend an alarming future  of even greater fragmentation, division, and inequalities, with ae the  ills and costs that these conditions entail.

economically, latinos have been directly affected by neoliberal  policies. a 2009 report published by the national council of la raza,  indicates that in 2007, 42% of latino workers earned poverty level-wages  (or about $10.20 per hour to support a family of four), compared to 34%  for african american workers and 22% for white workers.7 and latinos  tend to be concentrated in occupations that are not only on the lower  end of the wage scale, with latino men earning 68% of white male wages  and latinas 77% of the wages of white women. they are also  overrepresented in jobs that have been particularly hard hit by the  ongoing recession, with a little more than 20% in production and food  service jobs, close to a one third in construction and maintenance, and  almost 40% in agriculture. the afl-cio reports significant job loss in  many of these occupations with higher percentages of latinos during the  period between 2001 and 2005. so, for example, there were 289,000 (20%)  jobs lost in machinery, 220,000 (47%) in apparel, 58,500 (13%) in  furniture products, 260,100 (37%) in semiconductor and electronic  components, 235,200 (13%) in fabricated metal products, 144, 800 (24%)  in primary metals, 159,300 (20%) in printing, and the list goes on.

in addition, 48% of latino workers had no health insurance through  their employment, compared to 27% of white workers and 32.9% of african  american workers. and two thirds (65%) of latino workers did not have  access to retirement plans in their jobs. at a more general level, a  recent measure called the hispanic inequality index has documented the  level of inequality of latinos. using a number of statistical indices  comparing latinos to whites in five different areas, including economic  standing, social justice, civic engagement, education, and health, the  analysis concluded that the overall inequality index for latinos is 72%,  and most pronounced in the areas of economics and social justice.

significant differences in class and race








immigrant status, gender,  and national origin make the development of a single "latino" agenda  extremely unlikely. that is to say, the particular interests and needs  of latinos, as with other groups, differ according to their location  along these lines. yet, despite these differences, there are structural  processes, policies, and practices that do affect the opportunities,  trajectories of economic and social mobility, and life conditions of  large numbers of latinos. the literature on neoliberalism provides a way  to identify and understand some of the key domestic structural  phenomena and conditions within which latino politics now takes place. 

neoliberalism has been used to describe the linkage between, on the one  hand, the changes in the structure of economic processes and relations  that were promoted beginning in the late 1970s in response to the  ineffectiveness of postwar keynesian policies, and on the other hand,  the institutional and ideological practices and political policies of  governance that were developed to address the inability of state  structures to address these problems.1 these new policies not only  guided the extensive and long-term restructuring processes adopted  within both the economic and state spheres, but also coincided with the  period of dramatic and rapid growth in the u.s. latino population.

the key characteristics of neoliberalism are well-known and have been  documented in numerous studies. this does not imply, however, that there  is a consensus on the meaning of the term, the interpretation of its  characteristics, or the particular significance of its various  components. the extensive literature on neoliberalism reflects a broad  range of frameworks and an emphasis on different dimensions involved in  these processes. some studies focus on a set of economic policies,  others use neoliberalism to define a particular historical period, and  still others study it as an ideological phenomenon. in the context of  latino politics, it is useful to focus on how  neoliberal economic policies and their consequences have severely  limited the possibility that political action channeled through the  electoral process alone can seriously address the marginalized  conditions that most latinos face. 

neoliberalism  is based on the assumption that an unregulated, free market is the most  effective mechanism not only for economic and societal development but  also for promoting democracy and freedom. all of the other defining  characteristics of neoliberalism flow from these basic assumptions.  deregulating industry and commerce in general, limiting the role of  government in economic affairs, privatization, reducing governmental  responsibility for social services and community welfare - all of these  are policies intended to achieve the ideal of a free market as the  foundation for economic prosperity and democratization.

yet, despite the fact that this view has been the guiding framework for  the structure of governance since the reagan era, neoliberalism has  functioned more as utopian ideology than grounded public policy, as  david harvey suggests.3 the spectacular failure of this ideology that  led to the economic crisis beginning in 2008 clearly demonstrated that  neoliberalism does not reject government intervention in economic  affairs, but rather government intervention on behalf of the working  class and minorities. the role of government under this neoliberal  regime has been to promote, enhance, and facilitate the growth of  corporate and financial sectors, while limiting support for social  services, education, health and welfare. the societal effects of this  have led some to call neoliberalism "predatory capitalism." the  redistribution of wealth upward and the growing level of inequality in  the united states has been so dramatic that even conservative thinkers  like kevin phillips, in his wealth and democracy, have warned of the  dire consequences.

one of the major effects of  neoliberalism has been the redefinition of the purpose of governance  that emerged from the period of the depression and lasted through the  early 1970s. during the former period, policies were aimed at putting  people back to work, addressing the issue of poverty, increasing the  standard of living, establishing strict regulatory regimes (reflected in  legislation like the glass-steagall act) to prevent another economic  collapse, strengthening the rights of labor, establishing a system of  social security to ensure a minimum of economic well-being, dismantling  of legal structures of racial discrimination and support for the  expansion of civil rights, and establishing a health care system  intended to make sure that the elderly and poor would receive care.

this contrasts markedly with the policies advanced not only by  republicans but also by democrats like president clinton, who pushed  through nafta primarily to open capital markets across borders, relied  heavily on tax credits for the wealthy as a basis for influencing  economic development, advanced legislation to dismantle the welfare  system, and embraced deregulation - supporting the repeal of the  glass-steagall act, which many commentators blame for the unleashing of  die very kind of market behavior that led to the near collapse of the  entire financial system. today, this has not changed much - the policies  of the obama administration are designed and promoted by advisers who  come from the very same companies and sectors who orchestrated that near  collapse. thus, the conception of governance as the guarantor of the  corporate class remains largely unchanged.

there  is little to indicate that either of the two major parties is likely  embrace anything other than the neoliberal repertoire of policies.  although latino voters helped stave off republican victories in the  midterm elections, the ideological parameters within which the dominant  public discourse and public policy options are advanced was hardly  challenged. this is not to suggest that voting and electoral behavior  are unimportant - quite the contrary. electoral victories have been an  important vehicle for promoting progressive legislation in the past,  legislation that has promoted greater levels of latino incorporation.  but in the last 30 years, there have been few instances when either  party seriously challenged the fundamental premises of neoliberalism.  for this reason, latino poitical efforts need to focus on supporting the  kinds of changes that would make an alternative possible. this cannot  be achieved by latinos acting alone. but the mobilization of millions of  people who came together to support the vision and hope that they  believed obama represented makes it clear that a politics based on providing an alternative to neoliberalism is indeed possible.

the structuring of latino politics








as the 2010 midterm congressional elections approached, attention to  the role of latinos in the electoral process increased accordingly.  this is a familiar pattern, not only in the popular media, both the  english and spanish versions, but also among mainstream academics and  political organizations. the format and framing of these works represent  a continuation of the approach adopted by the numerous studies that  have documented the growth and behavior in the latino electorate,  particularly since the early 1990s. these concerns focus on turnout,  partisan loyalties and attitudes, pending or ongoing policy issues,  elections or electability of latino candidates, identifying local,  statewide, and national elections in which latino voters have the  potential be the "swing" vote, etc. although researchers differ in their  assessments of the success or failure of these efforts, the underlying  assumption of the vast majority of these studies is that the electoral  process in the u.s. has the potential to promote the "interests" of  latino communities. 
yet there are few efforts to  situate these electoral processes within their broader structural  context. the result is a truncated and limited view of latino politics.  although latino electoral behaviors and trends are important phenomena,  they do not occur in an institutional vacuum, and they represent only  one dimension of latino politics, which  encompasses a much broader terrain defined by the multiple levels and  forms by which latinos act politically. a wide range of actions are  undertaken by latino community and neighborhood groups, community-based  organizations, nonprofit organizations, home associations, immigrant  rights groups, student organizations, labor groups (often linked to  domestic and other non-unionized service sectors), and professional  organizations to advance their concerns and to affect policies and  practices of both state structures and institutions of civil society  within which their daily lives are carried out. 
the kinds of actions undertaken and policies promoted by these kinds of organizations imply a normative concept of latino politics  that has as its ultimate goal the full incorporation in all spheres of  u.s. society and that views electoral behavior as an indispensable but  also limited mechanism for pursuing this goal. it is this dimension of  full incorporation, then, rather than any particular pattern of  electoral behavior, that should be the measure of success in latino politics.  what is most often missing from works that emphasize the primacy of  electoral activity is any sustained and detailed discussion of how  electoral behavior is linked to this more fundamental question of  incorporation. and the discourse that focuses most directly on the level  and nature of incorporation is that of political membership and  citizenship. so it is really the issue of full and effective citizenship  that provides the underlying normativity of latino politics that is typically not addressed in studies or discussions of latino electoral activity or patterns. 
the challenge, then, is to develop modes of analysis that incorporate this broader conception of latino politics  and to understand how state, economic, and cultural power both affect  the degree of latino incorporation and often limit the possibilities and  strategies for social and political change. we must, in other words,  locate today's latino politics within the context of the neoliberal agenda, which has sought to define economic and political policies since the late 1970s.

ideology and power in the middle east








ideology and power in the middle east:  studies in honor of george lenczowski, peter j. chelkowski and robert j.  pranger, editors. durham, nc: duke university press, 1988. 530 pages.  $19.95 paperback.the editors of this  compilation of essays in honor of george lenczowski, former professor of  political science at the university of california at berkeley (best  known as the conservative author of russia and the west in iran, the  middle east in world affairs and oil and state in the middle east,  originally published in 1949, 1952 and 1960 respectively), declare in  their preface that this is not a conventional festschrift. indeed, the  connection between lenczowski and most of the contributors appears  rather tenuous. similarly, the attempt made in the title and an  introductory essay to draw a common theme of "ideology and power" around  the disparate contributions seems somewhat artificial.it  is true that the typically esoteric melange of the usual festschrift is  not to be found in these presentations. at the same time, however, the  quintessential and enduring merit of the festschrift form, viz., an  eclectic if random originality, has been sacrificed for  comprehensiveness. the result is, essentially, a textbook -- and a  decidedly hefty one at that, weighing in with 450 pages of text but with  all the notes inconveniently pushed to the rear. as a consequence, the  contributions tend to be uniform but largely undistinguished surveys of  recent developments in selected countries and movements. many of the  authors have covered the same ground elsewhere in more detail and with  more authority.country studies are in  the majority, arranged into sections on "royalist authoritarianism"  (pavlavi iran, saudi arabia, jordan and bahrain); "radical and reformist  military regimes" (egypt, syria, iraq and north yemen); "marxist  movements and governments" (south yemen, afghanistan and the people's  mujahidin of iran); and "challenge to democratic practices and  principles" (israel, turkey and lebanon). final chapters deal with  "islamic fundamentalism," the plo, the kurds, and overviews of  international relations in the gulf and american foreign policy in the  middle east.among the few contributions  that stand out are hermann eilts' crisply written personal perspective  on political and social change in saudi arabia, and robert springborg's  meditation on politics in modern egypt through his review and critical  analysis of the scholarly literature. also on the positive side, it  should be noted that there are few, if any, "clunkers" among the  nineteen essays and that all the authors are thoroughly familiar with  their subjects. thus, this volume may serve admirably as a supplementary  undergraduate text or as a reasonably current shelf reference.

"... and answer came there none ..."








isn’t crooked timber amazing? aren’t we all fortunate to live in an era when such mighty intellectual machinery can be set in motion to tackle what is, quite obviously, by far the single most important and interesting question about the death of the hamas godfather ahmed yassin? and what might that question be? it's this: is “removal” quite the mot juste for the manner of yassin's going, or is “assassination” the “correct” word because - er, well, because one of the writers at crooked timber asserts that it is? come now: how can anyone fail to be deeply impressed by such sophistication (whether that's to be understood in its 18th-century sense or in its 21st-century sense being, of course, another matter)? how can any of the rest of us bear to go on blogging at all when the greatest minds of the blogosphere have already said all that there is to say?
