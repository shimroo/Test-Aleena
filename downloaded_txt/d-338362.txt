hello again, anticrafters!

this project is such fucking emotional whiplash! my apologies; i don't like it either. but! we are still here! turns out it was indeed crossed wires, and yes, this host (lenticular host) should be our home for a while if not ever. (you can't really say "forever" when it comes to things like this, i think, but you get what i mean.)

i should have some time this winter to get back on the cleanup wagon here. i wonder if i'll finish...?

see y'all around!
