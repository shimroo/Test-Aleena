texas
         history,
         to the average person, is mostly the story of the pioneer
         cattle lndustry; the trail drives and roundups. we know that
         there's more to it than that, but the western cattle range
         still dominates the image people have of texas in the 1866
        through 1890 period.
it is no mystery how the
         image got started or why it grew and persisted. it was an
         exciting and colorful period. the people in the stories were
         bold and vigorous.
it took great courage and
         skill to gather the wild and dangerous texas longhorns and
         drive them hundreds of miles to northern markets. it was not
         a job for the inept or the chicken-hearted. the trails are
         lined with unmarked graves. small wonder, then, that the
         old-time cowhand took pride in his exploits.
this
         chart has over 200 of the most famous and significant brands
         of the period along with the registration dates,counties and
         owners.
 here are examples
         from spanish colonial times through the early days of the
         twentieth century, representing great cattle empires such as
         the four 6's, the matador, the running w, and the long rail.
        as well as the "road brands" of the trail drivers.
here, too, are the
           ''irons" of the men of whom the legends tell: col. charles
           goodnight, john slaughter, shanghai pierce and john
           blocker.
these hand-drawn brands
         are printed in dark brown on museum quality tan paper, ready
         for mounting.

where
         brands of the cattle kings 
         came from
of the many brands of the cattle kings, 
there are some very exceptional stories 
associated with their owners and origination 
of the brands. 
         
an excerpt from one such story follows. 

 
the xit iron
by tom burks

         former curator of texas ranger museum
in
         1879, the texas legislature passed a law setting aside
         3,000,000 acres of state land for the construction of a new
         capitol. at that time, texas had plenty of public land but
         little cash. since this huge block of land was to be traded
         for construction, a committee was appointed to oversee the
         bidding, evaluate the bidders and award the contract to a
         firm that would be capable of such a large
         undertaking.
they chose a chicago group
         which became known as "the capitol syndicate." the group
         agreed to construct a capitol building that would be bigger
         and grander than that of another state; it was to rival the
         national capitol in washington (its dome would be seven feet
         higher!).
the land the syndicate
         received was in the northwest corner of the panhandle,
         stretching 200 miles south along the new mexico line. in
         some places it was as much as twenty-five miles
         wide.
their intention was to
         create a giant ranching operation that would produce an
         income until the region was ready for settlement, then to
         sell the land in smaller parcels to farmers and
         stockmen........

                  predating the entry of texas into the united
                  states, the texas rangers came into being as a
                  ragtag outfit of frontiersmen who battled a host of
                  enemies, from mexican soldiers to comanche indians
                  to anglo outlaws, and who were not often scrupulous
                  about method--or the niceties of law. the
