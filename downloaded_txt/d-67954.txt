stepping forward“the annual rehab council symposium is a good place to learn about and understand what's coming up next and find emerging technology for doctors in the field. at the 2022 symposium we saw many familiar vendors that are branching out into new specialty equipment, and we had several new brands. i felt energized and invigorated being all together again. the speakers ignited many useful ideas.”jeffrey tucker, dc, dacrbpast president, aca rehab council
