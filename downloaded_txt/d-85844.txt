welcome to family beginnings 























 
















building a healthy familyone pregnancy at a time 












dr. donahue and the team at family beginnings pc have over 20 years experience providing infertility care to the people of central indiana. as the pioneer of many reproductive technology “firsts” in indiana, we aim to be the most innovative practice in the state. we were the first to perform a blastocyst transfer in 1998, the first to do a gift procedure at a catholic hospital, and now the first to document a pregnancy with invocell in 2017. in keeping with current technology, we offer in-vitro fertilization (ivf) with pre-implantation genetic testing (pgt). our goal is to offer the most affordable and successful procedures to help our patients grow their families.

			“we couldn’t have had a better experience than we did with dr donahue at family beginnings. after going to two other clinics prior to family beginnings, it was a relief to receive compassionate and quality care with attention to detail.”
