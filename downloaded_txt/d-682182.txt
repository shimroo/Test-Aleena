vacation





sigh.i've been thinking about doing this for a while.right now my priorities need to be preparing for the expansion of our family and that includes all sorts of not-fun but practical things like washing stored baby clothes and cleaning our apartment and car. and i feel like our routine's been getting off-track (if we ever really had one) so while blogging is not something that consumes a lot of my time, crossing it off the list is a way to make me feel like i don't have this specter hanging over my head, where i feel guilty for not blogging for days or even weeks or months. after the second baby comes, we've also both committed to getting ourselves in shape so that at this time next year, we'll be half the people we are now.i might, in the future, kick off a new blog, take it in a new direction, maybe on a new server (i.e., wordpress). i might combine this into a blog with my personal one, making it a big mega blog. we'll see. but don't count on anything until late summer or fall at the earliest. more likely than not, it'll be after the new year. when i do make a decision, it will be published here.thanks to all of you who've read and commented over the years. my prayers are with you and i'd appreciate continue prayers for me.thanks.

readings for the second sunday of easter





 reading 1acts 4:32-35the community of believers was of one heart  and mind,and no one claimed that any of his  possessions was his own,but they had everything in common.with great power the apostles bore witnessto the resurrection of the lord jesus,and great favor was accorded them all.there was no needy person among them,for those who owned property or houses  would sell them,bring the proceeds of the sale,and put them at the feet of the apostles,and they were distributed  to each according to need.  responsorial psalm ps 118:2-4, 13-15, 22-24    r. (1) give  thanks to the lord, for he is good, his love is everlasting.or:r. alleluia.let the house of israel say,"his mercy endures forever."let the house of aaron say,"his mercy endures forever."let those who fear the lord say,"his mercy endures forever."r. give thanks to the lord, for he is good, his  love is everlasting.or:r. alleluia.i was hard pressed and was falling,but the lord helped me.my strength and my courage is the lord,and he has been my savior.the joyful shout of victoryin the tents of the just:r. give thanks to the lord, for he is good, his  love is everlasting.or:r. alleluia.the stone which the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone.by the lord has this been done;it is wonderful in our eyes.this is the day the lord has made;let us be glad and rejoice in it.r. give thanks to the lord, for he is good, his  love is everlasting.or:r. alleluia.  reading ii 1 jn 5:1-6 beloved:everyone who believes that jesus is the  christ is begotten by god,and everyone who loves the fatherloves also the one begotten by him.in this way we know that we love the  children of godwhen we love god and obey his commandments.for the love of god is this,that we keep his commandments.and his commandments are not burdensome,for whoever is begotten by god conquers the  world.and the victory that conquers the world is  our faith.who indeed is the victor over the worldbut the one who believes that jesus is the  son of god? this is the one who came through water and  blood, jesus christ,  not by water alone, but by water and blood.  the spirit is the one that testifies,  and the spirit is truth.   gospel jn 20:19-31     on the evening of that first day of the  week,when the doors were locked, where the  disciples were,for fear of the jews,jesus came and stood in their midstand said to them, "peace be with you."when he had said this, he showed them his  hands and his side.the disciples rejoiced when they saw the  lord.jesus said to them again, "peace be with  you.as the father has sent me, so i send you."and when he had said this, he breathed on  them and said to them,"receive the holy spirit.whose sins you forgive are forgiven them,and whose sins you retain are retained." thomas, called didymus, one of the twelve,  was not with them when jesus came.  so the other disciples said to him, "we  have seen the lord."  but he said to them,  "unless i see the mark of the nails in his  hands  and put my finger into the nailmarks  and put my hand into his side, i will not  believe." now a week later his disciples were again  inside  and thomas was with them.  jesus came, although the doors were locked,  and stood in their midst and said, "peace  be with you."  then he said to thomas, "put your finger here  and see my hands,  and bring your hand and put it into my  side,  and do not be unbelieving, but believe."  thomas answered and said to him, "my lord  and my god!"  jesus said to him, "have you come to  believe because you have seen me?  blessed are those who have not seen and  have believed." now jesus did many other signs in the  presence of his disciples  that are not written in this book.  but these are written that you may come to  believe  that jesus is the christ, the son of god,  and that through this  belief you may have life in his name.

readings for the first sunday of lent





 reading 1gn 9:8-15god said to noah and to his sons with him:"see, i am now establishing my covenant  with youand your descendants after youand with every living creature that was  with you:all the birds, and the various tame and  wild animalsthat were with you and came out of the ark.i will establish my covenant with you,that never again shall all bodily creatures  be destroyedby the waters of a flood;there shall not be another flood to  devastate the earth."god added:"this is the sign that i am giving for all  ages to come,of the covenant between me and youand every living creature with you:i set my bow in the clouds to serve as a  signof the covenant between me and the earth.when i bring clouds over the earth,and the bow appears in the clouds,i will recall the covenant i have madebetween me and you and all living beings,so that the waters shall never again become  a floodto destroy all mortal  beings."  responsorial psalm ps 25:4-5, 6-7, 8-9   r. (cf. 10) your ways, o lord, are love and truth to those who keep your covenant.your ways, o lord, make known to me;teach me your paths,guide me in your truth and teach me,for you are god my savior.r.your  ways, o lord, are love and truth to those who keep your covenant.remember that your compassion, o lord,and your love are from of old.in your kindness remember me,because of your goodness, o lord.r. your  ways, o lord, are love and truth to those who keep your covenant.good and upright is the lord,thus he shows sinners the way.he guides the humble to justice,and he teaches the humble his way.r. your ways, o lord, are love and  truth to those who keep your covenant. reading ii 1 pt 3:18-22 beloved:christ suffered for sins once,the righteous for the sake of the  unrighteous,that he might lead you to god.put to death in the flesh,he was brought to life in the spirit.in it he also went to preach to the spirits  in prison,who had once been disobedientwhile god patiently waited in the days of  noahduring the building of the ark,in which a few persons, eight in all,were saved through water.this prefigured baptism, which saves you  now.it is not a removal of dirt from the bodybut an appeal to god for a clear  conscience,through the resurrection of jesus christ,who has gone into heavenand is at the right hand of god,with angels, authorities,  and powers subject to him. gospel mk 1:12-15     the spirit drove jesus out into the desert,and he remained in the desert for forty  days,tempted by satan.he was among wild beasts,and the angels ministered to him. after john had been arrested,  jesus came to galilee  proclaiming the gospel of god:  "this is the time of fulfillment.  the kingdom of god  is at hand.  repent, and believe in the  gospel."

readings for the seventh sunday of ordinary time





reading 1is 43:18-19, 21-22, 24b-25thus says the lord:remember not the events of the past,the things of long ago consider not;see, i am doing something new!now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?in the desert i make a way,in the wasteland, rivers.the people i formed for myself,that they might announce my praise.yet you did not call upon me, o jacob,for you grew weary of me, o israel.you burdened me with your sins,and wearied me with your crimes.it is i, i, who wipe out,for my own sake, your offenses;your sins i remember no more.responsorial psalmps 41:2-3, 4-5, 13-14r. (5b) lord, heal my soul, for i have sinned against you.blessed is the one who has regard for the lowly and the poor;in the day of misfortune the lord will deliver him.the lord will keep and preserve him;and make him blessed on earth,and not give him over to the will of his enemies.r. lord, heal my soul, for i have sinned against you.the lord will help him on his sickbed,he will take away all his ailment when he is ill.once i said, "o lord, have pity on me;heal me, though i have sinned against you."r. lord, heal my soul, for i have sinned against you.but because of my integrity you sustain meand let me stand before you forever.blessed be the lord, the god of israel,from all eternity. amen. amen.r. lord, heal my soul, for i have sinned against you.reading ii2 cor 1:18-22brothers and sisters:as god is faithful,our word to you is not "yes" and "no."for the son of god, jesus christ,who was proclaimed to you by us, silvanus and timothy and me,was not "yes" and "no," but "yes" has been in him.for however many are the promises of god, their yes is in him;therefore, the amen from us also goes through him to god for glory.but the one who gives us security with you in christand who anointed us is god;he has also put his seal upon usand given the spirit in our hearts as a first installment.gospelmk 2:1-12when jesus returned to capernaum after some days,it became known that he was at home.many gathered together so that there was no longer room for them,not even around the door,and he preached the word to them.they came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.unable to get near jesus because of the crowd,they opened up the roof above him.after they had broken through,they let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying.when jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic,"child, your sins are forgiven."now some of the scribes were sitting there asking themselves,"why does this man speak that way?  he is blaspheming.who but god alone can forgive sins?"jesus immediately knew in his mindwhat they were thinking to themselves, so he said, "why are you thinking such things in your hearts?which is easier, to say to the paralytic,'your sins are forgiven,'or to say, 'rise, pick up your mat and walk?'but that you may knowthat the son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth"—he said to the paralytic,"i say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go home."he rose, picked up his mat at once,and went away in the sight of everyone.they were all astoundedand glorified god, saying, "we have never seen anything like this."

(7)  i turn to you, lord, in time of trouble,  and you fill me with the joy of salvation.blessed  is he whose fault is taken away,whose  sin is covered.blessed  the man to whom the lord imputes not guilt,in  whose spirit there is no guile.r. i turn to you, lord, in time of trouble,  and you fill me with the joy of salvation.then  i acknowledged my sin to you,my  guilt i covered not.i  said, "i confess my faults to the lord,"and  you took away the guilt of my sin.r. i turn to you, lord, in time of trouble,  and you fill me with the joy of salvation.be  glad in the lord and rejoice, you just;exult,  all you upright of heart.r. i turn  to you, lord, in time of trouble, and you fill me with the joy of salvation. reading ii 1 cor 10:31-11:1  brothers  and sisters,whether  you eat or drink, or whatever you do,do  everything for the glory of god.avoid  giving offense, whether to the jews or greeks orthe  church of god,just  as i try to please everyone in every way,not  seeking my own benefit but that of the many,that  they may be saved.be imitators of me, as i am of christ. gospel mk 1:40-45        a  leper came to jesus and kneeling down begged him and said,"if  you wish, you can make me clean."moved  with pity, he stretched out his hand,touched  him, and said to him,"i  do will it. be made clean."the  leprosy left him immediately, and he was made clean.then,  warning him sternly, he dismissed him at once.he  said to him, "see that you tell no one anything,but  go, show yourself to the priestand  offer for your cleansing what moses prescribed;that  will be proof for them."the  man went away and began to publicize the whole matter.he  spread the report abroadso  that it was impossible for jesus to enter a town openly.he  remained outside in deserted places,and people kept coming to him from everywhere.

reading 1jb 7:1-4, 6-7job spoke, saying:is not man's life on earth a drudgery?are not his days those of hirelings?he is a slave who longs for the shade,a hireling who waits for his wages.so i have been assigned months of misery,and troubled nights have been allotted to me.if in bed i say, "when shall i arise?"then the night drags on;i am filled with restlessness until the dawn.my days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle;they come to an end without hope.remember that my life is like the wind;i shall not see happiness again.responsorial psalmps 147:1-2, 3-4, 5-6 r.

 he went out, not knowing where he was to go.by faith he received power to generate,  even though he was past the normal age  (and sarah herself was sterile  for he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy.so it was that there came forth from one man,  himself as good as dead,  descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky  and as countless as the sands on the seashore.by faith abraham, when put to the test, offered up isaac,  and he who had received the promises was ready to offer      his only son,  of whom it was said,  “through isaac descendants shall bear your name.”he reasoned that god was able to raise even from the dead,  and he received isaac back as a symbol.gospellk 2:22-40 or 2:22, 39-40when the days were completed for their purification  according to the law of moses,  they took him up to jerusalem  to present him to the lord,  just as it is written in the law of the lord,  every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the lord,   and to offer the sacrifice of  a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,   in accordance with the dictate in the law of the lord.now there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon.this man was righteous and devout,  awaiting the consolation of israel,  and the holy spirit was upon him.it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit  that he should not see death  before he had seen the christ of the lord.he came in the spirit into the temple;  and when the parents brought in the child jesus  to perform the custom of the law in regard to him,  he took him into his arms and blessed god, saying:      “now, master, you may let your servant go            in peace, according to your word,      for my eyes have seen your salvation,            which you prepared in sight of all the peoples,      a light for revelation to the gentiles,            and glory for your people israel.”the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him;  and simeon blessed them and said to mary his mother,  “behold, this child is destined  for the fall and rise of many in israel,  and to be a sign that will be contradicted  —and you yourself a sword will pierce—  so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”there was also a prophetess, anna,  the daughter of phanuel, of the tribe of asher.she was advanced in years,  having lived seven years with her husband after her marriage,  and then as a widow until she was eighty-four.she never left the temple,  but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer.and coming forward at that very time,  she gave thanks to god and spoke about the child  to all who were awaiting the redemption of jerusalem.when they had fulfilled all the prescriptions  of the law of the lord,  they returned to galilee,  to their own town of nazareth.the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom;  and the favor of god was upon him.orwhen the days were completed for their purification  according to the law of moses,  they took him up to jerusalem  to present him to the lord.when they had fulfilled all the prescriptions  of the law of the lord,  they returned to galilee,  to their own town of nazareth.the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom;  and the favor of god was upon him.
