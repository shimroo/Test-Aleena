des moines.
only the s’s are silent.
welcome to greater des moines. as the fastest growing metro in the midwest, there’s a buzz that permeates every touch point of iowa’s capital city.  
the sizzle of steak de burgo. selfies snapping at the sculpture park. the roar of the crowd at wells fargo arena. moos and oinks at the state fair. oohs and aahs at the downtown farmers’ market.   
whatever you’re here for, you’ll find something worth shouting about. because in des moines, only the s’s are silent.
