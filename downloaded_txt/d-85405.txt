author's note: i'm a
                pediatrician and the father of avi, 26 years old,
                and nathan, 28 years old. avi has down syndrome ("ds"
                for short) and has inspired me to write these essays
                about children with ds for other parents. i have put
                them here for general reading. you may e-mail me with any questions
                about these essays. i have also included some other
                pediatric items of interest for parents. 
                 
                for students writing reports, i have put together this page on down syndrome
                to help you.

5/19/2020: my apologies,
                but the website was abandoned years ago due to a lack of
                time on my part. i've kept the website up in its
                original style as people keep coming to it for
                information. and yes, my coding skills are stuck from 20
                years ago. but i wanted to make sure the information on
                down syndrome and the new coronavirus were here. the
                link below goes to a specific file on my website and has
                everything we know as of this date. the global down
                syndrome organization will keep an
                  up to date website here on this topic.
