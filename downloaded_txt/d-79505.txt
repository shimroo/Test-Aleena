 view a virtual
        tour of plantation, florida! 
        
location: the
        city of plantation is located in the heart of broward
        county and covers over 21 square miles. plantation is surrounded by fort lauderdale
        to the east, davie to the south and sunrise to the north and west.  plantation is
        known throughout south florida for it's annual art in the park event.


employment:

        express and merrill lynch have called plantation home for many years and we
        continue to attract more businesses every year.
education:
        
the quality of education is a priority to many
        residents in plantation. as a family-friendly city, our educational
        offerings run the gamut from day care centers to both public and private
        elementary, junior and high schools. anyone interested in furthering

        varied and each offers something for everyone. from the large shopping malls such as the
