welcome to valentine public school 

please enjoy this video showcasing our amazing school and the students within.
this video was made for the #lovewhereyoulearn initiative of the department of education, and has since been published on their website. 
thank you to miss maddie baillie, our drama students and of course our school mascot coco for this amazing video.
we hope you enjoying watching it as much as we enjoyed making it.
