ntaba african safaris are:memorable...experience africa’s wildlife, up close and personal. encounter the big 5 – lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos and the cape buffalo – in open land rover vehicles. we use our own reliable, tested network of registered african specialist guides and drivers as well as luxurious hotels and lodges at all our destinations.
unique...we stay familiar with safari lodges, hotels, inter-africa airlines, sightseeing and side tours, post-tour extensions – all aspects of your tour and travel. no other tour company can match ntaba’s knowledge and relationships in southern and eastern africa.
safe...our long-standing and personal relationships with on-site travel operators and community organizations ensure a care-free, hassle-free experience, from guaranteed departures to private lodges to knowledgeable game rangers to sightseeing and side tour operators.
cost-competitive...our local knowledge and long-term relationships with the best providers translate to preferred costs and unique arrangements that make this premier experience an incredible value.
intimate...ntaba african safaris is renowned for its unique, boutique approach. our owners are your guides, sharing their first-hand knowledge of the destinations you visit. call our u.s. offices to talk with robin, stella or another member of our knowledgeable, experienced team.
authentic...we take you beyond the safari on a south african cultural adventure – local food, community life, people, historians, newsmakers – unlike any other safari tour operator can offer.
