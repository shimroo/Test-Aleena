testimonials



                join thousands of satisfied workspace customers










                credit union in amers:





so far, i am pleased with the performance (of workspace). the screens are easier to navigate between and adding favourites is much easier than it was with eikon. great upgrade!








                commercial bank in emea:





the (workspace) user experience is way easier, and the new format makes navigation more straightforward compared to eikon.








                wealth management firm in apac:





sounds like we’re onto a winner. it has also helped that we have had a very smooth transition across from eikon for our team. thanks for all your efforts in making the process so easy.
