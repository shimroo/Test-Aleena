vccer

the virginia center for coal and energy research (vccer or the center) is an interdisciplinary center dedicated to advancing virginia's energy research, addressing environmental concerns, and informing policy. the center was founded through an act of the virginia general assembly on march 30, 1977 and since its establishment, the vccer has supported virginia tech’s mission of instruction, research, and extension through robust coal and energy research initiatives, significant external funding, and critical support for faculty and graduate students across multiple departments. the center remains active in these areas and has a strong funding profile that enables high-quality research, scholarship, and outreach.








the virginia center for coal and energy research was created by an act of the virginia general assembly on march 30, 1977, as an interdisciplinary study, research, information, and resource facility for the commonwealth of virginia. in july of that year, a directive approved by the virginia tech board of visitors placed the vccer under the university provost because of its intercollegiate character, and, because the center's mandate encompasses the three missions of the university: instruction, research, and extension.




















the vccer’s core mission focuses on:

research: addressing interdisciplinary energy and coal-related issues relevant to virginia.
coordination: serving as a nexus for coal and energy research at virginia tech and across the commonwealth.
information dissemination: ensuring research insights reach industry, government, and public stakeholders.
socio-economic and environmental analysis: examining the socio-economic and environmental impacts of energy development.
policy support: aiding in the commonwealth’s energy planning and implementation.







as part of its research mission, the center leverages its resources to support the university’s faculty and students while advancing scholarship within its thematic focus areas.
