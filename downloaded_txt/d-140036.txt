 **on october 31st, 2023, the nuyorican poets cafe celebrated its 50th anniversary and closed its doors to begin off-site programming.**

  then, on november 1st, 2023, we closed our iconic doors for a $24 million, 3-year building renovation project -- called the "nuyoricanstruction" phase -- ushering us into the next 50 years. our open mics, poetry slams, grand slams, music programs and educational programs are now taking place in various venues around the lower east side and nyc in-person as well as online via the internet. check out our full events calendar for information and tickets.


help us keep poetry, jazz, hip-hop, and theater alive on the lower east side
