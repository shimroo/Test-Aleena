this page updated 1/20/25

	i've moved suzann.com here, so that's why this site looks a little 
	different. i'm hosting it now on blogger, which i'm not as familiar with. it'll take me a while to get it 
	looking the way i want and transferring everything over.
thank you for your patience! you can 
	still see the old content here at the wayback machine.
