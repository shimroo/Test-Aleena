camp blue ridge was my home away from home when i was younger and now is my daughters. the warmth and spirit there is the best. it is definitely one big happy family at camp filled with lots of love and amazing activities in a safe environment. i know that my daughter is safe and having a blast and at the same time, learning to be more independent – a win all around! blue ridge is amazing


- amy greenberg









my daughters had the best summer of their lives. they never expressed an interest in going to sleep away camp until this summer. i’m so glad that camp blue ridge came into our lives! they treat everyone like they are a part of the family. they were so accommodating to both of my daughter’s individual needs! my daughters made life long friends at camp. when my girls hot home i asked my younger daughter if she was happy to be home or would she rather be at camp? without hesitation she said camp!


- paula zeeman









camp blue ridge has truly become a second home for my 2 children. they wait 10 months of the year just to go back again. they are all smiles for the entire time they are there. the entire camp is like a family, which i so appreciate. the camp gives them a variety of activities to choose from and to explore so that each camper can experience their own version of camp. i cannot be more thankful to blue ridge for taking care of my kids and making sure they are safe while having the summer of their dreams.
