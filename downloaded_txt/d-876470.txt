bhaavik deshmukh - network administrator
we were always searching for a single company that could handle everything, and with escan, we discovered it: powerful security protection, simple maintenance, and user-friendly setup, all with a low total cost of ownership.



atharva - central services delivery manager
weâve been working diligently to build our expertise in the security area, with escan as our vendor of choice we had escan endpoint installations. itâs been about three years since we made a decision to go full steam ahead with escan two-factor authentication and other complementary escan solutions.



izaan - it manager
we are confident in escan's excellent assistance, and the fact that we can implement a complete, single-vendor solution that is simple to maintain from a single console allows us to improve the security of our environment at a lesser cost.

this is my second time of using escan antivirus. i like it because it takes very less resources. other anti-virus remove viruses and damage or remove your data. escan does not harm your data. it is very safe and secure. i like it very much and recommend my friends to use escan anti-virus or escan internet security suite.
