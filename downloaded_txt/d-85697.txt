gnu is the only operating system developed
specifically to give its users freedom.  what is gnu, and what freedom
is at stake?


















escape to freedom: a video from the fsf
what is gnu?
gnu is an operating system that
is free software—that is,
it respects users' freedom.  the gnu operating system consists of gnu
packages (programs specifically released by the gnu project) as well
as free software released by third parties.  the development of gnu
made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample
your freedom.
we recommend installable
versions of gnu (more precisely, gnu/linux distributions) which
are entirely free software.  more about gnu
below.

what is the free software movement?
the free software movement campaigns to win for the users of
computing the freedom that comes from free software.  free software
puts its users in control of their own computing.  nonfree software
puts its users under the power of the software's developer.  see

the video explanation.
what is free software?
free software means the users have the freedom to run,
copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
free software is a matter of liberty, not price.  to understand the
concept, you should think of “free” as in “free
speech,” not as in “free beer.”
more precisely, free software means users of a program have
the four essential
freedoms:

the freedom to run the program as you wish,
    for any purpose (freedom 0).
the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it
    does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). access to the source
    code is a precondition for this.
the freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others
    (freedom 2).
the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions
    to others (freedom 3).  by doing this you can give the whole
    community a chance to benefit from your changes.
    access to the source code is a precondition for this.

developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms
even more
important now than they were in 1983.
nowadays the free software movement goes far beyond developing the
gnu system.  see the free software
foundation's web site for more about what we do, and a list
of ways you can help.
more about gnu
gnu is a unix-like operating system.  that
means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries,
developer tools, even games.  the development of gnu, started in
january 1984, is known as the gnu project.  many of the programs in
gnu are released under the auspices of the gnu project; those we
call gnu packages.
the name “gnu” is a recursive acronym for “gnu's
not
unix.” “gnu”
is pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying
“grew” but replacing the r with n.
the program in a unix-like system that allocates machine resources
and talks to the hardware is called the “kernel.”  gnu is
typically used with a kernel called linux.  this combination is
the gnu/linux operating
system.  gnu/linux is used by millions, though
many call it “linux” by
mistake.
gnu's own kernel, the gnu hurd,
was started in 1990 (before linux was started).  volunteers continue
developing the hurd because it is an interesting technical
project.

the gnu project strongly urges the community to communicate in 
ways that are friendly, welcoming and kind. see the 

gnu kind communications guidelines.



as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be
glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we
should do freely and generously. —benjamin

nano-archimedes
nano-archimedes is a free package for the simulation of quantum systems.
it is based on the wigner equation, a formulation of quantum mechanics
in terms of a phase-space which is mathematically equivalent to the
schroedinger equation.  nano-archimedes implements the wigner monte
carlo method.  the code can be easily extended to density functional
theory (dft) and time-dependent ab-initio simulations.
