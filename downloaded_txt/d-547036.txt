bob's 
journey
into freedom

i want to share with you insights, tools, tips, resources, and a
process that have completely transformed my life. wow! i have been in my own
personal hell, and have come out into a place of peace, joy, and personal
freedom. i have seen these ideas work for thousands of people that i've worked
with.                             

    
                                                                                                               



in the 8th grade my lifestyle habits were completely off track. i was 
depressed, emotionally shut down, and had very low self esteem. my eating and 
lifestyle habits kept me in the same place for years until i was 21 years old.
my life was dramatically out of
balance. i felt out of control. i believed, at a very deep level, that i
couldnt stop overeating. i hated myself. my eating habits and my lifestyle kept
me fat and very unhappy and emotionally withdrawn. 

to change, i needed to learn why i made the choices i did, and learn new 
lifestyle skills to do it differently. i've now kept making these new 
choices for 45 years.





here's me. i'm hiking in goat rocks wilderness. i 
could never have done this unless i'd changed my lifestyle habits. the quality 
of my life has dramatically improved because of my learning the 12 essential 
skills that are shared in my playbook. at 65 years old i still go back packing 
with about a 35-pound pack on my back!  check out my frolic 
in nature page for beautiful pictures of lovely spots.
learn how you 
too can be healthy for life!




bob's birthday picture at 63 years old! 
.
i started my
journey of lifestyle change at 21 years of age. i then switched to other addictions because of
the stresses and unhealthy influences in my life. i explored numerous emotional, mental,
spiritual, and physical areas

to help me get to the root causes of my life imbalance.
these helped me transform the patterns that led me to to be so unhealthy and to 
my use of alcohol and drugs. i've now have been drug and alcohol-free for over 
30 years.

pay
a visit to bob's story (and
the expanded version) for ideas of how i changed my life and how these ideas can
help you transform the causes of your being out of balance into lifetime well-being. 
i encourage you to
check out the rest of  this site. i share tons of  fun ideas.
happy exploring. may your life blossom into friskiness!  

☺hugs, bob
