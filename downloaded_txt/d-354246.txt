why choose business phone systems?
when you first start your business or run a one person operation, a single line telephone or cell phone will provide communications between you and your customers. as your company grows the need for better communication between you and your customers increases.  the number of people you can communicate with is determined by the number of voice paths that exist on your telephone system. a phone system provided by a traditional telephone company is one line at a time. once you get more than one line from a traditional telephone company they provide a service that connects these lines together. this is normally called a multi-line hunt. this allows for a single phone number to ring a single line in your multi line phone system. there may be two or more lines in each hunt group. the biggest problem with this arrangement is the cost, every time you add another line your costs go up (i.e. $100 for one line, $200 for two lines, $300 for three lines).
companies that want to save on their business phone system costs will choose a low number of lines to keep the costs as low as possible. when you don't have enough lines to handle the number of calls coming in and out of your business, the calls get blocked and do not reach the people that need to reach your business.  awesome telenet provides a system that includes a minimum of five lines to your business, without blocking any calls. this system does not cost more for every line you use, and can significantly reduce your monthly business telephone bill. many of the other features that a multi line hunt system provides are extra charges from the telephone company. these features are included in your awesome telemet service. some features we offer are not available from the other telephone companies including voicemail and off-site notification of calls.

business phone numbers
phone numbers are one of a business's biggest assets. ownership of phone numbers in the united states belongs to the phone user not the phone company. when you have a phone number it can be moved âportedâ between any telephone service provider. the phone numbers may be ported between wireline and wireless phone systems. porting ensures that you keep the same phone number regardless of your choice of telephone provider. many companies will hide the fact that you can move your phone number to another service, to keep your current number. awesome telenet will port your phone number to their system free of charge.

telephone answering service
many companies employ telephone answering services to provide 24-hour access for their customerâs telephone. answering services are an extra expense and usually require someone from the company to initiate call forwarding to an answering service number before they leave the office. awesome telenet provides scheduling so the phones automatically are forwarded to another number which could be a telephone answering service, a cell phone, or a voicemail. awesome telenet's voicemail service includes email notification, so your company is alerted immediately and a message is left on the voicemail. this voicemail service can be much better than a telephone answering service because the entire message is sent as an audio attachment to your email. the audio file may be heard from a computer or cell phone. the voicemail service can provide 24-hour access for your customers without additional charges.

telephone hardware
all telephone hardware and telephone service is provided by awesome telenet. you will not receive another bill from another company for your telephone service. awesome telenet provides telephone hardware with no long-term financing or a huge upfront cost. awesome telenet maintains the telephone equipment at your business for no extra cost. this equipment is the latest cisco hardware.

what is included in my bill when choosing awesome telenet?
