do you have any questions about the w720 kayak-skiff?









unrivaled stability and comfort, no back pain or leg numbness
enjoy the natural, ergonomic and super-stable riding position. wavewalk microskiffs and kayaks feature a saddle seat that’s similar to the saddle of a personal watercraft (pwc) a.k.a. jet ski. when your legs straddle the high saddle seat, they support your balancing, control, paddling and fishing efforts, and you can switch anytime between several natural ergonomic positions.
roomiest for passengers, and largest onboard storage
wavewalk’s kayaks and cartop microskiffs are the world’s roomiest, and offer unmatched onboard storage
the s4 cockpit’s is 7’11” long (95″), offering enough room for three adult passengers and their gear. additional storage is available below the casting deck at the bow, and in the rear hull tips. click image to enlarge.
4 boaters with their s4 microskiff
wavewalk’s unique high saddle seat provides comfort for everyone, including toddlers, adults, big and heavy people, people with back problems and disabilities, and elderly people. anyone can stand up in full confidence in a wavewalk.
