we love the church
there are three words that encapsulate who we are at raintree: "come, connect, and contribute." the word "come" describes how we purposefully gather each week to worship christ together as a church. the word "connect" portrays how we intentionally grow in christ together as a church. the word "contribute" displays how we actively serve christ together as a church. as we follow christ, our chief shepherd, we seek to be gospel-driven, word-centered, and christ-exalting in our focus, worship, and community. sound gospel doctrine will produce a vibrant gospel culture that is centered on christ and focused on life-on-life discipleship.
