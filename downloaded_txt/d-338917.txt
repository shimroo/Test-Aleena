steve maltz - author, writer, and content creator.















in a nutshell:i am a british author of 39 books, dedicated to making complex topics accessible and engaging. my writings explore the bible, the church, israel, hebraic thinking and mindset, identity, society, woke culture, and the israel-palestine conflict. with a blend of insight, clarity, and humour, i provide fresh perspectives on faith, history, and modern issues.my background & journeyborn into a non-practicing jewish family, i am a believer in jesus with a passion for reconnecting the church to its hebraic roots. my professional career spans web consulting, systems analysis, project management, tour guiding, and software, website, and game design.i co-founded saltshakers, a vibrant faith-based community, and initiated the foundations conferences, which explore the hebraic heritage of christianity. through these efforts, i’ve helped believers rediscover the rich cultural and spiritual foundations of their faith.my mission: restoring the church’s hebraic rootsfor years, i have been dedicated to reintroducing the church to its hebraic foundations, addressing historical neglect and misconceptions. many fear that embracing hebrew roots leads to legalism, but my mission is to highlight the freedom found in the teachings of jesus and the early church.by integrating a biblical, hebraic perspective, i seek to empower believers to walk in faith with joy, truth, and a deeper understanding of their spiritual heritage. my goal is to restore the church’s original foundation while honouring gentile contributions and avoiding doctrinal rigidity.






















what is hebraic church?the hebraic church is not about adopting jewish customs but about embracing a biblical mindset—one rooted in early christian faith. it encourages wisdom, inquiry, and authentic faith. by understanding the bible through its original context, believers can experience a fuller, richer walk with god.
