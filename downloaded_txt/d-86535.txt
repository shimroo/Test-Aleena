as a pioneer of responsible healthcare delivery, unite for sight serves, empowers, and mentors organizations and individuals to provide high-quality outcomes.




















































global impact corpstraining current and future leaders in global health, the global impact corps is an immersive global health opportunity for students and professionals. global impact fellows support and learn from local doctors as they provide care to patients living in poverty in villages, slums, and refugee camps. fellows learn from the local medical professionals about social entrepreneurship, patient barriers to care, and about effective strategies to reach the hardest-to-reach patients who are otherwise unable to access or afford care.
