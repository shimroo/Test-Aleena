  thyroid discussion group  
 
 if you have a thyroid condition, here is a free mailing list for you! 

  

welcome to the thyroid discussion group!

  

 thyroid on listserv@listserv.icors.org 


the thyroid discussion group talks about all aspects of thyroid
conditions and diseases - how they influence our health and
lifestyles, treatments for thyroid conditions from the consumer
perspective, thyroid self-care, support systems,
and basic facts about these topics.
topics also include related conditions and complications
such as basedow's disease, flajani's disease, goiter, grave's
disease, hashimoto's disease, hypothyroid, hyperthyroid,
myxedema, parry's disease, struma, thyroiditis, thyroid
nodules, wilson's syndrome, etc.  these associated topics are
fair game, especially as they relate to people dealing with
thyroid conditions in their everyday lives.  families and
friends are also welcome!
