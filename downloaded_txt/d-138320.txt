photo: ben wilson (left) was tragically shot in chicago near simeon high school on november, 20, 1984 and was pulled off life support the next morning. he was considered the best player in the 1985 class. derrick rose, a member of the famed 2007 class, honored wilson by wearing no. 25 at simeon and he joins wilson on the list of the hoop scoop’s ranking of the top 100 high school players since 1984.

by van coleman, special to the hoop scoop
one of my best friends in basketball, as well as life, recently passed away. that friend was brick oettinger, one of america’s greatest high school talent evaluators and more importantly, one of the best human beings to ever grace the game of basketball, period.
most fans of the game may remember brick from his columns in the “the poop sheet, acc sports journal, and prep stars magazine”, enjoying his amazingly thorough and accurate player profiles, but not realizing that basketball wasn’t his primary vocation. it was a vocation for his love of the game. brick’s main vocation over most of the thirty plus years that i knew him was as a “unc correctional education director in the division of continuing education” which he developed and held from 1974 until his retirement in 2014.

all 50 ranked teams written up with explanations for why they were placed in these positions with comparisons to preseason ranking. the fab 50 national team rankings powered by ballislife.com is the official rankings of the national sports news service, which date back to the 1952 season. montverde academy of florida is the 2023-24 mythical national champion, as the program captured its seventh fab 50 title since 2013, tying oak hill academy of virginia for most all-time no. 1 finishes.
