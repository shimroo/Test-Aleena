eucharistic
we carry out the church's vocation of praise, thanksgiving and love. in eucharistic adoration, we find the most effective means of growing in holiness and of contributing to the salvation of the world.











contemplative
we support and make fruitful the apostolic activity of the whole church by our life of prayer, especially celebration of the liturgy and daily self-offering.











franciscan
we walk joyfully the footsteps of the poor and humble jesus in the spirit of holy simplicity, humility and poverty as taught by st. francis and st. clare.
