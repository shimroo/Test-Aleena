got a couple pounds of freshops delivered yesterday. food for my hop rocket! time to brew, thanks y'all!


happy new year!!! — providence village, texas.

john bostonas a 13 year home brew veteran, and former president of the fellowship of oklahoma ale makers, i must say your hops were the freshest and highest quality i have ever seen or smelled. i have been a northern brewer fan since visiting the anchor brewery in 1987, but i have never come across any northern brewer hops that rivaled those anchor uses... until this batch arrived. the 4 oz of cascade that came as part of your value pack were also a delight to behold.
serious eats article on homebrewing“fresh hops come around once a year in the fall. in the united states, most of the fresh hops you can get will come from oregon or washington (unless you grow them yourself.) one good source is freshops,”
portland beer org“freshops.com, a great place to buy and learn about hops.   there, you can read about hop varieties, look up current alpha acid percentages, and click a button to have hops delivered to your home.”
wallywarped04dave at freshops is a… super nice guy, and he runs a clean ship. i shop there.
sherry levequei received your root stock in record time and excellent condition. i am impressed.
lily jen, jacksonville ori ordered 5 different hop rhizomes from freshops. every one of them was very large and in great shape! fast shipping, great prices, nice website. i will order from them again.
carrie hafele, akgrows in alaska

i was half expecting this hop not to grow in ak, but some of its shoots are already three inches tall! i definitely recommend them and would get more if i had more places to plant them!


donald mowersdave's selection of hops is very good and his knowledge is great.
stevie, txfreshops is a great source. i get an order or two from them every year. ...their hops are incredible. the best mt. hood i have ever used has been from them. i really use that one a lot, and damn, it is tasty. i do like the clarity of wort produced when filtering through a bed of cones.
joe harrisi called you on a friday and ordered 8 rhizomes. the following monday, i received the order in the mail. you must have processed my order immediately for it to arrive that quickly, thanks! special thanks to you for tremendous service, great products at great prices.
james deatherageknowledgeable and helpful staff, always friendly and helpful.  5 stars on google!
mitch k.i have worked at two of the three largest nurseries in america, but i can’t recall anything that has a more vigorous growth rate than these hops.
i just wanted to say thanks for the fast service and viable rhizomes. you are a great company!

atrill, chicago ilmy order for hop rhizomes arrived in less than a week - and they were in great shape when they arrived. i've had bad luck ordering hop rhizomes from others in the past, but i will order from them [freshops] again.
joshua kingsuper friendly and helpful staff! my order was processed and shipped graciously fast.
barley69i love freshops! they have a much better selection of american-style hops like simcoe-amarillo-etc.
curtis halei am writing to thank you for an excellent transaction.

jonathan, the beer mapping projectas far as i can tell, this is also where many other homebrew shops also get their hop rhizomes from. prices on rhizomes are a bit cheaper if you order directly from freshops, so check their website in early spring to see which kind of hops and hop rhizomes they have for sale. also, don't forget to check out their website for one-of-a-kind instructions on raising hops and tons of other articles about hops.
sa chrisyou guys rock! the rhizomes i ordered are kicking butt in southern new jersey!
corey patricki had nothing short of an excellent experience with dave and his company, i would not hesitate to take my business back to him again. i made an error and told him there were some missing rhizomes, but upon further inspection, they were actually in the shipment. i quickly told him they were there, and he sent me more out of good will! i got a 100% growth rate on his rhizomes, and they're extremely healthy.
robertjust from the feel, and smell, of these hops, i can say that (greg noonan’s recommendation) was right on the money… thanks for a great product!
the press democrat, ca“there are many good websites for in-depth information, and one site in particular is freshops.com from oregon. it covers a wide range of information on growing hops.”
david r. waitei wanted to tell you how extremely pleased i am with the quality of these hops! i have never purchased whole hops that look and smell this wonderful.
thanks for quick turnaround on the order, and for making hops of this quality and value available to fellow homebrewers.
aeneas via brewboardi like freshops, personally. they allow me to order in smaller increments and have a better selection.
nancy scotteveryone who saw my garden wanted to know what that gorgeous plant was! next year they will be covering a 20′ x 20′ purgola. thanks again!
rick ofteljust wanted to thank you again for the extremely fresh and prompt shipment of my last order.
just last evening, i brewed up a german style lager using the n.z. hallertauer and magnum whole hops.
looking forward to many future purchases and just wanted to thank you for your attention to detail and also for allowing me the chance to make such great beer!
