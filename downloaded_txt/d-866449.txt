literacy is not a luxury.
understanding the written word is imperative for children and the adults they will become to fully participate in society. where and when does literacy begin? at home, in schools, and with loving adults.
we are committed to building joyful reading habits and practices for young children by providing them with books and programs to support their learning, literacy, and creativity. we focus our work on children from marginalized communities and children of color to bolster early reading efforts for those furthest from educational justice and equity.
