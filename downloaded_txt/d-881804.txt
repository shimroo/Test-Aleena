proposed zoning change



 
use matrix table side-by-side comparison
 
over the past two years, the city of greenville has been working toward an update of its zoning code to reflect the types of developments that are common for our city and a more rural central illinois location.  the proposed new zoning code will be easier to navigate and follows the same format of zoning codes for other municipalities of greenville’s size.  
 
the proposed changes to the zoning code are similar to surrounding counties and are formatted in a style which developers in our area are accustomed to seeing.  the new code has zoning districts similar to those the city previously had but now carry new names and descriptions.  the most notable change in the proposed new zoning does not allow for multifamily housing in areas designated for single family housing.  
 
click the link below to view the proposed zoning code. this is a draft version and is subject to change or revision.
 
draft city of greenville zoning code
 
letters of notification were recently mailed to property owners whose zones will be impacted by the changes.  additionally, 4’x8’ signs will be placed throughout the city displaying the old zoning map in comparison to the new zoning map with notification of the public hearing.  a public hearing to discuss the proposal is scheduled as part of the  planning commission meeting on february 24, 2025 at 6 p.m. at the greenville municipal building (city hall) at 404 s. third street.
 
for easier review, our gis director has created a link where you can type in your address to view the old zoning versus the proposed new zoning.

 
we welcome any questions; please direct them to jeff ketten at 618-664-1644 x 1008 or jketten@greenvilleillinois.com.
