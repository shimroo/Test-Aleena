hosted by: david robison, president, design master software
                wednesday, february 12, 2025, 1pm eastern / 10am pacific


                learn the best practices leading electrical engineering
                companies are using to create their single-line diagrams in
                revit. top firms were able to cut their design time in half
                with these techniques!
              

1. eliminate duplication errors

                learn how top companies are synchronizing their design so that
                all their sheets are always using the same information.
                
                â
2. respond faster to project changes

                learn how to speed up your design process so you can respond
                to the architect's changes in minutes and not days.
                
                â
3. maintain a consistent drawing appearance

                learn how to keep your single-line diagrams consistent across
                people and projects so your drawings are uniform and distinct.
