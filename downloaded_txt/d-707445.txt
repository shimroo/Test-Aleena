our clients

						"what a relief to have come across spire hosting. for the last 20 years a one person organisation has dealt with all things digital for my little business. ill health meant my present provider needed to ask me to find an alternative organisation. in the space of a week, i've gone from desperation to elation. thank you spire hosting and dan smith in particular."					





edwardvia trustpilot 






						"i have just moved my hosting over to spire from one of the big american players and my first impressions have been fantastic. the support help and guidance i have had from dan has been way beyond anything i would of expected at ten times the price. apart from our website now running much faster than it did on my previous hosting i would and will recommend spire based solely on there incredible customer support, make the switch you wont regret it. dean"					





deanvia trustpilot 






						"spire hosting is a great company - run by dan and a small team that work alongside him, dan is contactable, approachable and committed to his customers. spire hosting has demonstrated to me that they are a forward thinking company that take the needs of their customers and customer care seriously. hosting is reliable and fast, and, if there is an occasional issue, this is generally dealt with **very** quickly."					





benvia trustpilot 






						"dan helped us not only find a solution for all of our needs but walked us through it step by step and put in the extra effort to make sure we found the perfect hosting solution without paying for something we didnt need. would highly recommend speaking to dan about any hosting queries you may have.

the whole transition from start to finish was effortless."
