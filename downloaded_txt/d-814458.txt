history



 

the resort is named after martin quinn, an irish immigrant and miner. during mining transports along the river in the early 1880's, he noticed bands of native americans gathering near a steamy mountainside outcrop.  upon further exploration, he staked his claim and built the residence, bathhouses and sleeping accommodations that laid foundation for the resort we enjoy today.
