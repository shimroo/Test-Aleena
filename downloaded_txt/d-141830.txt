biologic software specializes in the creation of
						software for the simulation and analysis of molecular interactions
						as recorded by spr biosensors.
our latest product is scrubber, a program to
						clean up biosensor data for analysis. it can zero and crop data,
						align injection times, correct for dmso effects and fit binding
						curves and offrates. 

						the new version of scrubber extends the functions
						of the program with the ability to analyse the kinetics of binding
						to obtain rate constants.you can choose to fit a model for simple
						binding to get values the association and dissociation rates or fit
						a model for mass transport limited binding to also get the mass
						transport rate. see the scrubber page for more
						information.
