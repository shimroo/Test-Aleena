enlightenment and wisdomzen & photography/deep thoughts"talking about zen all the time is like looking for fish tracks in a dry riverbed."--wu tzu "vision is the art of 
seeing the invisible."--jonathon swiftphotographs with itdocumentaries/postcards/zineswe know there is something special about great photographs, something that defies description in words, that can only be seen and felt. henri cartier-bresson defined it as 'the decisive moment.' robert leverant's zen interpretation named it, simply, 'it.'   whatever the magic is called, these pictures have it."the quieter you become, the more you can hear."  --baba ram dassone more thought:"i have always been a great believer in today. most people live either in the past or in the future, so that they really never live at all...utopia is in the moment.  not in some future time, some other place, but in the here and now, or else it is nowhere."  --alfred steiglitz, 1937
