tiffany, handel, bradley & hubbard lamp repair historical building lighting restoration church lighting restorationantique heirloom lamp restorationstained glass lamp repairlamp base and rewiring repair       i will bring to your lamp project over 40 years experience, knowledge and resources.  working for churches, architectural lighting companies, historical building groups and antique lighting dealers…     my tiffany lamp repair studio is in tiverton rhode island just north of newport. it is a great area full of artists, craftsman, vineyards, farmland and antique shops. my lamp repair studio stocks over 600 colors of glass, with some of the rarest textures and styles made over 100 years ago.   colors used by bradley hubbard lamp, tiffany lamp, miller lamp, handel and other lamp lighting companies from the early 1900’s.     ownership of an antique bent slag glass or stained glass lamp sometimes carries a lot of pride and responsibility over the years.  a client will often express in-depth knowledge about their lamp when it arrives for restoration. some will show me black and white pictures from a photo album with their antique slag glass lamp in the background.  when clients describe their lamp they start by saying “this tiffany lamp has been in my family for many years”.  please review my testimonial page and see how my skills and craftsmanship have helped many owners of antique lighting over the past 40 years.   my portfolio is broad from a lighting fixtures in korea, england, canada, netherlands and belgium.   to  churches and the christian science center in boston.  to be less intimidating you can browse and enjoy some of my local bent slag glass lamp repairs below.

metal >
      are you looking for lost or missing white metal parts for your slag glass or reverse painted panel lamp?  has your base or shade metal been compromised with poor past repairs?      finding the right person with the skill set and knowledge to restore this type of metal is difficult.  there are many people that will say they can do the work or will attempt to fix white metal.  i believe most shops can perform minor repairs like adding a new tab or soldering an old tab back on.  but beyond that advanced skills are required.  many antique dealer trust and use my skills and experience  to restore their metal frames, chandelier arms and bases.  click for more  metal work →
painting >
before i offer the option of painting a metal lamp shade or base i need to know the conditions and express my approach to each project.basically the process i use is a cold form of painting which was performed by many manufactures during the turn of the century.  not to be confused with metal plating.  i first evaluate the metal by removing and testing a sample spot of the original paint. after testing depending on the type of metal i may sandblast, grind or wire brush prepping the metal before painting.   a typical air brush approach is 1 coat primer, 2 base coats and 1 coat clear sealer.  an optional 1 coat 5-10% decorative can be applied.

bent slag glass lamp panel repairs  











     to these surviving antique bent glass panel lamps i say “happy birthday”.  most are over 110 years old and i’ve enjoyed giving them another100 more years.  as a lighting restoration craftsman.  i’m focused on the preservation of these american made lighting fixtures.  they have survived wars, scrap yards, depressions, and a pandemic.  the memories and legacy of the past owners are being restored as well.     my goal is to help you with my knowledge and expert skills get the work completed.  when a lamp arrives with poor past glass repairs, no wiring or missing glass.  i can often correct the situation.  the results are impressive.
