i have been hunting with action adventures since 2013, 3 private land hunts with jay and one pack in hunt with his son justin.  in 2012 i decided to finally pursue my dream of elk hunting; it was a little overwhelming with all the outfitters out there. by a chance encounter i met someone who had hunted with action adventures and even though he had not harvested an elk he had nothing but great things to say about jay, his hard work and his honesty.  me and two of my friends booked our first hunt in 2013, after hunting that season i see why the gentleman i had met had nothing but good things to say. jay is one of the most honest hard working guys i’ve had the honor of meeting. me and one of my friends ended up harvesting a cow elk the first year, i was hooked!!!
