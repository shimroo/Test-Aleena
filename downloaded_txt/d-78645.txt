a perfect fit of durability, acoustics, and unique visuals
from a natural factory finish or white, to made-to-order sherwin-williams® colors, tectum panels can coordinate or complement your color palette with the sizes, shapes, and forms that make your designs happen.
toughness and acoustics are at the heart of  tectum interior products, ideally suited to open spaces and high traffic, high impact areas. panels can be attached directly to walls and ceilings, clouds deliver design flexibility and acoustic performance in a floating system, and linear baffles provide even more design options.
create a signature element in a space to complement your interior design. the possibilities are endless, the look is one-of-a-kind, and the acoustic properties of tectum panels can help quiet the space.
