our vision

druze identity is defined by family values and traditions that engulf and reflect the teachings of the tawheed faith. as a druze organization in the united states, the ads is bringing its druze members together to share and preserve their faith, values, heritage, and culture. the principles of the tawheed druze faith are based on the oneness of god and from this base come the seven tenets that every druze is obligated to honor. core principles of our faith, especially truthfulness, safeguarding of our brethren, and the belief in one god make us all brothers and sisters in faith. that creates a strong, and solid sense of unity and belonging for our members.
it is the druze common goal to be united wherever we are regardless of borders, or national origin.
