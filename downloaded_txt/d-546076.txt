packing for ack - day





i'll be heading to nantucket (one of my favorite places to visit) in a few weeks. it's still kind of chilly there during the spring. this is a sample of what items i might bring with me for daytime. stay tuned for an evening outfit. it's a pretty casual place! (not quite as cas as when i started to go 20 years ago, but still pretty laid back)!ack day by julieatshelter featuring a stripe shirtorganic by john patrick stripe shirt$255 - lagarconne.comj crew puff vest$110 - jcrew.com7 for all mankind skinny fit jeans€259 - veryeickhoff.combalenciaga flat shoes$945 - balenciaga.com3 1 phillip lim foldover tote$750 - lagarconne.comalexander mcqueen antique gold jewelry$495 - forwardforward.comchanel chunky bangle£485 - farfetch.comstella dot pave jewelry$34 - stelladot.comkate spade jewelry$58 - endless.comjennifer zeuner peace jewelry$308 - jenniferzeuner.commango aviator shades£18 - houseoffraser.co.ukprinted iphone 4 case$25 - jcrew.com
