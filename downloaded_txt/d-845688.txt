new music:the man in me
                        
in the words of the great eta james, âat last!â this has been a monster project to create-sifting through all of my unreleased recordings to choose what i wanted to present to you, would be a tough task for someone sighted. itâs made even more difficult for me as my âfiling systemâ is to listen and listen and listen again. and then i started writing again a few months ago and decided to record three new songs to include. i think it will be worth the wait!
some of these recordings were master demos and some were live performances. all have been re-mastered by chris greenwell at louisvilleâs own downtown recording studio to give you the best quality listening experience.                  
these songs cover 50 years of my career from 1970 to 2020. the people who contributed to this anthology are numerous and cross the country. some are still with us, many have sadly passed, but they all touched my life in profound ways. for a complete listing, please refer to the acknowledgements on this site.                  
thank you so much for listening, and blessings to you all!
