what you need to know about bird flu  or avian influenza

				    bird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai), is caused by the h5n1 virus, which has infected wild birds for decades. in march 2024, the first h5n1 influenza outbreak in dairy cows was detected in the u.s. since then, h5n1 infection in dairy cows has become widespread and over 900 dairy herds in 16 states are affected.                     outbreaks in commercial poultry have been detected in 50 states. h5n1 infection of backyard flocks has also been reported. 
				    as of january 14, 2025, h5n1 infection was detected in snow geese in delaware, a commercial poultry farm in caroline county, maryland, and a commercial poultry farm in queen anne’s county, maryland.                     
				    people and pets can become infected when they are directly exposed to infected animals. human infections with the h5n1 virus can happen when virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. currently, there are 67 confirmed reported human cases of h5n1 avian influenza in the u.s. most of the affected individuals had mild disease. however, one person had severe disease that required intensive care hospitalization, and unfortunately, this individual passed away. > read the entire article
