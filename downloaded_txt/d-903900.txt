meet the perry's!the simple dream of having a family-owned business sparked this now popular enterprise jewelry store known for its fine jewelry and engagement rings. entrepreneur alan perry moved to charlotte with two of his brothers for the chance to open his own jewelry store. the charlotte jewelry store location was the first perry’s jewelry store. alan’s brother, ernie, remained the charlotte, nc location's owner and operator for years.after a successful decade of partnership, alan perry began looking for a new business venture. he moved closer to the ocean to open his own “perry’s emporium.” the independence mall in wilmington, nc, became home to the new jewelry store branch in 1991. in 2000, alan moved into the beautiful barclay commons location, where the wilmington location of perry’s emporium still sits today!since then, alan's sons, josh and jordan have joined their father in the family business and perry's emporium has also been blessed with the opportunity to open additional locations in shallotte and hampstead! perry's has expanded to become one of the largest jewelry stores in north carolina. it has also become a favorite place for couples to find the perfect wedding jewelry, such as engagement rings, wedding rings, and wedding bands. residents of southeastern north carolina trust perry's emporium for jewelry repair and appraisal, watch repair, custom jewelry, and all their jewelry buying needs!
