colorado county is not currently under a burn ban. colorado county emergency management requests that prior to starting any controlled burning (woodpiles, fields or large refuse piles), please call the colorado county communications center at 979-732-2388, option 2.  they will ask you for the location and a contact number.  by doing this you will help prevent the needless dispatching of volunteer fire departments and will also receive information if a burn ban or red flag warning is in place.
