american blues network is available for block formats via internet server.  radio stations across the country are adapting this particular format to attract mature numbers without sounding boring or overly ballad-driven. frankly, your 35 and older demographic likes to have fun too!  along with an increasingly popular format, you will also have energetic live personalities that have influence in the genre and have history in it.
 
why it works
 
american blues network is successful because blues crosses demographics regardless of age, race or social class. this format brings in new listeners while keeping your core audience listening. does the format you use have the flexibility and potential to bring in and appeal to
all the people in your market?
 
party blues and oldies does!
 
american blues network grounds itself to hits from 1985 through today.  it showcases blues superstars such as b.b. king, bobby rush, tyrone davis, denise lasalle, big pokey, sir charles jones, j. wonn, johnny taylor, and millie jackson to name a few.
 
the economic impact
 
american blues network can not only generate revenue but it can save operating expenses.  this format targets your listening audience which has a growing fan base in this genre of music.  it offsets the overhead expense because it is completely automated; we do all the work, you sit back and gain the market share.
 
technical requirements
 
american blues network is 24-hr programming fed on an internet-based delivery system.  we recommend the use of a barix annuncicom 1000 for optimum programming. it has balanced audio and supervised i/o.  it is ideal to serve as a gateway between ip paging, voip, and intercom systems.  any type of basic high speed internet (cable modem, dsl, "u-verse", etc.) can be used for this system but they must be reliable.  satellite internet (sky-blue, hughes-net, etc.) has not been tested but might also work.
 
note:  additional monthly "data plan" bandwidth limitations, usage fees, overage fees, and bad weather interruptions may apply if you have a satellite internet service provider!
