adieu dear blog

well, it seems that ravelry has totally taken over my knitting/internet needs.  this blog was a great way to catalog prior projects and track progress, and generally connect and chat with the knitting community.  with those needs met elsewhere, and a baby due in march 2010, i'm going to shut down the blog (formally, since i haven't posted in months!).  i'm going to leave it up,  but close down comments. if you want to reach me, i can be reached on ravelry.  my personal account name is kristineknits, and i also have a joint account with dr. liz under carpe fiber.  we are currently in the midst of putting together quite a few designs we'll be "ravelry publishing" under carpe fiber designs. adieu!

second sock syndrome vanquished!

i've had "sheri's lace sock" on the needles since early 2006.  after finishing the first sock, the second was a non-starter for a very long time.but in the passt week, i've cast on, and actually turned the heel. i'm in the home stretch! hopefully.

little orphan blog

my poor blog. it's been orphaned in favor for ravelry. i've been posting and updating my finished and new projects on ravelry and totally forgot to update the blog. no more! i have just finished an old stash project- it was actually my standby project for when i wanted something simple to work on. behold.... the squiggly baby blanket. this project was started with leftover stash yarn, and was originally started for my niece's birth. fyi- she's four years old. part of the reason it took so long was that it used baby weight yarn in a small needle size. in retrospect, a bad choice for speed, but it resulted in a very nice closeup look. not one to laze about, i immediately cast on for a new baby blanket- this one in a medium blue worsted weight yarn. i wanted to make a cable patterned blanket, so i pulled out my grandmother's stitch pattern book and flipped through until i found something suitable. three cable patterns and one lace pattern later....i had a couple of flights last weekend, so i had some major progress. :)

counting chickens

it seems i spoke too soon.  for some reason, the "leaves" looked like blobs.  i suspect my needle size might be too large, or the stitch patterns too small. whatever the reason, the turquoisey alpaca yarn is now all wrapped up again in the statsh, waiting for more reliable inspiration.  i think maybe a think honeycomb or stitch pattern might do the trick, but i'm going to wait until i can go to the library and check out a couple of knitting books.so instead, i cast on a different scarf. of very bulky proportions... size 11 needles, and it has rows of wrapped stitches, so i think this will be done very quickly.  i need some knitting progress!

call: false start!

i have a new project.actually, i could say that i've had about 5 new projects over the last few days. i've been starting to knit with this great turquoise dk weight alpaca, but everytime i found a new lace pattern, i was bored. or i hated the way the alpaca made the pattern look.  the lace patterns were not crisp enough, and the cables didn't pop.but now, i think i found a pattern. branching out. from spring 2005- thank you ravelry for showing me the way!

about me

name:  kristine 
location:  south bend, indiana, united states 
i'm a brand new lawyer in indiana, who rationalizes her knitting and spinning time as needed “relaxation time” from the crazy world of law, which is surprising less crazy than law school.  i often can be found procrastinating over needles or a spinning wheel with local knitting groups.
