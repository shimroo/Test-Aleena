academics

		in a christian liberal arts and sciences education, learners make connections across the disciplines. at every level of study, curricula are interwoven to develop a deep sense of awe and wonder at the order of god's creation. this education invites scholars to consider what kind of life they want to live, and gives them the tools to be courageous, creative, compassionate, tenacious, and engaged learners and leaders.
