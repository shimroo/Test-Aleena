chad & jeremy















from humble beginnings in coffee houses and folk clubs in london, chad stuart and jeremy clyde were discovered by famed movie composer john barry and recorded a string of hits - “yesterday’s gone”, “summer song", “willow weep for me”, “if i loved you” “before and after” and “distant shores”. as former drama students, they were quickly snapped up by hollywood (“we had long hair and could string a sentence together”), appearing as themselves in legendary television shows including the dick van dyke show, the patty duke show, laredo (a western yet!) and batman.after two classic cult albums (meaning they didn’t sell at the time!) in the form of of cabbages & kings and the ark, they disbanded in 1968, with latter day reunions galore. this is their story, and a whole lot more.
