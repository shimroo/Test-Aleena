how to get your ged online

have you been putting off getting your ged because it will take too much time? here are three things that will change your mind.

the ged test is a lot easier than you think. the passing score is just 45% correct. that’s right, less than half correct answers to pass!
our automated learning system figures out exactly what you need to know so you don’t waste your time. this is why most of our students get their ged in 6 weeks or less.
our student success coaches will answer your questions and give you tips and shortcuts to speed up your learning process.
