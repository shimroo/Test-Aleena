about lutheran hour ministries








our story
our mission
our vision






lutheran hour ministries began at the grassroots level as the lutheran laymenâs league, a group of 12 laypeople who came together to support the church in word and deed. what began with 12 has become a movement of tens of thousands of volunteers and supporters around the globe. in 1930, âthere is a godâ were the first words spoken on the lutheran hourâ® radio program broadcast over the airwaves to thousands of listeners. today people around the world experience the gospel through lhm programs, services, or materials nearly 235 million times each week.



our first ministry center opened its doors in the philippines in 1940; today we are able to spread the good news of jesus christ to over 60 countries through our ministry centers on 6 continents. with our unique missionary model of employing only indigenous staff, lutheran hour ministries is able to work within the language and culture to communicate the gospel in the context of the local region. for over 100 years, god has used lutheran hour ministries to bring the changeless christ to a changing world. the communication methods have shifted, but the message has remained the same.







lutheran hour ministries employs local missionaries in more than 30 locations to develop culturally relevant ministries to reach the unchurched in more than 60 nations on 6 continents.
