we saw a lot of hype about pokemon go, a game that is now considered one of the biggest mobile apps of the year. pokemon go is a location-based game that uses your smartphone’s camera to overlay a virtual reality world on top of your actual surroundings. it was the first game to break through the walls of the mobile gaming industry, and it has also been credited with helping local businesses flourish due to foot traffic.
the game was developed by california-based software company niantic inc., and it is free to download. the game boasts a few technical tricks of the trade, such as its ability to use a gps signal to map your location. it also includes an optional augmented reality feature, which puts you in the shoes of a pokemon trainer.
there’s a lot to like about pokemon go, but there’s also a lot to dislike. some users have complained about the game’s reliance on cell signal, which causes it to be slow and clunky. other users have reported that their phone’s battery life is negatively impacted. some people have even sold their houses for cash in florida to get away from the massive amounts of players roaming the streets! despite these concerns, pokemon go remains one of the top mobile apps of the year.
pokemon go is an entertaining game that encourages players to get out of the house, exercise, and play with friends. it’s also a fun way to get your kids moving. unlike most mobile games, pokemon go encourages users to be active and see the world around them in a whole new light.
while pokemon go isn’t the first game to use augmented reality, it’s the first game to make use of the latest technology. one of the most exciting things about pokemon go is that it allows users to discover pokemon in locations they might not otherwise have visited. in fact, 44 percent of people who visited historical landmarks in the united states have credited the game with their visit.
while some critics argue that pokemon go hasn’t been a game changer, it certainly has been the newest thing to hit the mobile landscape. the game’s most recent updates, including an increase in the level cap, have further improved the experience. it also has been credited with helping to promote civic engagement. one study suggests that users who play the game spend a total of 50 minutes more exercising each week than those who don’t.
one of the coolest aspects of pokemon go is the fact that it uses your smartphone’s camera to overlay augmented reality on top of your real world surroundings. this is a fairly new technology, and it isn’t a surprise that the company behind the game is using it to the fullest.
the pokemon company has a history of creating some of the most entertaining games in the past, from the game boy to the game cube. pokemon go was released in september, and has been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of 2016. the game is expected to gross more than $6 billion by 2020.

legislation to rewrite florida’s gaming regulations

despite the fact that florida has been a leader in the gaming industry for a long time, there have been many issues that have plagued the industry. the laws and regulations have made it difficult for operators to know how to run their businesses. a mishmash of different laws and regulations have created uncertainty for legislators and operators. this has led to dozens of lawsuits over the past year. thankfully, the florida division of parimutuel wagering has acknowledged that the laws are outdated and is preparing to rewrite the industry’s regulations.
the seminole tribe of florida operates the gaming industry in florida. the tribe runs six casinos in the area. it has invested more than $10 million in pacs in order to protect its compact with the state. the compact will allow the tribe to construct three more casinos in the state. it is expected to generate billions of dollars for the state over the next few years. the compact also authorizes the tribe to offer exclusive parimutuel sports such as craps and roulette. however, the deal is not yet clear and will require federal approval.
in order to protect the compact, the seminole tribe has started a political action committee to fund voter initiatives. the group says that the compact is a good move for the industry as a whole. some gaming companies are against it, but the deal was approved by the governor and the tribe. several counties have voted to legalize gaming.
the florida division of parimutuel wagering acknowledges that the laws are outdated, but has spent thousands of dollars defending them. the agency has also allowed slot operators to run electronic roulette in miami and a one-time race in hallandale beach. however, the slot machine market in jacksonville has been struggling. the florida horsemen’s benevolent and protect association recently won a lawsuit against the agency.
the house republican leader, dana young, is trying to update florida’s gaming laws. the bill would allow wider gambling throughout the state. it would also create the florida gaming control commission. this agency would be overseen by the attorney general’s office. the commission would be responsible for regulating the gaming industry.
while the bill has passed the senate regulated industry committee, it has yet to be approved by the house. the committee will hold public hearings in four different cities in florida. this includes the tampa bay area, where the senate’s committee on gambling has studied the area’s market. it is expected that the expansion of gambling will have little social impact, but will have a moderate impact on the economy.
however, the expansion of gambling will be a priority for the industry. according to a university of florida study, tourists stay longer when they gamble and spend more money. the study also found that the average cash value of a gambler in florida is $866. while this figure may be low, the study suggests that the number is high.
the senate gaming committee met in tallahassee to hear preliminary findings. it was expected that the report would be released last week, but it did not. the senate’s committee has ruled that the report is too confusing. it has also ordered that the report be finished within 30 days.
