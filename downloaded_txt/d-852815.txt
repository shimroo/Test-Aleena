california power systems services now provided through aircraft spruce






 




california power systems (cps) moved to corona, ca in november 2011 and over the past ten years we have provided rotax parts and service to owners of rotax powered aircraft as the isc for the western u.s. unfortunately, cps is no longer an isc and is unable to order parts engines or parts from rotax. the cps website is now being redirected to www.aircraftspruce.com so that former cps customers have access to the wide selection of aviation products available from aircraft spruce. we will continue to sell our existing rotax parts inventory through aircraft spruce, but for rotax parts that we do not show in stock please contact lockwood aviation or leaf. 
thanks to the thousands of cps customers who have supported our efforts to supply you with rotax engines and parts over the years, and we look forward to continuing to supply your other aviation parts requirements through aircraft spruce.

for current customers of california power systems with open orders or backorders waiting for stock, we have created new profiles on the aircraft spruce website to access your cps order history. your user id will be your california power systems user id with "cps-" in the front. for example, if the user id was bsmith, the new user id will be cps-bsmith. in order to access the profile, you will need to reset your password by clicking here.

          best regards,
