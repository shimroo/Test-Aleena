                        extraordinary                    
our technician, chad, was extraordinary.  he was knowledgeable, extremely helpful, and friendly.  chad spent hours identifying our personal television and audio needs.  he removed outdated hardware, decreased and organized wires, and made "our system" so much easier to use.  my husband and i could not be more grateful for his hard work and expertise.
