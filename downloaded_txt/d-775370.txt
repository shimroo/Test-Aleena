we're debt freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!





hey y'all.  long time, no post.  sorry about that.  i am not dead, i did not secretly run off and have a baby, i did not get abducted by aliens...i just kind of burned out on the blogging thing, then a lot of stuff happened. :)  i may (or may not- who knows?)  update about that later.

i *did* however want to pop in to announce something.

we paid off our mortgage on thursday, may 29 .






for reals, yo.

we. paid. it. off.  that sucker is gone, and we are debt free.

i am stunned.  we have purposed to do this since the moment we decided to take the mortgage out, but to actually have it done is...i mean....i'm speechless.  i don't even know what to say in this post.  just that we did it, and it can be done, and we are now 100% debt free, including the mortgage.

5 holiday stress busting tips





we're heading into the christmas crunch time!  here's some small ways to avoid the crazy this year:know your limits. i'm an introvert, and i had to learn to say no to most parties for my own sanity.  i go to parties of good friends and say no to the rest.  the world has not ended yet!don't let anybody else dictate what this time of year must mean for you and your family. scale down. what can you let go? do you hate having a christmas tree?  don't have one!  does your family enjoy cinnamon rolls from a can?  i won't tell!  this goes along with not letting others dictate what your holiday should mean/be to you and your family. if you're buying new gifts, do your shopping online as much as possible.  many places offer free shipping for orders over a certain amount- take advantage of that!  staying out of the stores this time of year=a much more sane frugal homemaker!wrap presents as soon as you bring them home/get them in the mail.  nothing is more stressful than frantically wrapping gifts at midnight on christmas eve!how are you going to stay sane this year?
