education writers association casts its narrowing gaze on boston, may 1-3, april 2016
fordham institute's pretend research, pioneer institute report [download], february 2016

the fordham institute has long been at work on a study of the relative quality of tests produced by the two common core-aligned and federally funded consortia (parcc and sbac), act (aspire), and the commonwealth of massachusetts (mcas).  what fordham has produced is only in the most superficial way an actual analysis. in fact, it reads more like propaganda and lacks the basic elements of objective research.

it takes only a little digging under the surface to reveal pervasive conflicts of interest, a one-sided sourcing of evidence, and a research design so slanted it cannot stand against any scrutiny. in developing their supposedly analytic comparisons of parcc, sbac, aspire and mcas, the authors do not employ standard test evaluation criteria, organizations, or reviewers. instead, they employ criteria developed by the common core co-copyright holder, organizations paid handsomely in the past by common core's funders, and predictable reviewers who have worked for them before. the authors also fill the report with the typical vocabulary and syntax of common core advertising: positive-sounding adjectives and adverbs are attached to everything common core, and negative-sounding adjectives and adverbs are attached to the alternatives.

no reader should take the report seriously; those who produced the report did not. fordham institute used to do serious work; in the area of assessments and standards, sadly, that is no longer the case.  


fordham report predictable, conflicted, november 2015
setting academic performance standards: mcas vs. parcc, november 2015

how parcc's false rigor stunts the academic growth of all students, pioneer institute report [download] (written with mark mcquillan and sandra stotsky), october 2015.

...compares parcc, which is based on common core's k-12 english and math standards, to pre-common core mcas reading and writing tests. among its many findings, the study demonstrates that parcc fails to meet the accountability provisions set forth in the state's memorandum of understanding with the u.s. department of education in order to qualify for race to the top funding in 2010.

the pre-common core mcas tests were chosen in part because mcas is now based on common core standards, not the state's pre-2011 standards. pre-common core mcas tests were also chosen because of the dumbing down of 10th grade mcas tests. what was at the very least a failure by the state to maintain the academic rigor of 10th grade mcas tests is one reason why the authors recommend that mcas 2.0 be developed by an entity independent of the state department of elementary and secondary education.

the authors also dispute claims that parcc could simultaneously determine whether students are academically eligible for a high school diploma and ensure college readiness.  high school is radically different than college, and the academic demands of various post-secondary programs vary dramatically.  our international competitors use different tests for high school graduation and entrance to post-secondary education.

supporters also claim parcc does a better job of testing "higher-order thinking."  in fact, its new types of test items are not research-based and not very good.  they are often difficult to navigate and what passes for testing higher-order thinking are simply multi-step problems.

at the root of parcc's weaknesses are the common core standards to which they are tied.  the authors call on the commonwealth to phase out common core and parcc, and to base a revised mcas on massachusetts' pre-common core curriculum frameworks, updated by pertinent new research.


the revenge of k-12: how common core and the new sat lower college standards in the u.s., pioneer institute report [download] (written with r. james milgram), september 2014.


it is now clear that the original promise to anchor k-12 education to higher education and backmap the common core mathematics standards (ccms) from the upper grades down to the primary grades was empty rhetoric. higher education has scarcely been involved at all, with the exception of the institutions that agreed to place high school students who pass a common core-based high school examination directly into credit-bearing freshman coursework (without
remediation) in return for their states receiving "race to the top" grant funds.

because the ccms are standards for all public school students in this country, regardless of achievement level, they are low standards, topping out at about the level of a weak algebra ii course. and because this level is to determine "college readiness" as they define it (which is not remotely what our public four year college and universities currently assume it to be), it is apt to mean fewer high school students taking advanced mathematics and science coursework before they go to college, more college freshmen with even less knowledge of mathematics than currently, and more college credit-bearing courses set at an international level of seventh or eighth grade.

however, the greatest harm to higher education may accrue from the alignment of the sat to common core's high school standards, converting the sat from an adaptable test predictive of college work to an inflexible retrospective test aligned to and locking in a low level of mathematics. this means that future sat scores will be less informative to college admission counselors than they now are, and that the sat will lose its role in locating students with high
stem potential in high schools with weak mathematics and science instruction.

test frequency, stakes, and feedback in student achievement: a meta-regression evaluation review, august 2019)







background:  test frequency, stakes associated with educational tests, and feedback from test results have been identified in the research literature as relevant factors in student achievement.
objectives:  summarize the separate and joint contribution to student achievement of these three treatments and their interactions via multivariable meta-analytic techniques using a database of english-language studies spanning a century (1910â2010), comprising 149 studies and 509 effect size estimates.
research design:  analysis employed robust variance estimation. considered as potential moderators were hundreds of study features comprising various test designs and test administration, demographic, and source document characteristics.
subjects:  subjects were students at all levels, from early childhood to adult, mostly from the united states but also eight other countries.
results:  we find a summary effect size of 0.84 for the three treatments collectively. further analysis suggests benefits accrue to the incremental addition of combinations of testing and feedback or stakes and feedback. moderator analysis shows higher effect sizes associated with the following study characteristics: more recent year of publication, summative (rather than formative) testing, constructed (rather than selected) item response formats, alignment of subject matter between pre- and posttests, and recognition/recall (rather than core subjects, art, or physical education). conversely, lower effect sizes are associated with postsecondary students (rather than early childhoodâupper secondary), special education population, larger study population, random assignment (rather than another sampling method), use of shadow test as outcome measure, designation of individuals (rather than groups) as units of analysis, and academic (rather than corporate or government) research.








----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the effect of testing on student achievement, 1910-2010 international journal of testing, january 2012)







this article summarizes research on the effect of testing on student achievement as found in english-language sources, comprising several hundred studies conducted between 1910 and 2010. among quantitative studies, mean effect sizes range from a moderate d ≈ 0.55 to a fairly large d ≈ 0.88, depending on the way effects are aggregated or effect sizes are adjusted for study artifacts. testing with feedback produces the strongest positive effect on achievement. adding stakes or frequency also strongly and positively affects achievement. survey studies produce effect sizes above 1.0. ninety-three percent of qualitative studies analyzed also reported positive effects.

correcting fallacies about educational and psychological testing (american psychological association, december 2008)







standardized testing bears the twin burden of controversy and complexity and is difficult for many to understand either dispassionately or technically. in response to this reality, richard p. phelps and a team of well-noted measurement specialists describe the current state of public debate about testing across fields, explain and refute the primary criticisms of testing, acknowledge the limitations and undesirable consequences of testing, provide suggestions for improving testing practices, and present a vigorous defense of testing as well as a practical vision for its promise and future.

those who are charged with translating the science of testing into public information and policy, including administrators, social scientists, test publishers, professors, and journalists who specialize in education and psychology, will find a wealth of valuable information here with which to balance the debate.

standardized testing primer (peter lang, 2007)






the standardized testing primer provides non-specialists with a thorough overview of this controversial and complicated
topic. it eschews the statistical details of scaling, scoring, and measurement that are widely available in textbooks and at testing organization web sites, and instead describes standardized testing's social and political roles and its practical uses, who tests, when, where, and why. topics include: an historical background of testing's practical uses in psychology, education, and the workplace; the varied structures of educational testing programs and systems across countries; the mechanics of test development and quality assurance; and current trends in test development and administration. a glossary and bibliography are also provided. the standardized testing primer is an ideal text for teaching this subject to undergraduate and graduate students.

defending standardized testing (lawrence erlbaum, 2005)






the education reform movement of
the past two decades has focused on raising academic standards. some
standards advocates attach a testing mechanism to gauge the extent to
which high standards are actually accomplished, whereas some critics
accuse the push for standards and testing of impeding reform and
perpetuating inequality. at the same time, the testing profession has
produced advances in the format, accuracy, dependability, and utility
of tests. never before has obtaining such an abundance of accurate and
useful information about student learning been possible. meanwhile, the
american public remains steadfast in support of testing to measure
student performance and monitor the performance of educational systems.
many educational testing experts who acknowledge the benefits of
testing also believe that those benefits have been insufficiently
articulated. although much has been written on standardized testing
policy, most of the published material has been written by opponents.
the contributing authors of this volume are both accomplished
researchers and practitioners who are respected and admired worldwide.
they bring to the project an abundance of experience working with
standardized tests.
the goal of defending standardized testing is to: describe current
standardized testing policies and strategies; explain many of the
common criticisms of standardized testing; document the public support
for, and the realized benefits of, standardized testing; acknowledge
the limitations of, and suggest improvements to, testing practices;
provide guidance for structuring testing programs in light of public
preference and the no child left behind act; and
present a defense of standardized testing and a practical vision for
its promise and future.

kill the messenger (transaction, 1st printing, 2003 (cloth); 2nd printing, 2005 (paper); psychology press, 3rd printing, 2017 (paper)






description: in response to public
demand, new federal legislation requires testing of most students in
the united states in reading and mathematics, for grades three through
eight. in much of the country, this new order promotes an increase in
the amount of standardized testing. many educators, parents, and
policymakers who have paid little attention to testing policy issues in
the past will now do so. they deserve to have better information on the
topic than has generally been available, and kill the messenger is intended to fill this gap. kill the messenger
is perhaps the most thorough and authoritative work in defense of
educational testing ever written. phelps points out that much research
conducted by education insiders on the topic is based on ideological
preference or profound self-interest. it is not surprising that they
arrive at emphatically anti-testing conclusions. he notes that external
and high stakes testing in particular attracts a cornucopia of
invective. much, if not most, of this hostile research is passed on to
the public by journalists as if it were neutral, objective, and
independent. kill the messenger describes the current debate,
the players, their interests, and their positions. it explains and
refutes many of the common criticisms of testing. it describes testing
opponents strategies, through case studies of texas and the sat. it
acknowledges testing's limitations, and suggests how it can be improved.
it defends testing by comparing it with its alternatives. and finally,
it outlines the consequences of losing the war on standardized testing.

the source of lake wobegon
john j. cannell's late 1980's "lake wobegon" reports suggested widespread deliberate educator manipulation of norm-referenced standardized test (nrt) administrations and results, resulting in artificial test score gains. the cannell studies have been referenced in education research since, but as evidence that high stakes (and not cheating or lax security) cause test score inflation. this article examines that research and cannell's data for evidence that high stakes cause test score inflation. no such evidence is found. indeed, the evidence indicates that, if anything, the absence of high stakes is associated with artificial test score gains. the variable most highly correlated with test score inflation is general performance on achievement tests, with traditionally low-performing states exhibiting more test score inflation, on low-stakes norm-referenced tests, than traditionally high-performing states, regardless of whether or not a state also maintains a high-stakes testing program. the unsupported high-stakes-cause-test-score-inflation hypothesis seems to derive from the surreptitious substitution of an antiquated definition of the term "high stakes" and a few studies afflicted with left-out-variable bias. the source of test-score inflation is lax test security, regardless the stakes of the assessment.
