 welcome to rsu59

maine school administrative district no. 59 is nestled in the foothills of maine on the kennebec river. the district is made up of three schools - madison elementary school grades pre-k through grade 2, main street middle school grades 3 through grade 6, and madison junior senior high school grades 7 through 12. additionally, msad59 is fortunate to offer “a school within a school” with the kennebec valley multiple pathways academy. this program offers an opportunity for the at-risk student to gain confidence and realize academic value in an alternate setting with a hands-on approach grades 6-12. the focus of our district is to provide all students with the necessary skills needed to be successful in this everchanging world. a creative and caring staff works together to develop unique and integrating learning experiences for the students that fit all learning styles. our co-curricular and extra-curricular offerings are there to enhance the learning experience as well. we might be on the smaller side in population, but the bulldog pride that is exhibited doesn’t take a back seat to anyone! please feel free to request a tour of the schools, or to speak with the individual administrators to answer any questions you might have. regards,  bonnie levesquesuperintendent of schoolsmsad59
