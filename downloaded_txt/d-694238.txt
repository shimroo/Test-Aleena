welcome to st. alban’sas a diverse, intergenerational, inclusive christian community in the episcopal tradition, we seek the transformation of lives through sharing the gifts of god's grace and love. 














what's happening










churchwide resources

essential resources for immigrant families from episcopal migration ministries: because every family deserves to feel safe, supported, and informed, no matter where they come from or where they are now building their lives. access to accurate and empowering information is vital for immigrants navigating complex systems.defend the dignity of trans and non-binary people in 2025 and beyond: watch this webinar to learn about the present terrain, examine possibilities for future gender justice struggles, and learn from gender justice leaders both within and beyond the episcopal church about the work we can do to uphold the dignity of all god’s children in the face of adversity.read a pastoral letter from bishop andy doyle on the impact of recent executive orders.
















lay ministry training sessions

sundays after the 10am serviceare you looking for a way to be more involved at st. alban’s but not sure where to start? we are always looking for new faces to participate in our sunday services! as the new calendar year begins we are going to host a series of training sessions for folks interested in becoming lectors, intercessors, chalice bearers, acolytes, greeters, and ushers.  these roles are vital to the life of the church and require very little commitment from participants (most folks will serve 1 or more times per month, depending on the chosen role(s)). feb 23rd – greeters/ushersmar 2nd – acolytes
