why choose countryman
why countryman?










isolation

less is more. less distance from you to the microphone means less feedback, less ambient room sound, less gain on the console for less electronic noise and more full, natural sound. countryman microphones achieve maximum isolation by getting close to the source. halving the distance from the microphone to the source increases the incident sound energy by four times, giving you more gain-before feedback and more headroom for the house system and monitors.










ruggedness

stainless steel and aluminum bodies. custom formulated scratch and sweatproof coatings. aramid fiber cables skinned in chemical-resistant polymers. countryman microphones and di boxes are built tough from the inside out for unmatched durability. your gear shouldn't call it a day before you do.










transparency

"transparent" means an acoustic response that doesn't alter your sound, and a low visual profile that keeps all the attention where it belongs. we evaluate dozens of color samples to precisely match our cables, paints, and engineering polymers to carefully selected theater makeup shades.

									“we use our countryman h6 microphones for our weekly services and also utilize them for any dramas that are performed throughout the year...i love the fact that, with their dual ear loops and adjustable headframe, they provide a really comfortable, secure fit that enables one to focus on the message, or in the case of a theatrical presentation, their lines, as opposed to being distracted by an uncomfortable fit. these mics are also extremely low profile, so they’re practically invisible. most importantly, they sound very natural.”
