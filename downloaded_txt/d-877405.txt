our skilled photographer handles diverse photography projects for a wide range of clients. we frequently receive commissions for corporate, industrial, advertising, and annual report photography assignments.
for the past 20 years, we have built a reputation for delivering outstanding industrial, corporate and commercial photography for major organisations across australia.
in a market where image is paramount and competition is intense, our hunter valley photography studio distinguishes itself through a customer centric approach. our meticulous organisation and efficiency are crucial to the success of our professional photography sessions. being well prepared enables me to relax, think creatively and push the boundaries to set new artistic standards.
we serve a broad area extending from southern sydney, north to port macquarie and west to bathurst, including the central coast, lake macquarie, port stephens, maitland and the entire hunter valley, the heart of the new south wales coal mining industry.
for enquiries about the availability of our photographer, as well as pricing for corporate photography assignments, annual reports, advertising campaigns, sales brochures, internal magazines and other business communication needs, please contact us.

we don’t believe in surprises, i learned early that you not knowing what’s going on in my head, is as detrimental to your project, as me not knowing what’s going on in yours. the success of any project depends on collaboration and planning with all parties.
