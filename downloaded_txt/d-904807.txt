kansas city missouri
legendary golf
carved out of the wooded land in swope park, this tight layout, undulated fairways, and multi-tiered greens, provides a true test of golf. skyline views of downtown accompanied by the roars of lions from the k.c. zoo below give this course character that is unmatched anywhere in the city.
