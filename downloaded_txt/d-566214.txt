welcome to the home page of the great dane adoption society and trust fund
the great dane adoption society was founded in 2000 in order to rescue and re home great danes and other large breed dogs. during the following 2 decades we successfully helped over 2000 dogs.
in 2020 gdas was transformed into a trust fund, no longer rescuing dogs ourselves but giving grants to other smaller canine charities. 
we have three types of grants and charities are welcome to apply for one grant each year. each grant awarded is for Â£1000 however on certain occasions the trustees may feel that they wish to award more if they feel that it is for a particularly worthwhile project.
