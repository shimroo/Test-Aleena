pet therapy, inc.established in 1998 in sarasota county, the mission of pet therapy® is to brighten the lives of our elders that are confined to nursing homes & assisted living facilities; as well as returning wounded vets, while educating the public on the importance of volunteerism. the way we do this is by providing visitations with animals (primarily puppies/dogs) using the services of children and adult volunteers. pet therapy® has a positive effect on the resident's physical, emotional and social interactions with others. it reduces stress and helps the patients have a pleasant and meaningful stay and/or recovery. interaction with animals have been shown to reduce blood pressure, increase sensory stimulation, inspire a sense of purpose, increase social interactions with the staff and reduce loneliness by creating a sense of companionship.
