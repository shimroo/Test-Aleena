shuttle
welcome,
you've
come to the right web site if you're interested in renting/leasing an
apartment, condominium, loft, high-rise, or townhome in the austin
metro area.  this area includes downtown austin,
round rock,
pflugerville, cedar park, leander, georgetown, hutto, and san marcos,
texas
areas.    northwest austin has great apartments that
are on
the ut shuttle and there are many beautiful condo and townhome
communities that offer 24 hour maintenance guarantees along with
on-site management.
my
name is constance
h. robinson and i am a licensed real estate agent with 20+
years
in the real estate and
mortgage businesses. over twenty of
those years
have been spent specializing in the leasing of apartments (apartment
locator aka apartment finder) townhomes,
lofts
plus sales of new homes and condominiums.  my
mother was born
and raised in austin where she met my father during world war
ii.
 after traveling around the world via the military, i am very
proud to call austin my home since the mid
70's.  i
work from my home office and i am also the web master of this web site.
are
you tired of trying to find out where the best apartments,
condominiums, lofts, mid-rise, high-rise or townhomes are
located?
have a dog
and want a fenced yard or even a dog park? 
have more than two pets and or need a place to rent with pets that are
of a restricted breed?  would you like to come home to a
relaxing
swim in your lap
pool?
 want stainless steel appliances with granite counter tops?
 have
allergies and can't have carpet so you need faux wood, wood, or
concrete
flooring? do you only like to cook on a gas stove and find that the
apartments are mostly all electric?  no
problem!  let an experienced apartment locator assist
you with your austin home
search for free!
 that's right, the apartment communities pay
apartment locators to bring them qualified tenants and they
pay
us
out of their advertising budgets.    this also saves
the
properties, and their present tenants, from having strangers
 coming and going on their property because they
didn't know
beforehand what the prices or availabilities were at that complex.

how do
my services
work?
 

simple
 steps
 that  save  you  a  lot
 of  time  and  money


your rental
needs will be on an individual basis so please don't hesitate to
contact me with your requirements for
your new
apartment,
townhome, garden home, condo, loft, mid-rise or high-rise. 

you:
read my qualifications and some of my testimonials and
decide to use me as your austin apartment
locator/finder.  
you then email
or call
 me at (512) 835-2169 with your name, move in date, size of
unit
(one
bedroom, two bedroom), area you wish to move (if you know) and any
specific needs you would like to have in your new home.   more
than likely, i will have more questions for you.
i
then hand pick the
properties that i feel best meet your
requirements and acquire your call list.  i do not
merely send
you a huge list of properties off
of a data base and expect you to contact the properties.  i
then personally contact every property on
the
list to find out their
availability dates, rates, and specials for the units that i feel will
be of the most interest to you. 
i then type up the list
and email
you with the property names, addresses, their company web sites, floor
plans, and amenities along with the rental rates, fees and specials.
 
you then
preview the list on your computer;
comparing prices, amenities, pictures of the properties
and floor plans.  you narrow down your choices
and simply email your choices back
with any other questions you may have concerning the complexes.
a
convenient time is set between us to view your properties
in
person unless, of course, you need to lease sight-un-seen.
you view the
properties in person and decide which complex you want to lease and put
down your
deposit and any other fees to hold the unit for your move-in date.
 note:  you do not pay rent or the pet deposit until
the day you go to
the
complex's office to pick up your keys and to sign your lease.
 
i
keep in contact with the property you selected until you're approved
and again to make sure you have a smooth move-in.
i
bill
the apartment complex
for
my services after you have moved into your new home.
simple!  


now,
isn't this a lot simpler than going from complex to
complex
in 106 degree weather only to find out the complex doesn't have a unit
available for you when you need it or they are not within your price
range?  




let 
constance  do
 all  the  work  for  you!





check
out this beautiful condo built community built by a highly recognized
austin environmental condominium builder.  rarely are such
communities in a
for
lease property!  some have upgraded stainless steel appliances
and
granite counter tops.  built with 3 inches of concrete between
each
floor, more insulation between the walls, and double insulated windows.
 gas
cooking!  this
community only has two floors so
the top
floor is the second floor.  some units even have hardwood
flooring.  built on many acres along a gorgeous canyon, most
of
the units have beautiful views.  ready for september move
ins, this
complex
is very well managed.  this is a must see pet friendly
complex with lots of green space for you and your pet(s)!
 cats
are welcome too as they will love lying on the patio and watching all
the birds n the trees.
