people helping horses, helping people
our charity values the mutual respect and compassion between people and horses. horse and human interaction is key to the success of our discovery programme. we share a belief that horses deserve happy, peaceful lives and we should provide them with care, respect, and love.








passionate about life-long learningour charity is built on the mutual respect and compassion between people and horses; from donors, legacy pledgers and adopters, through to our team of dedicated staff, volunteers and supporters, we all share a common belief that horses deserve to live happy and meaningful life and value the incredible trust and companionship that they bestow upon us.












help us continue our work
our work is funded entirely by donations from people like you. with your support we can rescue the horses who need us most.

rehoming
by rehoming a horse from us, not only are you giving a rescued horse a second chance at finding a loving, forever home, but are also helping to free up crucial space at our yard, allowing us to rescue more horses in need of our help. here you can read all about the rehoming process and view the horses looking for homes.

                    "as i observed horseworld’s work it became clear that its main goal is to improve the lives of horses and children. by now a great portion of the horse world knows that these two subjects are the prime motivations of my life. anyone who loves animals should become familiar with this charity and wherever possible assist horseworld with its laudable efforts."
