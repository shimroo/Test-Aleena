st. louis pennsylvanian 
    fossils of the altamont formation
    the i-170 exposure includes the fossiliferous lake neosho shale member


the i-170 pennsylvanian 
    exposure in st. louis, missouri
    this link takes you to a discussion by dr. norman r. king, professor of 
    geology at the university of southern indiana, about the rocks 
    exposed at the i-170 highway cut. dr. king describes the rock units 
    and correlates them with rock units elsewhere in the midcontinent 
    region. he interprets their environments of deposition, and also places 
    them in the context of larger-scale geological processes taking place 
    in the midcontinent region and around the globe during the 
    pennsylvanian period.

    unusual mississippian (early carboniferous) fossils that occur 
    in the midcontinent region of north america. the fossil, 
    evactinopora, a bryozoan colony, stands distinct because 
    of its star-shaped form.

this website is presented to showcase carboniferous 
    fossils of the 
    moscow region of russia; an area that is world famous for beautifully
    preserved fossils. this website provides an opportunity to see fossils
    of those deposits that are poorly known outside russia or have not 
    been illustrated with high quality photos. some of the late 
    carboniferous (pennsylvanian) fossils occur in both the moscow 
    region and in the american midcontinent. 
this web site is presented as a vehicle to provide 
    documentation of 
    some important fossil sites and to provide an educational resource 
    for persons wanting to know more about late carboniferous fossils. 
    the web site is the responsibility of mr. barry sutton, dr. tom yancey 
    and dr. alexander davydov (m. d.)
