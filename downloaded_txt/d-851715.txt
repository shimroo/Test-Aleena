another
highlight is a signature caviar martini, playing on traditional russian
caviar service, wherein fish eggs are chased by ice-cold vodka. "we
infuse nori and butter into vodka," he says. "the martini is served
with a tiny pretzel, filled with smoked creme fraiche and topped with a
little crown of caviar. in italy we say, 'you go to rome, you visit the
pope.' we will be saying, 'you go to society, you have a caviar
martini.'"
