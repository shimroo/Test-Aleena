welcome back!

glacier wilderness resort was founded in 1979 with the last of our 10 cabins built between 1979 – 1982.
we are constantly changing with the times yet maintaining our original idea of charm and warmth not experienced in most of today’s big resorts. we remain rustic, yet up to date and welcoming for guests and their families from around the world.  this resort offers luxury individual one and two bedroom log homes. each is fully equipped with a fireplace, complete kitchen with microwave and dishwasher. full bathrooms with washer and dryer. each log home also has a private hot tub on the covered deck. satellite tv in each cabin as well as dvd players. all linens, cooking and eating utensils are provided.
with only ten cabins there are no crowds here, just a lot of peace and quiet. let glacier wilderness resort become your home away from home as you explore glacier national park and the surrounding back country. stay with us and experience the tranquility of the montana wilderness.
awaken to mountain views or take a leisurely stroll to our waterfall. after a day of exploring glacier national park, enjoy a refreshing dip in our indoor heated pool or just relax at your cabin in your own private hot tub. winter guests will especially enjoy the hot tub after a day on the resort’s groomed x-c ski trails. gather for an evening in the lodge playing a game of pool or sitting by the fireplace reading a book from the resort’s library. a fitness center is located in the lodge as well.
we are located just ten miles east of the west entrance to glacier national park at mile marker 163.1 on hwy 2 e; nestled in the forest on the edge of the great bear wilderness.  and we are open year round!!!!!!!
