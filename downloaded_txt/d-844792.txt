	 a revealing day at jumpusa...
    


+=============================+| nov-02-06: thursday, 4.07pm| los angeles, usa time+=============================+"just two days ago i spent three hours at jumpusa,with their president and creator of the jumpsoles,mr. john kim.what he had to say shocked me... so much so, thati call it ~hidden inches~"... not only did john and i sit down at the "roundtable" to discuss the very future of improvingvertical leap and where athletic performance isheaded... but we also shared our vision of how wecan continue to support and work together as aunified team, giving athletes the very best.you see - as you may or may not know - it's verypossible that my *double your vertical leap*system could be out of circulation by the startof next year.--> yep, as soon as a few weeks.to update you... the group repping the germanolympic association has bumped up their exclusive-rights offer to over $us13 mil. that's a lot ofmoney...but now *three more teams/organiations* havejoined the bidding, with the german's wanting toclose the deal by new year.so, put simply, the time you have to get yourhands on what's been labelled "the greatestadvance in vertical leap training" is rapidlydiminishing...because as soon as this bidding closes, they ownthe upn system and *double your vertical leap*and it will be locked away from the public...forever!but... what has this got to do with jumpusa??--> a lot, as it turns out.if you've known me for a while, you'll also knowthat a *lot* of people have flocked to theinternet to sell all kinds of vertical leaptraining gimmicks... all who see my success andhope to cash in on it - without any of the largelist of pro career accomplishments i have.it's appauling.and i can guarantee you, you just would *not*believe what goes on in the background... thepeople who come crawling to me with their tailsbetween their legs, begging me to help them.i guarantee your jaw would drop if i named names,and a lot of websites would go out of business,as well... a lot of "vertical leap" trainers.pfffffft - most of these cats are a joke, hidingbehind their computers, hoping no one ever findsthem. what they don't get is that you can't dowhat i do, if you haven't done what i've done.to be blunt, no one else has done what i've done.over the past 4 years of working online, i'veseen so many come and go that it's a joke... andthe regular athlete has simply no idea where toturn.so... sitting at our "round table" john and idecided we would join together and do somethingabout it.you see, if it so happens that my system is soldoff to a large international sporting group, iwill not be able to sell *double your verticalleap* anymore, but...i will be able to advise athletes one-on-onethrough an exclusive online community... justas long as i don't sell *double your verticalleap*.so, as a matter of public safety and a gift to anathletic community we feel so protective over, wemight start some kind of internet alliance,geared towards delivering all the best and *none*of the rest to hard-working athletes.... all 100% free!--> nice, huh?is that *hidden inches*?no - that's something else i'm going to e-mailyou about.you'll love that. it's a training must-have...straight from the creative jumpusa offices!i enjoyed my time visiting with jumpusa and ican only recommend them as the highest-of-high-class operations, and certainly the marketleader when it comes to vertical leap traininggoods and products.their commitment to *you* is second to none - infact, here's a $10 discount i arranged:--> jumpusa $10 discountin the meantime, you've got only 7 weeks untilchristmas, so place your order for the limitedrelease *double your vertical leap*... now:http://www.theverticalproject.comthose german's are knocking... and more and moreorganizations are entering the bidding each andevery day!very soon... your chance will be gone.--> forever!don't miss out, go now:http://www.theverticalproject.comfailure is impossible.train hard and train *smart* - system gone soon:http://www.theverticalproject.comfor god's sake, use your brain.train *smart*, you may never get the chance again!order now:http://www.theverticalproject.comto your success - without failure,luke lowreycreator, theverticalproject.com===============================-> jump higher and increase your vertical jump-> with double your vertical leap:-> http://www.theverticalproject.com- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ---------------------------------------------------© the vertical project, 2006. all rights reserved.--------------------------------------------------
