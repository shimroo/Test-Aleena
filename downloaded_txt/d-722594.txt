i did it! got my “block of fame!”… thank you tennessee fitness spa for giving me a whole new outlook on life, and teaching me how to be a healthier, more fit person. biggest thanks of all to my girl…kimi sue kelley! weighed in at 123.3 today. lost 46.3 pounds and 15.3+ percent body fat in 6 months.


“one day & one pound at a time!”

i have struggled with weight gain all of my life. in the last few years, in particular, that weight gain has affected my health. two and a half years ago i discovered tennessee fitness spa. these pictures reflect that first visit of five weeks. i was able to lose just over 20 lbs. during that period of time. between the diet of healthy foods that belinda had me on and the physical fitness routine that kimi sue had me pursuing, my excess pounds didn’t stand a chance. i’ve had times when my weight increased again but a two-week visit to the tennessee fitness spa always gets me back on the right track. it’s a system that works!
dan j.after a very hectic summer, i decided to come here to get away from it all, refuel and regroup. what a great decision that was. the “spa” is rustic, remote, and absolutely wonderful. all of the staff here are nice, knowledgeable, and engaged in making sure each guest is getting from their stay what they came for. in reality, the clientele speaks for itself. of the 35 or so guests on site this week, there are only maybe 3 who are first-time guests. after being here, i understand why. i’m already looking forward to my next visit. the food is protein-rich, balanced, and delicious. the grounds and surrounding area are absolutely gorgeous so the daily walks are something to really look forward to and enjoy each morning. there is no judgment, only encouragement. it is not a glitz and frills spa… it is so much more than that. the simplicity and casual atmosphere is refreshing. my room was basic and comfortable with a lovely porch equipped with a swing and rocking chair. i couldn’t ask for anything more and this has been and is just what i was looking for.
absolutely wonderful
