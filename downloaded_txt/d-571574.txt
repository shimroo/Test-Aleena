computer science






welcome to the department of computer science
the discipline of computer science is a rapidly expanding frontier with unprecedented opportunities, making it an amazing time to go into computing. computers are a growing presence in all aspects of modern society, and there is a large and increasing demand for computing professionals not currently being met. unemployment is near zero for computing professionals, who earn some of the highest salaries in north america.
but it's not just money and jobs that make computing such an exciting profession - computing-related careers are some of the most versatile, creative, and satisfying. computational thinking and skills are valuable complements to virtually all other career areas.
memorial university’s department of computer science was formed in 1978, consisting of seven faculty members and two support staff. today, it is one of nine departments in the faculty of science, with 19 faculty members, two lecturers, 12 staff, and several hundred graduate and undergraduate students.
the department offers the following degree programs:

bachelor of science (computer science)
bachelor of arts (computer science)
bachelor of science (hons.)
bachelor of arts (hons.)
master of science (course based)
master of science (thesis based)
doctor of philosophy (computer science)
