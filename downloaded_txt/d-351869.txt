understanding personal injury cases in-depth 

lawsuit: 
there are cases in which an individual files a lawsuit against some other individual who has acted in a negligent or irresponsible manner which in turn has resulted in an injury to that person. these cases go in court because the parties that were involved in an accident don’t reach any settlement at their level. these cases are solved through a proper court hearing in court with the help of injury attorneys. 

informal settlement: 
these account for the majority of the cases of personal injury. in these cases both the parties resolve the issue through an agreeable amount of money which the person responsible for the injury pays to the person who has incurred an injury. an agreement happens that none of the parties will take any further action on the particular incident and the issue will be resolved right at the moment when the payment is done.
