babettes has permanently closed. may 9, 2022 





















						chef marla adams has retired babette’s cafe. 





all good things must come to an end.  i’ve written a couple of long letters over the last few years about retiring, failing at retirement.  but here i am, ready for a new chapter in my life.  i am so fortunate to have been able to have a career as a cook, a chef, a restaurateur.  there is no other career that would have given me such joy, excitement and camaraderie.
any business has its share of frustrations, downturns, and even heartache.  but you, our audience, have been there for us.  it is remarkable how many of you have become a regular part of babette’s cast of characters and friends.  we have celebrated anniversaries, birthdays, marriages, losses and just some plain old dinners together.  i know this news will be a disappointment to many.  and this is not insignificant to me.
what will i do?  i will travel, go camping with my dogs, put my feet in the dirt in my garden.  i will spend time with my family.  i will rest.  i will try to find peace and ease.  i will sit by the ocean in scotland.  i will work on a cookbook.   i will hold close memories of evenings with you.  you and babette’s will always be part of who i am.
i hope a memory from babette’s will make you smile.
