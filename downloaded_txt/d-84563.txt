journey to better health

                        until recently, we looked at disease as sets of symptoms caused by poor function or non-function of specific organs or body parts. medical professionals everywhere are taught to look for and to treat symptoms, rather than to look further to find their causes. if we looked for causes, most could be found easily, allowing symptoms to be reduced or effectively mitigated.
