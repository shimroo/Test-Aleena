before


after












for security 
              reasons, the photo (above right) is only a representation of what 
              the keyghost key logger (stand alone unit) looks like. the actual 
              keyghost key logger is injection moulded to look exactly like an 
              emc balun.



 
        easy to use. no new software to install or learn. (software free device)
 installs 
        in seconds, just plug it in. 
 can be 
        unplugged and information retrieved on another pc. 
 uses no 
        system resources. 
 excellent 
        real-time backup device. 
 
to install the external 
        keyghost hardware keylogger you simply 
        unplug the keyboard cable from the back of the pc, plug it into one end 
        of the keyghost, then plug the other end back into the pc. 
 
why 
        do you need a keyghost hardware keylogger?
keyghost 
        hardware keyloggers protect computer resources and increase computer security.
several areas have 
        been identified where a hardware keylogger, like the keyghost, is in great 
        demand: 
 
        as a key logger tool for computer fraud investigations.
  
        as a monitoring device for detecting unauthorised access. 
 
        as a deterrent, to prevent unacceptable use of company resources.
  
        as a back up tool which creates a log of all keystrokes typed on a keyboard.
 
but 
        i use a software 'key logger' program...






article 
                  



 over 
                    $120 billion was lost in the usa due to employee fraud last 
                    year. and this figure is growing. 






as a user's technical 
        knowledge increases and weaknesses in software become well known, software 
        keylogger (key loggers 
        and keystroke loggers) become less effective. if the user is capable of 
        disabling or bypassing the security system (or manipulating the logs), 
        then there is no record of the break-in or what has been done. investigations 
        of the computer break-in become very difficult, if not impossible. in 
        addition, there is the added risk of the log file being stolen and its 
        sensitive contents read. 
 
advantages 
        of keyghost keylogger:  
 
        easy to install in a few seconds! simply plug it in. installation 
        pictures.
  
        it records every keystroke, even those typed in the critical period between 
        computer switch on and the operating system being loaded.
  
        keyghost even captures and displays key combinations such as ctrl+c, alt+f 
        and ctrl+alt+delete, making it easy to understand exactly what was typed.
 
keylogger works with any 
        pc operating system, and stores a continuous log even across multiple 
        operating systems on one computer.
  
        no software installation is necessary to record or retrieve keystrokes. 
        keyghost is software free! how?
  
        it has a capacity of up to 2,000,000 keystrokes stored with strong 128-bit 
        encryption. (this is approximately 300,000 words, or 1 years worth of 
        typing).
  
        keylogger features looping memory so you will never miss the most recent 
        keystrokes.
  
        impossible to detect and/or disable by using software scanners. 
  
        it is a very user-friendly keylogger which can be easily used even by 
        those with little computer knowledge. it has a very simple operation for 
        such a powerful tool. simply plug the key logger device into the keyboard 
        cable. 
  
        the log in the keyghost cannot be tampered with. it is an authentic record 
        of what was typed, and therefore, it may be used as strong evidence in 
        a court of law.
  
        keyghost hardware keyloggers have been extensively tested for over 5 years 
        on almost every brand of pc, and have received many positive independent 
        reviews. you can be sure our keyloggers work as advertised.

'our keyghost 
              ii pro scores 9/10 rating in pcinsight review. 
               more reviews>>



 
        easy to install in a few seconds! simply plug it in. installation 
        pictures.
 powered 
        from the computer. it doesn't need batteries.
 can be 
        installed even when the target computer is logged out, has a password, 
        is locked or switched off.
 the keylogger 
        device can be unplugged and the keystrokes retrieved on another computer.
 over 2,000,000 
        keystrokes (looping memory) can be stored with strong 128-bit encryption 
        in non-volatile flash memory (same as in smart cards) that doesn't need 
        batteries to retain storage. 
 works on 
        any desktop pc & all pc operating systems, including windows 3.1, 
        95, 98, me, nt, 2000, xp, linux, os/2, dos, sun solaris and beos.*
 no software 
        installation is needed at all to record or retrieve keystrokes. recorded 
        keystrokes can be played back into any text editor using our 'keystroke 
        ghosting' technique. 
 plugs into 
        computers with a small ps/2 keyboard plug or a large din plug. adapters 
        are required to convert it to work with a large din plug.



 



 
        unlike software (and free) keystroke recorders (key loggers), keyghost 
        keylogger records every keystroke, even those used to modify the bios 
        before bootup.
 impossible 
        to detect or disable using software.
 immune 
        to magnetic fields, and is shock resistant.


        what the reviewers are saying about the keyghost keylogger

uniquehardware 
        - keyghost pro se, 6th october 2002

'what 
        is the best keylogger to buy?...in the end, what this all comes down to 
        is how much space can each of these loggers hold. the maximum of the keyghost 
        pro se is 2,000,000! with the keyghost pro se there is 128-bit encryption 
        to prevent unauthorized access of your keystroke logs.'
