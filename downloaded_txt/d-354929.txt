admissionsthere is a difference with single-sex education. at an all-boys school, boys are better able to develop their own uniqueness and individuality. boys have the opportunity to be themselves to pursue their individual academic and co-curricular activities.

alumni inspirations






alex hurtado '11
my time at st. francis provided me with valuable lessons, life-long friendships, and a strong sense of self. i’m very appreciative of the amazing teachers and staff that have dedicated their lives to our success and growth as st. francis gentlemen.





christian hess '12, graduate student
i attribute much of my decision to serve in the peace corps to my education at st. francis. my two years serving in the rural dominican republic were the most expansive of my life, and st. francis’ philosophy of a well-rounded education that’s both academic and service oriented encouraged me to take an alternative path.





dietrich riley '10, luxury estates advisor
st. francis was my dream school not just for its prestigious football tradition or academic excellence, but because it aligned with my core values and passions. it's a campus that inspired me to grow intellectually, personally, and spiritually, surrounded by a community where lifelong friendships and meaningful connections are made.





ryan anaya '16, medical student
st. francis taught me important life skills, such as humility, which allowed me to better recognize and appreciate the perspectives of others. consequently, i feel that i am able to connect with my patients and treat them more effectively. most importantly, i ensure that my patients feel heard and prioritized because of what i learned at st. francis.





nicholas gentili '09
st. francis will always hold a special place in my heart because of the foundation it provided and the lifelong relationships that i made there.





jacob lucas '15
at st. francis i was surrounded by students who were ambitious and constantly striving to be the best version of themselves, which pushed me to be the same way. st. francis instilled the franciscan virtues into my life, making them a staple. specifically, when it comes to charity and service.





michael allen '15
st. francis instilled many strong values that have helped to shape me into the man i am today. the two main virtues that i've applied to my life each day are hard-work and brotherhood. every golden knight will learn the importance of these virtues before they walk across the stage at graduation.





jonathan llamas '08
as i look back on what i have accomplished, i have a deeper sense of appreciation now than ever before and i will forever be thankful to saint francis high school for fostering my faith and encouraging me to pursue a profession dedicated to the healing and service of others.





trae milton '97
the discipline, structure, culture, religion, and traditions of st. francis helped prepare me for both college and manhood. there are four st. francis pillars that are still a constant in my life and the lives of my family: religion, academics, athletics, and friendships.





connor snashall '11
i learned that a huge part of being a leader is choosing to have the right attitude and treating everyone, especially those you’re leading, with the respect they inherently deserve. i continue to value and live out these values in my life and i have sf to thank!





david macauley '00
st. francis taught me what it meant to develop myself as godly man in service to others. that principle, and the work ethic that went with it, has served me well in my personal, professional, spiritual, and family life. st. francis equipped me to use my time, talents, and treasure to support and grow others.
