new version of just follow me







after three years, the rights to just follow me reverted back to me. to keep it in print, i created a new, sleeker version (trim size is now 5x8). there will also be a new kindle version very soon. i took this opportunity to update the cover (added blurbs, updated author bio and photo, new font, and better spine), new interior design, as well as adding an essay about the writing of the novel.

more information coming soon, including information about a goodreads giveaway!

the print version is now available here:
just follow me

a blurb from one of my fave authors







“just follow me is the most moving novel i've read in a long, long time. the characters are heartbreakingly real and every word donald capone writes rings true. at times suspenseful, at other times touching, this is a book that will sweep you into its enormous heart."

—ted heller, author of pocket kings and west of babylon

johnny drake, time traveler on kindle scout






i need your support! amazon has a new way to get published by them. it’s called kindle scout. only writers who had entered their amazon breakthrough novel award contest were invited to submit their finished novels to kindle scout. writers submit their book and then readers get to read excerpts and nominate up to three books that they want to see published by amazon. if published the author gets an advance and 50% of sales. so, i need you to nominate my book.

my book goes live on monday oct. 27th and will stay up for a month, till nov. 26. the site is not live yet, so i won’t know exactly how it looks or works until it is. this will be the link to my book starting monday, oct. 27. (won’t work now):

thank you!
