suntree is a travel club, one that has no property, nor facilities. in the case of suntree, we meet:at the homes of our members for potlucks, swimming, games, hot soaks, conversationon public lands for camping, hiking, water skiingin facilities which we rent - lodging at ski resorts, camping at commercial areas, house boating.we have married people, singles, normal people, eccentric people, nice folks and various ethnic groups represented. our main concern is compatibility between the members. for that reason that we suggest attendance at some of our events prior to making a decision to join the club.our members live in various places all over new mexico, west texas, arizona and other locations in the united states and mexico. this situation makes the "travel" in our name very appropriate since most members have to travel to our events no matter where they might be held.
