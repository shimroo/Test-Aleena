key benefits




stability & performance
hylafax enterprise was written with industrial-scale faxing in mind. it is a very mature software product that runs on the legendarily stable linux operating system. consequently, it can manage several hundred ‘modem’ devices and queue backlogs of millions of jobs on a single server without breaking a sweat, and it can do so for years without a reboot.






fax over ip
the voice industry is undergoing a revolution. circuit-switched (tdm/pots) voice networks are being replaced by packet-switched (voip/sip) networks at a feverish pace. unfortunately, it’s not possible to fax reliably over those shiny new voip/sip circuits! the t.38 fax over ip (foip) protocol was invented to address this problem, and hylafax enterprise includes dialogic’s legendary and industry-leading “sr140” t.38 sip stack/driver to achieve call completion rates that rival the pstn.






virtualization
in the past, fax servers have needed a physical (card-based) interface to the pstn, generally in the form of a pci-based interface card. software-based modems that deliver audio and t.38 packets over a network connection mean we no longer need to use physical fax boards, and so hylafax can be virtualized. we support a wide range of hypervisors (vmware, hyper-v, kvm and others) and we even offer an amazon aws image for those who wish to be 100% cloud-based.






open architecture 
hylafax enterprise’s open source roots have led to a very open and exposed client/server architecture with a myriad of hooks/interfaces that can be used to integrate into almost any application. you can even replace the standard send & receive helper scripts with your own, so there’s essentially no limit to what you can ask hylafax to do with a sent or received fax. hylafax’s client/server api also offers automation of many aspects of the server’s operation and has been implemented in perl, java, .net and others.






expert support
we don’t just support the product, … support is the product! we sell a highly technical product that is often deployed in mission-critical environments and we understand that you need expert support on your very first call. our support is 100% domestic and you’ll never be more than 2 levels of escalation away from the engineers who write the software. we strive for first call resolution whenever possible and achieve this by staffing the front lines with highly experienced hylafax experts who will use science, not superstition, to resolve your problems.









the ifax difference…
ifax solutions is a worldwide leader in providing enterprise fax solutions. as faxing has evolved, from individual fax machines in small offices to large corporate installations sending thousands of faxes an hour, fax software has evolved with it. ifax solutions looks to take this evolution to the next level – by combining the revolutionary open source fax software hylafax with industry-leading hardware, service and support.
