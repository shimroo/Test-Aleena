church isn’t a place.



god moves through relationships, not real estate—so we meet where people do.














we meet like jesus and his friends did: in houses, over meals and listening to his words and doing what he says.



our core values are pretty simple. we want to be known for holy spirit leadership because great leadership stems from faithful servanthood, spiritual family because we find wisdom in people of all generations and walks of life, and training & sending the church on jesus’ mission to make disciples because it is the key to transforming lives and communities.
