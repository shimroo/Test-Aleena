ruling: 
						federal contract controls non-federal klamath water 
						diversions
						capital press, posted to kbc 2/1/25. 

						"the u.s. bureau of reclamation can restrict a 
						non-federal water diversion under its contract with the 
						klamath drainage district, according to a federal 
						appeals court..." 





						klamath water users and bureau of reclamation agree to 
						new programs funds, $33m and $17m, kwua, posted to 
						kbc 2/1/25.
						"the dra, which operates a voluntary program to assist 
						with chronic water shortage for irrigation in the 
						klamath project, would receive $33 million over the next 
						few years to supplement that program with new, 
						longer-term measures...'we 
						expect the program will include three-to-five-year 
						contracts with producers for voluntary land idling, but 
						with the ability to rotate the idled land in an 
						operation,'...reclamation also intends to allocate an 
						additional $17 million of ira funds for programs that it 
						would pursue. these potential permanent reductions of 
						water demand for land not in commercial agricultural 
						production..."



						u.s. house passes bentz legislation benefitting klamath 
						farmers, kwua, posted to kbc 2/1/25. 

						"under the legislation, federal agencies would not be 
						allowed to pass on the costs of operating or maintaining 
						keno and link river dams, infrastructure built and 
						formerly operated by pacificorp, which are not being 
						removed...the legislation would also provide the 
						authority and tools needed for keeping a promise that 
						upstream migration of salmon and steelhead would not 
						impose new regulatory burdens by providing a mechanism 
						for the bureau of reclamation to install and pay for 
						costly measures such as fish screens that would not 
						otherwise be needed.."

interior 
						dept. grants $46m for klamath basin restoration, 
						posted to kbc 12/3/24, including barnes ranch 
						acquisition for birds and suckers, not water storage, 
						and 90,000 acres gifted to klamath tribes.
both have previously been opposed by the 
						public in letters and polls.
						

here for scientists' opposition 
						and letters of opposition by the klamath basin 
						communities, water districts and public officials.
						
"...the service is investing a total of $162 million 
						over five years to restore the klamath region's 
						ecosystem and repair local economies...will secure 
						reliable water for the national wildlife refuges, 
						advance the restoration of salmon post dam removal, 
						address water quality and conveyance issues, and ..."
						$13 million will be used to complete restoration of the 
						agency-barnes wetland units of upper klamath national 
						wildlife refuge and... covering 14,356 acres, the 
						restored wetland will create vital habitat for 
						waterfowl, federally endangered lost river and shortnose 
						suckers, and other species, making it one of the largest 
						wetland restoration initiatives in the united states.
						klamath keystone initiative, "...$31 
						million as part of an agreement, commonly known as the 
						mazama funds, that will allow the klamath tribes to 
						acquire nearly 90,000 acres of private land...(usfws) 
						deployed $26 million from the bipartisan infrastructure 
						law in fiscal year 2022 for klamath basin restoration 
						projects, including nearly $16 million for ecosystem 
						restoration projects in the basin and $10 million to 
						expand the klamath falls national fish hatchery to raise 
						juvenile endangered suckers (cwaam and koptu)." 

kbc note: 
after 
						the klamath reclamation project water was entirely shut 
						off in 2001 and barnes ranch was promoted, the nation's 
						best available science was engaged:
according 
						to dr william lewis, chairman of the national research 
						council: flooding more ag land won't produce more 
						suckers and won't improve klamath lake water 
						quality. also it will raise lake temperatures and 
						evaporate more water than it can store.  
						higher than historic river flows won't help salmon, 
						lower flows didn't kill salmon. nrc: "the 
						water shutoff was unjustified." 

the new deal would 
						"secure water reliable water for the national wildlife 
						refuges." however the recent biological assessment 
						mandates denying much water to irrigators, obliterating 
						our water rights.  
						the barnes ranch acquisition, initially proposed as 
						water storage for klamath project,
						
						was opposed by klamath irrigation district, 
						scientists, representatives, and the public. as with 
						other promises of storage, this acquisition is presently 
						touted as another "restored wetland." 


fyi 



97,160 acres of agricultural land 
                have been converted into wetlands from ag as primary water usage
            
            (above klamath lake).  wetlands 
						use nearly 2ce as much water as ag lands. most of these 
						acquisitions were sold to the public as "water storage 
						for irrigation" and (warm) water to help endangered 
						suckers

"gene 
						souza, 
						will this be like a recent year when the bureau

						again?"  souza: "...yes, 
						reclamation has indicated it will make $8.5 million or 
						so available for a demand reduction program in 2024. 
						this is approximately $4-6 million short of being able 
						to pay mortgages, weed control, equipment loans, seed

						rivers has been reduced for fear that sand washing into

 "...multiple 
										government and private reports have 
										determined that breaching the dams would 
										have a dramatic negative impact on 
										energy production, climate 
										goals and 
										transportation in washington.


									the dams were constructed in the 1960s and 
									1970s by the u.s. army corps of engineers 
									primarily to ensure the snake river was 
									passable for barge transportation. however, 
									since then, the main benefit has been their 
									reliable clean energy output. they still 
									provide about 8% of the state's electricity, 
									enough to serve millions of residents, and 
									have a large total capacity of 3,000 
									megawatts...the river system notably feeds 
									the largest u.s. wheat export 
									gateway...aided by the dams, barges 
									traveling along the columbia river system 
									carry about 60% of washington's annual wheat 
									exports and a staggering 40% of the nation's 
									total wheat production."

						kwua: "...credible parties believe that the project

my question to kwua: who are these "credible 
						parties"?? 
 the 
						national research council (nrc) is the operating arm of 
						the united states national academies of sciences, 
						engineering, and medicine and is overseen by a governing 
						board that consists of councilors from each of the three 
						academies.


						it is the most prestigious science team in america. 


dr. 
						william m. lewis, jr, chair, national research council 
						committee on endangered and threatened fishes in the 
						klamath river basin (2001-2003), attended february 
						3, 2004, at a doi sponsored klamath science workshop in 
						klamath falls. he spoke regarding the nrc conclusions 
						on suckers, lake level and river flow management, and 
						expanding ukl to lower ph levels and help suckers.
"lewis explained that the suckers 
                            were listed since 1988 because of over harvest.  
                            they stopped fishing in '87 but they did not 
                            recover. the lake has gone from 3' range under 
                            natural conditions to experiencing 6' deep in 
                            current dry years. with charts and graphs he showed 
                            the habitat and water quality, algae and 
                            chlorophyll. he said that the committee looked 
                            extensively at water levels, and they find 'no hint 
                            of a relationship'. he also said that there was no 
                            relationship between lower water levels and extreme 
                            ph levels. and "the committee cannot support the 
                            idea that water levels effect algae growth.' "it can 
                            not be achieved by lake levels." '92 was the lowest 
                            water year, and they expected it to be the least 
                            favorable for fish. 'the lowest water year produced 
                            the same amount of larvae as other years."...he explained that clear lake does 
                            not have the habitat that scientists are trying to 
                            create in the upper basin for suckers, yet clear 
                            lake has stable populations of healthy 
                            suckers..."these have all the characteristics we 
                            want in recovered population.  we have to 
                            protect these populations."...lewis was asked about making more 
                            wetlands for suckers, and he responded that there 
                            are 17,000 acres of restoration already. he 
                            cautioned that we shouldn't put too much faith into wetlands 
                            regarding the suppression of algae...he added that we should not 
                            count on retiring agricultural land land for saving 
                            suckers...jacob kann, ecologist and scientist for 
						klamath basin rangeland trust (obrt president is 
						presently on krrc klamath dam destruction board), 
						insisted that timing and flows are related to the ph 
						levels. lewis responded that the water is always ph 
						loaded, "the increase doesn't matter if it's always been 
						saturated"... when asked if it would work to control the 
						significant part of the ph load, lewis responded that 
						the lake is 140 square miles...that is not feasible to 
						change... looking at the data, water level 
                            management just does not line up."

						however, they will rip out the klamath river fish

						bransom: 
						"the upcoming dam removal project has the potential

						prosperity of agriculture and recreation in the klamath 
						basin..." 

kbc 
						note in response: 
						the 4 klamath dams bransom boasts of destroying provide 
						power to 70,000 households. the 20 million cubic yards 
						of toxic sediment behind the dams will obliterate any 
						fish or habitat or recreation in it's way. the beautiful 
						lakes with hundreds of wildlife species including many 
						that are endangered will be drained and replaced with 
						tons of sediment. the local communities will lose their 
						dam lake's/reservoir's recreation and famous fishing and 
						tourism supporting siskiyou county's economy. the 
						reservoirs that support a hatchery producing millions of 
						salmon will be gone as well as flood prevention and 
						water for firefighting that has saved the river 
						communities (including tribal lands) from wildfires. 
						unlike the historically putrid mineral-laden klamath 
						lake water, the dam reservoirs provide deep cold water 
						for downriver fish. our local counties voted 
						overwhelmingly against dam removal as well as our local 
						representatives. department of interior fired the ethics 
						officer, a lead scientist who said the science does not 
						support destroying the dams. when congress didn't pass 
						the demolition plan, the gov't agencies and ngos 
						bypassed congress so oregon and california taxpayers 
						foot the bill. by the way, the hundreds of government 
						agencies and ngos do not live near our rural 
						communities.

press release:
						
						siskiyou county water users association (scwua) filed 
						california taxpayer complaint regarding $250m to destroy 
						klamath dams in wild and scenic designated area december 
						12, 2022


letter 
						from 3rd generation hornbrook, ca rancher rex cozzalio 
						to ferc / federal energy regulatory commission regarding 
						klamath dam destruction 12/12/22 "congratulations!   
						as predicted in my recent unacknowledged and most likely 
						unread submission, you have held tight to 
						policy-directed blinders in imposing unaccountable 
						special interest devastation upon the klamath region, 
						nullifying literal lifetimes of experience and 
						knowledgeable sacrifice enhancing the naturally 
						occurring klamath environment, including fisheries..."

						 

						 




dam 
						celebration, 
						pending removal of klamath river structures feted, 
						h&n 12/10/22. "haaland, 
						the first native american interior department secretary, 
						praised ongoing efforts to remove the dams,...saying, 
						clean water, healthy forests and fertile land made the 
						klamath river basin and its surrounding watershed a home 
						to tribal communities, productive agriculture, and a 
						place where abundant populations of migratory birds, 
						suckers, salmon and other fish could thrive. we must 
						take urgent and necessary action to protect this special 
						place. "about 
						$5.8 million is being made available to klamath rivers 
						tribes...haaland said the funding supplements nearly $26 
						million from the bipartisan infrastructure law allocated 
						this year for klamath basin restoration projects."
kbc note: the ecoterrorists are 
						winning. historically water going down the 
						river from klamath lake was so bad horses couldn't drink 
						from it according to historic journals. the bureau of 
						reclamation dewatered our beautiful refuges in 2021-2022 
						(which included 433 species of wildlife including 
						suckers) in the guise of saving suckers. destroying dams 
						will release more than 20 million cubic yards of 
						sediment, destroy deep dam reservoirs which cool the 
						warm klamath water for salmon and and are used for 
						firefighting, and diminish agriculture.
						our local and regional representatives, including our ca 
						and or us congressmen, and the vast majority of our 
						population oppose hydroelectric dam removal. those most 
						effected by dam destruction, farmers, ranchers, and the 
						people living along the dam reservoirs, were not invited 
						to their meeting. klamath irrigation district manager 
						and kwua member gene souza, along with scwua members, 
						were forbidden to attend and turned away at the gate 
						near the exclusive "celebration". most reporters did not 
						even stop to ask the mostly elderly locals, holding 
						signs standing in the freezing weather for four hours, 
						why they opposed dam removal. our government and media 
						have abandoned us dumb expendable farmers and ranchers 
						and veterans.

						lamprey found in (klamath county's) miller lake  the 
						first findings since the 1950s, h&n, posted to kbc 
						12/2/22. "in the lake, the report says, its likely 
						fish are not killed by lamprey feeding on them....miller 
						lake lamprey were nearly eliminated from the lake in the 
						1950s...fish biologists thought the lamprey harmed other 
						game fish...research team partners have been capturing 
						miller lake lamprey downstream of the lake. captured 
						lamprey are moved to streams above the lake. the goal 
						has been to have the captured lamprey return to miller 
						lake."


modoc 
						nation: new chief focused on moving forward, h&n, 
						posted to kbc 12/2/22. 
						"...formerly 
						known as the modoc tribe of oklahoma...the 
						goal is to improve and develop the tribes california 
						lands, which include about 1,200 acres at and near the 
						tulelake airport...the tribes primary goal for its far 
						northern california lands is focused on rehabilitating 
						about 1,600 acres of sagebrush range lands the tribe has 
						purchased near north of lava beds for a commercial bison 
						herd. the tribe, according to its stewardship proposal, 
						is also hoping to buy another 700-plus-acres north of 
						the existing tribal-owned property..."

						of klamath lake water storage

						water rules add to challenges for farmers, cfbf ag 
						alert, posted to kbc 12/2/22. "...more 
						farmers are feeling the added pinch of groundwater 
						regulations as local agencies implement plans that 
						include pumping limits and new fees to balance long-term 
						groundwater resources as required by the state..."  
						kbc note: we klamath project irrigators paid in full 
						for the klamath reclamation project for water storage in 
						klamath lake to be used to irrigate crops and massive 
						bird refuges, reused 9 times, then sent down the klamath 
						river and into the ocean. bureau of reclamation has cut 
						off irrigators from their stored water, decimating farms 
						and national wildlife refuges, sending the water 
						directly down the klamath river into the ocean, way more 
						than mandated for "endangered" suckers. in our deeds we 
						have water rights to our stored water forever, along 
						with rights to the groundwater under our land. now that 
						the bureau  illegally took our stored water, 
						california can illegally regulate groundwater as 
						thousands of acres of land lie fallow. our klamath lake 
						storage is full, and at times this summer klamath river 
						was at flood stage because the bureau denied us our 
						stored water. so far within tulelake irrigation 
						district, our groundwater is not at a critical stage yet 
						to be regulated.


a plan to fill upper 
						klamath lake 11/22/22, klamath water users 
						association 11/22/22. "...for the fish and the 
						farmers alike, the last three years have more 
						thanconclusively demonstrated that the alternative of 
						not filling the lake is far worse than short-term (and 
						likely beneficial) reductions in river flows. the fact 
						is, there is no possible worse outcome
						for the klamath basin than repeating what has transpired 
						over the last three years."


letter 
						from 
						rex cozzalio, 3rd generation rancher on the klamath 
						river at hornbrook, to ferc/federal energy regulatory 
						commissioner glick regarding the massive destruction and 
						costs to the communities, ecosystems, salmon, and people 
						if klamath dams are destroyed. days 
						later ferc approved destroying klamath river dams, 
						despite science and vast opposition. "all 
						future water must come from unnaturally stored upper 
						klamath lake water owned by and taken from upper basin 
						residents during the most critical times for crop 
						production, causing massive additional harm to the upper 
						basin." posted to kbc 11/20/22

before the 
					klamath project was built, there were up to 30 feet of water 
					where our farms are now. it was a navigable
										
					lake. 
					that's why on our deeds, signed by us president, we were 
					deeded 2+ acre feet of water for our crops, as all the 
					runoff we pump uphill, at our expense, out of our closed 
					basin and into the klamath river. 





the
										
					river occasionally went dry  
					in the fall before the project was built.
