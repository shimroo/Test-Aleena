				testimonials							





wow. bartle hall is such a special place! my husband and i got married here in june and it was the most perfect day! bartle hall was the first venue we visited and we fell in love with the place straight away! we visited a couple of other venues after but nowhere came close. not only is this place an absolutely stunning venue, the entire team were perfect from our initial visit up to and including our special day. jenny & rachel could not have done any more to help with planning and heather did a fantastic job of ensuring the day went smoothly and keeping us both relaxed. our guests absolutely loved the venue and everyone said how amazing the team were. we couldn't have had a more perfect day and would recommend to anybody planning a wedding or event.

i cannot speak highly enough of how amazing bartle hall were on my wedding day. from dealing with my thousand and one questions to handling a seating plan change the night before, nothing was too much effort. the staff throughout the night were incredibly supportive and attentive, and helped rescue my dress when my bustle broke just before the first dance! not only that, but the venue itself is absolutely stunning and the pizzas were amazing. if you're looking for a wedding venue, then bartle hall should definitely be on your list

had our wedding here a few years ago, everything was amazing, the staff really know how to look after you and the food was fantastic! as per of our package we got a bottle of champagne before we left which you would expect to be something non branded but it was a vintage veuve cliquot - they’ve got it all down to perfection - can’t rate them highly enough!
