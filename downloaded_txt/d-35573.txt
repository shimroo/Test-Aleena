"i was very quiet...
...lacked confidence and did not mix with people well. i still am quiet and still find it difficult to communicate with people. however, since joining this site, my confidence has grown a tremendous amount. i have had work published , i have done a whole term in an english course and won an award for student of the year. all of this in little over a year. i believe this has been made possible through joining wdc and i hope it will continue for many more years." -sanita
