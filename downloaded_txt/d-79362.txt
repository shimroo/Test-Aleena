the theatre community loves stageagent!





















gary stanford
director




 as a director, i strongly
                                encourage performers to study stageagent’s show guides before coming to an audition. their
                                expert-written plot summaries and character breakdowns give you a leg up over the
                                competition! 









  stageagent is my "go to place”, a one stop shop to review audition songs, find new monologues, learn more about individual character development, watch videos, read plot summaries, locate local auditions and perform. every year, they add more and more educational avenues for me to gather more information.  as a vocalist and voice teacher for young to advanced singers, i don't dread the busy seasons any more because "i've got a friend"!





paula and richard white











 a
                                fantastic resource for actors and singers who are overwhelmed or confused by the vast sea of roles, breakdowns, and audition songs out there. it's like an
                                encyclopedia for theater and musicals, but way more clear and easy to search.

 stageagent provides one-stop shopping for theatre actors. it's a great place to discover auditions, find audition material, get more exposure for my video reel, and read insightful blog posts from industry experts. 









                                stageagent provides an inside look into plays and musicals from the artists' perspective. it's a great tool for both beginning and experienced theatre
                                artists alike.

elena galvan
opera singer





 the in-depth character descriptions with vocal ranges will save you so much time and help you come prepared for an audition. the iibrary of audition songs with associated context and character descriptions is a fabulous tool for any singer. 









 stageagent is my go-to resource to study character breakdowns. as an actress, i love having one reliable source for show and character information, monologues and audition songs. stageagent helps me come better prepared to auditions and feel that much closer to booking the role.
