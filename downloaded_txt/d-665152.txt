protection of family rights – the campaign ended at syracuse federal building as we attempted to get support from us senators schumer & gillibrand for a family rights act.      “senators help us!   we ♥ r kids”




 

in 2018, john murtari, group coordinator, and other tried almost every week from mother’s day to mid september.   the use of nonviolent action was certainly effective in allowing us to carry out actions that normally would not have been tolerated.   there could have been dozens of arrests – there were only four.  click here for a complete photo/video  journal of activity. we have a grass roots plan for reform, but we need more people.  not only more parents as spectators, but also willing to visit or call local offices.
