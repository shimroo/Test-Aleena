									then youre a newbie. newbies are great! we 
									love em! novice race classes are held in 
									spring and we offer what we call 
									edutainment courses and get-togethers 
									during the winter months to get us up off 
									our couches.  want to cruise?  crew on day 
									sails and short- or long-distance cruises. 
									there are lots of casual opportunities to go 
									out sailing so you can decide whether youd 
									like to get involved with sailing. 
 








 










where 
									to find us

   
									
the grand river part 
									of our club name refers to the scenic 

									grand river that 
									flows into lake erie, about half-way between 
									cleveland and ashtabula. our club members 
									dock at various marinas and yacht clubs 
									along the grand river. 


    
									two small towns are located on either side 
									of the river. to the west is the village of 

									grand river, with 
									waterfront restaurants, rigging and sail 
									businesses, and the us customs call booth, 
									fuel dock, and repair facilities at 

									grand river marine.
									


    
									on the east side of the river, the village 
									of 

									fairport harbor 
									offers restaurants, a small grocery store 
									and convenience marts, a farm market, post 
									office, library, a boating supply shop, 
									museums, and a protected swimming beach 
									within walking distance of dockage.

 



									join grsc!
  
									

although we are known 
									widely as a racing club, grsc has all kinds 
									of members. some have been racing for years. 
									others just got into the sport. there are

									cruisers, single-hand sailors, people who 
									own boats and people who dont. we have crew 
									members who began with no experience and
