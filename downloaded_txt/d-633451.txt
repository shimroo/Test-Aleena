butterfly sugar, baby








 















welcome to my so-called life! 
















isn't stitch the cutest thing?!








 hello and welcome to what is sure to be an experience of sorts.    

they call me alison. by they, i am referring to anyone who is aware of my name. some people of varying importance call me by other names, but alison was the name given to me at birth. alison gail.     

i am 23 years old and reside in queens, ny. i just graduated from queens college in may 2002, with a b.a. in drama/theatre. 

i am the oldest of three. i have two brothers, one of whom is also a drama/theatre major at queens college and is destined to be the next...well, he's somethin' special. :-) my other brother's the smart one. he's only in the 8th grade, but he'll probably grow up to be a botanist or something requiring actual brain power. :-)     

i was born a po' black chile on a spring day in '79. i'm lying...clearly. i'm irish and german, but really i'm a typical american, arean chick who likes to have fun on the weekends and stay out real late.   

i work at a law school. queens college law school, that is. it's less stressful than working for doogie howser, which was my previous job. there are still people here who get on my last nerve but that tends to happen very easily anyway so i do my best to ignore it and just do what i have to do to earn my paycheck.
