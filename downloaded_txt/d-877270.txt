  incidence of covid-19 has paralyzed the âin-clinic or
                        pacer clinicsâ  and the need to now manage more patients remotely is critical to help
                        care for these cardiac device patients. read more on how   cardiac
                            signals can improve workflow managing more patients without creating the need for more
                            staff.  








 cardiac device data management 

gives clinicians peace of mind that all patients with cardiac implanted
                        devices are being followed in line with hrs class 1 recommendations by capturing all
                        transmissions and events that are clinically significant. the time you save downloading
                        transmissions allows for greater focus on device event triage.
                    
 empowers cardiologists, advanced practitioners and enterprises to shift from
                        expensive on-premise legacy solutions with high it overhead to our browser-based zero footprint
                        solution focused on optimizing your clinical workflow.
                    
all device transmissions are delivered 24/7/365 directly from the device
                        manufacturer to your  cardiac signals  account. this automation eliminates the need to
                        constantly check multiple manufacturer device portals to download transmissions saving
                        clinicians time and labor.
                    
 cardiac signals  is easy to operate as a standalone solution or as a
                        solution integrated with your preferred ehr platform. in addition,  cardiac signals  will
                        generate your billing daily or at whatever frequency you prefer to ensure all billable events
                        are captured. the automated billing feature tracks the monitoring period for every device and
                        notifies clinicians when billing is due or overdue and what documentation is needed.
