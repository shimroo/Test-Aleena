    our plants are shipped ready to bloom!
 
established in 1985 we are a family - owned wholesale and mail - order greenhouse located in northern lower michigan.while many mail - order companies provide seeds and bare root stock, we provide you with garden - ready live mature annual plants in large 4 inch pots. these plants are well rooted and ready to be planted directly into your containers, landscape or garden bed s. the size of the plants you receive from us is comparable to what you would probably find at a quality garden center. the height of the plants you will receive depends upon the type of plant you order ranging from 4 inches to 9 inches with the upright growing plants the tallest while the trailing plants are the shortest.
