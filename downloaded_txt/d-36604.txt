 what is reiki?





reiki
is a natural healing method thousands of years old
that heals on all levels: physical,
emotional, mental and spiritual. reiki is
universal life force energy, that which
sustains life and promotes healing in
all living things. reiki practitioners
are channels for this powerful
healing energy. traditional usui reiki
consists of three levels or degrees. a
reiki student is initiated by a reiki
master by way of attunements, which
connects the new 
practitioner
to the healing energy. this powerful healing
method can be
learned by anyone. reiki is not a religion or religious cult. it has no dogma
or specific doctrine of
beliefs. a recipient of reiki energy will receive
benefits whether that person
believes
in the power of reiki or not. schedule a reiki treatment for yourself
today and experience this wonderful healing energy.
