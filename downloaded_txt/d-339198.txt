about bell forest products


birdseye maple & curly maple

located in northern michigan, we are in the center of birdseye maple country. each week local loggers harvest birdseye maple and curly maple (tiger maple) trees and bring them to area log bids. we regularly visit these bids to choose the best logs available. once the auction has finished, the logs are delivered to our sawmill located one-half mile from our warehouse. we mill up the birdseye maple and curly maple (tiger maple) into lumber and then stack it into one of our dehumidification kilns, where it stays for about one month, until dry.
