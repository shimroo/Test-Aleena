welcome 
  to the fergusongolf website
  if 
  you are planning a golf trip to scotland, this site can save you 
time and money. before buying an expensive "package tour," 
  stop long enough to educate yourself.  
i am no longer actively planning trips for golf travelers but 
  am maintaining this website to help golf travelers make affordable trips 
  to scotland and ireland. if you want to travel independently, avoiding the high 
  cost of tour operators, this site is for you. 
attention: golf 
  in scotland: a travel-planning guide with profiles 
  of 74 great courses is now in electronic 
  format only. the print edition is no longer available.

i revised my guidebook in 2021—all 
  updated prices, websites, itineraries, and faqs. 
two ways to buy the 2021 revision of golf in scotland 
  in electronic format: 
1. at amazon.com* 
   or barnesandnoble.com.  both 
  currently sell the file for $9.99. *due to company regulations, amazon continues 
  to show a 2015 publication date for the book. that is not accurate. the electronic 
  file is current to 2021. 
2. with your credit card information, 
  we will send a pdf to you immediately for $10. call 303-722-3441. if we don't 
  answer, leave a message for return call. 
to 
  learn more about my guidebook,
 see the book page. it's 
  the "bible" of scottish golf travel. golf in scotland: a travel-planning 
  guide . . . is designed to make you the expert and save hundreds, 
  even thousands, of dollars on your trip to the 
  home of golf!
