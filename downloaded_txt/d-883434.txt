preventing carbon monoxide poisoning


submitted by webuser on mon, 12/27/2021 - 8:17am 


tips from cdc
do have your heating system, water heater and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year.
do install a battery-operated or battery back-up co detector in your home and check or replace the battery when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall. if the detector sounds leave your home immediately and call 911.
do seek prompt medical attention if you suspect co poisoning and are feeling dizzy, light-headed, or nauseated.
