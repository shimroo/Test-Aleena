john f. kennedy, edward r. murrow, albert einstein... a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. this is the sum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicity...government is not reason; it is not eloquence. it is force. and force, like fire, is a dangerous servant and a fearful master...the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government. thomas jefferson, george washington and patrick henry...dreams are illustrations from the book your soul is writing about you...toleration is not the opposite of intolerance, but is the counterfeit of it. both are despotisms, the one assumes to itself the right of withholding the liberty of conscience, and the other of granting it...dreams are like stars...you may never touch them, but if you follow them, they will lead you to your destiny - marsha norman and george washington...just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. to walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue... no man is great enough or wise enough for any of us to surrender our destiny to. the only way in which anyone can lead us is to restore to us the belief in our own guidance...you may think the president is all-powerful, but he is not. he needs a lot of guidance from the lord. - buddha, henry miller, barbara bush....in law, the proponent is innocent until proven guilty-the golden thread of democracy-neff....controversy equalizes fools and wise men-and the fools know it....in civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics....legal ethics is a misnomer...lawyers conducting themselves legally are not necessarily conducting themselves morally. "...and..."the zero sum nature of the legal system, combined with the universal adoption of zealotry as the marching orders of practitioners and prosecutors, transforms the moral mission of the legal system from one of truth-seeking, storytelling, and justice, to one of fabrication, distortion, and manipulation in pursuit of victory. these victories, however, make us all losers." - (mission statement american academy for justice through science), olivier wendell holmes, earl warren, thane rosenbaum....i have long argued that paying down the national debt is beneficial for the economy, it keeps interest rates lower than they otherwise would be and frees savings to finance increases in the capital stock, thereby boosting productivity and real incomes....we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt....blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt. - alan greenspan, speech, apr.27,2001, thomas jefferson, letter to samuel kerchevel, jul, 12, 1816, herbert hoover, as quoted in francis x. caranaugh's the truth about the national debt....four rules of leadership in a free legislative body: first, no matter how hard-fought the issue, never get personal. don't say or do anything that may come back to haunt you on another issue, another day.-second, do your homework. you can't lead without knowing what you're talking about-third, the american legislative process is one of give and take. use your power as a leader to persuade, not intimidate.-fourth, be considerate of the needs of your colleagues, even if they're at the bottom of the totem pole....people ask the difference between a leader and a boss. the leader works in the open, and the boss in covert...if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall in the ditch....if your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader. - president george bush, theodore roosevelt, jesus christ, john quincy adams....i believe in angels, the kind heaven sends. i am surrounded by angels, but i call them my best friends....i believe that friends are quiet angels who sit on our shoulders and lift our wings when we forget how to fly....you have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence...we all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everywhere....friends are the most important part of your life. treasure the tears, treasure the laughter, but most importantly, treasure the memories. - psalms 16: 11, tim mcgraw, dave brenner...to take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, & the fruits acquired by it.....a large family and democrats have a lot in common: teenagers and democrats are always happy spending other people's money....borrowing and spending is not the way to prosperity....after the $700 billion bailout, the trillion-dollar stimulus, and the massive budget bill with over 9,000 earmarks, many of you implored washington to please stop spending money we don't have. but, instead of cutting, we saw an unprecedented explosion of government spending and debt, unlike anything we have seen in the history of our country....deficits mean future tax increases, pure and simple. deficit spending should be viewed as a tax on future generations, and politicians who create deficits should be exposed as tax hikers....government is taking 40 percent of the gdp. and that's at the state, local and federal level. president obama has taken government spending at the federal level from 20 percent to 25 percent. look, at some point, you cease being a free economy, and you become a government economy. and we've got to stop that. - thomas jefferson, anne northrup, paul ryan, michele bachman, ron paul, mitt romney....i believe in angels, the kind heaven sends. i am surrounded by angels, but i call them my best friends....a government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away....the government, which was designed for the people, has got into the hands of the bosses and their employers, the special interests. an invisible empire has been set up above the forms of democracy....giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys....it might be more worthwhile if we stopped wringing our hands and started ringing our congressmen....if people behaved like governments, you'd call the cops. barry goldwater, woodrow wilson, p.j. o'rourke, author unknown, kelvin throop.....as the president reviewed the state of the union and unveiled his second-term agenda, he fell short of adequately explaining how he intends to set america back on the course of fiscal responsibility and secure the fiscal health of the nation....i would like to see this group in this congress be starting the process to get ourselves on long term fiscal strong footing....sadly, the president's budget proposal for the upcoming year once again puts cutting taxes for the wealthiest americans over addressing our country's severe fiscal problems...the american people expect more from congress. they expect fiscal responsibility and common sense. they expect us to return to the pay-as-you-go budget rules that we had enacted in the past that helped us establish a surplus, however briefly....the american people know what's necessary to get this economy moving again. it's fiscal discipline in washington, d.c. and across-the-board tax relief for working families, small businesses and family farms....our debt is out of control. what was a fiscal challenge is now a fiscal crisis. we cannot deny it; instead we must, as americans, confront it responsibly. and that is exactly what republicans pledge to do. - ron kind, ben quayle, carl levin, melissa bean, mike pence, paul ryan....another good thing about being poor is that when you are seventy your children will not have declared you legally insane in order to gain control of your estate....the mother of revolution and crime is poverty....the say it is better to be poor and happy than rich and miserable, but how about a compromise like moderately rich and just moody....i worked my way up from nothing to a state of extreme poverty....it is a tragic mix-up when the united states spends $500,000 for every enemy soldier killed and only $53 annually on the victims of poverty. - woody allen, aristotle, princess diana, groucho marx, martin luther king, jr.....the senses deceive from time to time, and it is prudent never to trust wholly those who have deceived us even once...trust, but verify....when a man assumes a public trust he should consider himself a public property....let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent....there is danger from all men. the only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty...trust yourself. create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement. - rene descartes, ronald reagan, thomas jefferson, william shakespear, john adams, golda meir....is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?  forbid it, almighty god!  i know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death....god is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.  therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea....but if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does god's love abide in him....maybe the atheist cannot find god for the same reason a thief cannot find a policeman! - patrick henry, john 3:17, psalm 42:1-2...the american people are screaming at the top of their lungs to washington, 'stop! stop the spending, stop the job-killing policies.' and yet, democrats in washington refuse to listen to the american people....getting and spending, we lay waste our powers....as i have traveled throughout my congressional district, the one thing i heard loud and clear was simply please stop spending money you do not have, rein in spending, live within a budget...that's the real secret to job creation - not borrowing and spending more money in washington....today is the day for the complaining to end and for statesmanship to begin. today i am taking action to cut state spending and balance the budget this year. - michele bachmann, john boehner, william wordsworth, tim scott, paul ryan, chris christie....true class by a us president and his wife now @ the little guy fights back for you....and see the most amazing patriotic american automobile every constructed for memorial day now @ the little guy fights back for you.... all men are created equal, it is only men themselves who place themselves above equality....do not call for black power or green power. call for brain power....equality is the soul of liberty; there is, in fact, no liberty without it....fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal....from the equality of rights, springs identity of our highest interests, you cannot subvert your neighbor's rights without striking a dangerous blow at your own....before god we are all equally wise - and equally foolish. - david allan coe, barbara jordon, frances wright, abraham lincoln, carl schurz, albert einstein....goodness is the only investment that never fails....the highest wisdom is loving kindness....do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, to all the souls you can, in every place you can, at all the times you can, with all the zeal you can, as long as ever you can....true religion is real living, living with all one's soul, with all one's goodness and righteousness....the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control...goodness is love in action, love with its hand to the plow, love with the burden on its back, love following his footsteps who went about continually doing good. - henry david thoreau, talmud (original old testament), john wesley, albert einstein, bible (galatians 5:22), james hamilton....politics is supposed to be the second-oldest profession. i have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first...politics, it seems to me, for years, or all too long, has been concerned with right or left instead of right or wrong....we'd all like to vote for the best man, but he's never a candidate....under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule - and both commonly succeed, and are right....politicians are the same all over. they promise to build a bridge even where there is no river....politics is the art of looking for trouble, find it whether it exists or not, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedy....politicians say they're beefing up our economy. most don't know beef from pork....all of us who are concerned for peace and triumph of reason and justice must be keenly aware how small an influence reason and honest good will exert upon events in the political field....if god wanted us to vote, he would have given us candidates.~ ronald reagan, richard armour, frank mckinney, h.l. menchken, nikita khrushchev, ernest benn, albert einstein, jay leno....not considering good or bad the democrats have demonstrated that in our era, they are the party which kicks the important issues which face our republic down the road like a can, to be faced by a day of reckoning....a democrat is just like a baby. if it's hollering and making a lot of noise, there is nothing serious the matter with it. when it's quiet and doesn't pay much attention to anything, that's when it's really dangerous....democrats can't get elected unless things get worse-and things won't get worse unless they get elected....democrats are the only reason to vote for republicans....republicans believe every day is the fourth of july, but the democrats believe every day is april 15. - little guy, will rogers, jeane j. kirkpatrick, will rogers, ronald reagan....i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood....when we really begin to live in the world, then we understand what is meant by brotherhood or mankind and not before....the universal brotherhood of man is our most precious possession, what there is of it....surely the day will come when color means nothing more than the skin tone, when religion is seen uniquely as a way to speak one's soul: when birth places have the weight of a throw of the dice and all men are born free, when understanding breeds love and brotherhood....if there is love, there is hope to have real families, real brotherhood, real equanimity, real peace. if the love within your mind is lost, if you continue to see other beings as enemies, then no matter how much knowledge or education you have, no matter how much material progress is made, only suffering and confusion will ensue....if you really believe in brotherhood of man, and you want to come into its fold, you've got to let everyone else in too. - martin luther king jr., swami vivekananda, mark twain, josephine baker, dalai lama, oscar hammerstein ii....there is one sure way of telling when politicians aren't telling the truth - their lips move....what this country needs if more unemployed politicians....politicians are people who, when they see light at the end of the tunnel, go out and buy some more tunnel....the magician and the politician have much in common; they both have to draw our attention away from what they are really doing....washington is a place where politicians don't know which way is up and taxes don't know which way is down....my definition of a redundancy is an air-bag in a politician's car. - felicity kendall, edward langley, john quinton, ben okri, robert oben, larry hagman....wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. it is the spirit of the men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory....we make war that we may live in peace....those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace and those who could make a good peace would never have won the war....there was never a good war or a bad peace....i dream of giving birth to a child who will ask, "mother, what was war?" - general george s. patton, aristotle, winston churchill, eve merriam....half a truth is often a great lie....all truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them....chase after truth like hell and you'll free yourself, even though you never touch its coat tails....there is not a truth existing which i fear...or would wish unknown to the world....if you shut up truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow, and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts through it will blow up everything in its way. - benjamin franklin, galileo, clarence darrow, thomas jefferson, emile zola...democracy arose from men's thinking that if they are equal in any respect, they are equal absolutely....the best principles of our republic secure to all its citizens a perfect equality of rights....i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character....before god we are equally wise and equally foolish....we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. - aristotle, thomas jefferson, martin luther king jr., albert einstein, thomas jefferson....god invented forgiving as a remedy for a past that not even he could change and not even he could forget. his way of forgiving is the model for our forgiving....the weak can never forgive. forgiveness is the attribute of the strong...and...if there is any kindness i can show, or any good thing i can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as i shall not pass this way again. lewis b smedes, gandhi, pennsylvania founder-william penn....the impersonal hand of government can never replace the helping hand of a neighbor....i nod to a passing stranger, and the stranger nods back, and two human beings go off, feeling a little less anonymous....man is now able to soar into outer space and reach up to the moon; but he is not moral enough to live at peace with his neighbor....there are nine requisites for contented living; health enough to make work a pleasure; wealth enough to support your needs; strength enough to battle with difficulties and forsake them; grace enough to confess your sins and overcome them; patience enough to toil until some good is accomplished; charity enough to see some good in your neighbor; love enough to move you to be useful and helpful to others; faith enough to make real the things of god; hope enough to remove all anxieous fears concerning the future....a man is called selfish not for pursuing his own good, but for neglecting his neighbor's. - hubert h. humphrey, robert brault, sri sathy sai baba, johann wolfgang von goethe, richard whately....the opportunity for brotherhood presents itself every time you meet a human being....above all things let us never forget that mankind constitutes one great brotherhood; all born to encounter suffering and sorrow, and therefore bound to sympathize with each other....i refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality. i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word,,,,love the lord your god with all your passion and prayer and intelligence. love others as well as you love yourself - jane wyman, albert pike, martin luther king jr., jesus christ....2010: just as treasures are uncovered from the earth, so virtue appears from good deeds, and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind. to walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue... no man is great e
