 âi have an old piano that hasn't been tuned in yearsâ.
so... you have just inherited your grandmother's piano or you found a piano on-line but you aren't really sure how long ago it's been since it was tuned. chances are it is going to need more  than a simple tuning. pianos that are left for years without service will invariably drop in pitch as the string tension slowly releases over years. you as the piano owner may have to decide whether it is worth the extra effort and possible expense to bring your piano back to life...     more








i'm interested in buying a piano, but where do i start?...
the first thing to establish is whether you are looking for a new or used instrument. the budget is often the deciding factor for many people. for most upright pianos the dividing line between new and used will be around $4500. you might find something on sale for that price but that will be the low end of the price range. if you are in the market for a new grand piano you can count on paying above $12,000 for an entry level instrument.  the top end of the grand piano price range will be quite a bit more than a luxury car. the used piano market offers the opportunity to get an instrument for considerably less but finding a good used piano is quite a bit more complicated...     more










         frequently asked questions



  how often should i tune my piano?

a properly maintained piano should be tuned at least once a year. if  humidity is not well controlled it may require two or more tunings. pianos that are used for performances or recording sessions will          usually be tuned before each event.

 how long does it take to tune a piano?

it will usually take somewhere around an hour and 15 minutes to an hour and a half to tune a well maintained piano that has been serviced on a regular basis. if a piano has been left for a number of years between tunings it may take an hour and a half to two hours to complete the tuning. a neglected piano takes more time because the tuner has  to go back over the tuning a number of times to get the instrument to settle and have the tuning stay in place. there is also more time spent assessing the instrument, diagnosing problems and applying techniques to avoid string breakage which is often a problem with pianos that have been allowed to sit for years without tuning.



 why do pianos go out of tune?

the piano is the most stable stringed instrument ever made but it is still a stringed instrument and all stringed instruments need to be tuned. most stringed instruments like guitars and violins will need to be tuned every time they are played but a piano is made with a heavy wooden framework and a cast iron plate that make it far more stable than other stringed instruments. however, over time humidity fluctuations will cause the wooden soundboard, bridges and back posts to swell or shrink which will cause the string tension and pitch of strings to fluctuate with them causing the piano to go out of tune. a lot of heavy play can also cause the strings to slip in tension and go out. even without play a piano will eventually go out of tune as string tension slowly drops allowing a piano to go flat. 
 what is concert pitch?
 a440 is the international standard for pitch for the tuning of  musical instruments . the term a440 refers to the number of times per  second that the a above middle c vibrates  when tuned to concert pitch. the vast majority of musical instruments in the world are designed to be at concert pitch and almost all recorded music since the invention of recording devices has be recorded at concert pitch. (there are a few exceptions as some symphony orchestras may tune slightly higher to a442 and recently a small number of musicians have been  promoting a432). if a piano has been neglected and left for years without tuning, string tension will have dropped and the instrument could be far below pitch making unable to be used for playing along with recorded music or other instruments that can't be tuned. bringing a neglected piano back to concert pitch  can often require more than one tuning. 

 


 how long should i wait to tune a piano after moving it?
most people have heard that a piano will go out of tune if it is moved . it certainly may be true that pushing a piano up and down stairs, loading it onto at truck and shaking it up driving through traffic will leave it more out of tune at the other end than before the move. however, it is the change in humidity from one building to another that is the real reason that it may be wise to wait a few weeks  before tuning. if the difference in humidity conditions from one location to another is  wide then it may be best to wait for up to a month so the soundboard and bridges have had enough time to acclimatise to the new surroundings.  some examples of significant humidity differences might be found when moving a piano from a basement to the ground floor or moving from an air conditioned space to a space where there is no air conditioning.  if, on the other hand your piano is moving to a new space where the humidity will be the same as it was before moving then there is no need  for a waiting period before tuning. 
 how far ahead do i have to call or text to book a tuning?
most customer requests for piano tuning can be met within a week to two weeks and often there are openings available within a few days depending on a customer's location and their own availability during those time slots. fall is the busiest time for most tuners and  schedules tend to get backed up as we get close to christmas. it pays to plan ahead at that time of the year as most tuners will be booked up to the new year by mid november! 



  is my piano worth more because it's an antique?
sadly, pianos don't increase in value as they age. a piano is a very complicated instrument that  requires maintenance and restoration as they age which, often requires significant time and money. most 100 year old pianos will still have all of their original strings and parts.  like an old victorian mansion that still has all of its original wiring, plumbing and decor, it takes a labour of love to upgrade to âlike newâ standards. the cost of restoration prevents antique pianos from being valuable. more
 my piano has sticking keys. is that an expensive repair?
sometimes people will delay servicing their piano because they are aware that there was something more than just tuning involved and  worry that it may be costly. usually a few sticking keys or action parts won't lead to any additional charges as many adjustments will only take a few minutes or even seconds to address once the piano has already been opened up for tuning. generally, my approach is to include adjustment of pedals , lubricating squeaks, tracking down rattles and easing keys in the price of a tuning service call.

              people will often make an appointment to tune a piano because something is  squeaking,  rattling, sticking or  not playing at all. it's a good idea to combine the repair with a tuning rather than pay for a separate service call. often these small repairs only take a few minutes to remedy when the piano is already opened  for tuning. it's always best to mention any additional problems with your piano when booking a tuning so some extra time can be time can be allotted  to address the problem.
some of the most common small repairs are sticking keys, broken action parts, missing or cracked keytops, pedal problems and broken strings. most of these can be addressed during a tuning appointment.  i carry an inventory of hundreds of parts with me on all tuning visits so i am able to remedy most common repair issues on a single visit. of course, not all repair issues are small. some pianos may need more extensive work. i will only recommend more extensive restoration if i feel your piano is worth the investment.     more on repairs...

restoration services
hammer replacement
often as a piano ages, the hammer felt packs down , the hammers flatten out and a piano can become excessively bright and metallic sounding. these hammers can be improved with reshaping and voicing but often replacement is a better option for 30 to 40 year old hammers.
restringing 
most pianos will never have their original strings replaced . however, a high quality instrument over 40 years old can be improved significantly but replacing the old dull and brittle strings with new strings. this is particularly noticeable in the bass section where the wound strings can become dull and âthumpyâ  sounding.
action restoration
action regulation can often bring new life back to an older instrument but some piano actions are worn to the point where they are noisy or feel excessively light and uncontrollable and may need new centre pins, bushing felt or even new action parts to restore touch and responsiveness  comparable to a new piano. this kind of restoration is usually reserved for valuable instruments that warrant the investment.
key bushing replacement
replacing the felt bushings on a set of keys restores a firm solid feel to the keyboard
key top replacement
replacing a whole set of key tops with new is often preferable to replacing missing or chipped key coverings especially when there are many to be replaced or the original keys have yellowed  significantly.
