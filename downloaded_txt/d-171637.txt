topics and speakers have been chosen carefully to provide nti participants with a high-quality learning experience related to promoting the social and emotional competence of young children, addressing challenging behavior, improving systems and practices and building systems of care. the conference offers both in-depth training workshops and shorter tool-kit sessions.
