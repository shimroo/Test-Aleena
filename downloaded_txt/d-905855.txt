																	birds stuck in vents															

birds in vents in houston are some of the common problems that may be found in homes, especially those in the eastern seaboard. these birds will most likely try to get into some of your vents during the latter part of march to create a new home in those vents. one of the common vents the birds would usually try to get themselves into are the kitchen vents and higher up bathrooms. they may also be found in the dryer vents and lower ground vents used to exhaust gas. they would usually come into these vents to nest and create a home. if they are allowed to nest in these pipes, they could do some serious damage.   

these birds would most likely come into these vents to protect themselves from the elements and protect themselves from predators. the vents are an attractive place for birds to nest in as the temperature in these vents are perfect for birds. without, proper care and maintenance these birds would stay in your vents for about eight weeks and lay eggs everywhere. if you just leave the alone, they will stay there forever and even attract more birds to come and nest in your vents. that is very dangerous as it could pose some serious problems to your house.   
one of the problems that may occur from the birds nesting in your pipes are the potential illnesses and bacteria they carry. birds are not one of the most sanitary animals and who knows where they have come from or where they nested last. they could be carrying lice or mites that would potentially enter your house because the birds are nesting in your vents. those insects and bacteria could easily enter the living spaces in your house and pose serious health hazards to the people living in the house.   
another problem that may affect your household due to the birds is the air ventilation. their nests would most probably block the airflow of the air in the vents. this would be a problem for the air circulating in the house because the air cannot properly flow due to the clogs in the vents. not only is the air circulation in danger but the vents itself. the birds may damage the vents and cause them to break due to their scratching and constant movement in the vents. this would result in more payments coming out of your pocket to fix the damages.  
one way to spot that birds have infiltrated your vents is the foul smell in your house. if you sense a foul odor in the house, checking the vents for bird may be the best thing to do as it would usually be the problem. another way to check is if you hear unusual sounds coming from nowhere that sound close to scratching coming from your vents. their movement and scratching coming from the vents are usually a sign of birds in the vents. truly, birds in vents would pose a series of headaches for you if you allow them to nest in your vents.
