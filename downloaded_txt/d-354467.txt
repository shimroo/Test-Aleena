fundamental theories of ethnic conflict, by muli wa kyendo (ed.)
description
this book develops and expands on theories that aim at explaining the root causes of ethnic and racial conflicts. the aim is to shift focus from research, policies and strategies based on tackling the effects of ethnic and racial conflicts, which have so far been ineffective as evidenced by the increase in ethnic conflicts, to more fundamental ideas, models and strategies. contents extend across many disciplines including evolution, biology, religion, communication, mythology and even introspective perspectives.around the world.



 in love and in war, a tale of tough decisions by henry onyema
what happens when a young white nonconformist woman struggling with her millionaire father's heartbroken rejection finds love in the arms of a young black man who is convinced he is destined to be a killer of men? >what happens when love is threatened by a bloody civil war that calls for total commitment? and what happens when a woman calmly embraces death to have a child even when the best doctors have told her to forgo childbearing ? with her man totally engulfed in a tragic war? find the answers to these questions in the moving story of love between daniel, a nigerian, and nora, an englishwoman, set in the 1960s during the declaration of biafra and the subsequent nigerian civil war. in love and in war, a tale of tough decisions. a first novel by henry chukwuemeka onyemato get your copy, email the author at henrykd2009@yahoo.com or reach him on facebook at www.facebook.com/henrychkwuemeka.onyema

new from cookcomm
about peace and peacemakingâ by maria cristina azcona and others 

    the existence of humnanity  is in peril. its worst enemy is not only violence, war or terrorism, but also a profound lack of love, sensibility and empathy. a complete change for all of us is possible, but only will arrive from an innovative thought and a serious research on the possible ways out. let us find the cure to this severe illness that is causing the decadence and perhaps death of our blue planet earth. (featuring articles by ada aharoni, ernesto kahan , susana roberts, evelin lindner, harold becker , tholana ashok chakravarthy, guy crequie, stephen gill , ammar banni  and  latinamerican authors)
