|the scientist-coldplay]                  life likes to overwhelm us at the times when we really don't need to be overwhelmed. however, whether we like it or not, it happens and we have to dela with it the best way we know how. over the past month it's been hard for me to process a day without wanting to scream at the top of my lungs that this isn't what i signed up for. i signed up for 17 credits that were supposed to enlighten me and challenge me, but not to the point of insanity. i signed up to be treasurer of an organization, not just a name to an officer position and text on a line on a web-site. i signed up for two jobs to help me monitarily. never was this semester supposed to force me to call into question my strength as a student and as a 20-something growing up and as an intellectual. never was this semester supposed to expose me to the evils of laziness in the form of an adjunct professor. i have found in the past month that i was this semesters lesson and i had to learn. as gram once said about life, "i always believed that god gave crosses to those he thought could bear the weight, and that is how i have lived my life".                   speaking of gram, she passes away march 2nd. interestingly enough her brother passed away 5 days before she did. when she was being taken back to her room moments before her heart attack the nurses said that she had opened her arms as if someone was hugging her. i like to think that uncle angelo came for her. it's a solace to an ever present emptiness that will never be filled. of course i have plenty of family and friends who are always with me, but just as no one can replace them, there's nothing like my gram. this is the woman who during the depression had one pair of socks, rinsed them out everynight and  wore them the next day. no one ever knew that they were the same pair. "poor, yes, dirty no...because soap and water are cheap". this is the same woman who cared so much about her hair that she walked two blocks on a broken ankle so that she wouldn't be late for her hair appointment. i have the family i have because of this woman and her strong family ideology. she lived for the happiness of her children and her grandchildren and her lone great-grandchild. the joy she had just from watching that boy devour 3 bowls of her homemade chicken soup was one only she could have. the day she went to the hospital, as sick as she was, she made that soup and watched him eat every drop of it. even better was, "ashley, you're so skinny, have something with your tea." i would normally reply, "gram i just want my tea, honestly i'm fine"...about 5 seconds later there were a good 4 chips ahoy cookies on a plate in front of me where she would proceed to say, "here, have some nice cookies". pineapple upside down cake, the soup, the christmas and easter kielbasa, the lasagna, the tea that i have drunk since i was 3 years old is because of this woman. even little things like (this is maria's favorite) on greeting cards our names always had quotations around them. why? good question, you'll have to ask her. i have a lot of grieving to do that i can't even begin to get to until after this semester. i really miss her and it's only been three weeks. as selfish as it may seem i kinda knew she wasn't going to see me graduate law school, but i was really hoping to show her my temple diploma. even more ridiculous, is that i really wanted her to be at my wedding (as long as this is, in a galaxy far far away from here). and i know that i had so many times with her, and i took her to lunch, and i went over every sunday, and i cleaned the house for her when she was sick, i still wish that she had lasted the summer. go to chaplin's, perkin's, maybe the mall if she needed anything. and i know i'm being stupid, and i don't care if i sound like a brat who doesn't get that she isn't coming back. if i didn't feel this way, than that would have meant that i didn't care at all. i'm frustrated that i can't let go, and i know i'm not ok, and i don't know when i will be ok. but hopefully she'll help me...somehow...

|nobody's home-avril lavigne]so, how do we like this as a fan-fucking-tastic start to a day...         you wake up, feeling jsut as exhausted as you did when you went to sleep, but you get up anyways since you know you have to read anton chekov's the cherry orchard. fine...you get up, you make your cup of tea, you sit and you start to read.         one act down, 3 to go, but you need to go to your 8:40 class. you get up, pick up your thomas kinkade mug, proceed to place the mug in the sink....oh shit you fumble....you think you recover, but a split second later you watch your mug hit the ground with that awful "i'm ceramic breaking" sound and watch it shatter all over your kitchen floor.        what did i do? i went back over to my seat put my head on the counter and cried....         i'm tired...i need a break....i need to stop for one day and remember what it's like to not walk as if my legs had a mind of their own. i need to remember what it was like to take a shower and not make a list in my head of everything i have yet to do in my day. i would love to go to bed, and not feel like my head was impaled into my pillow b/c i'm so tired. i want to clean my apartment and not say, "you shouldn't be doing this, you should be at your desk working". furthermore i don't want to feel bad for taking a 10 minute break so i can eat. no one should ever have to feel the way that i feel now....no one should ever have to feel bad for taking care of themselves the way one should. finally, no one should feel so tired that when talking to someone they truly care about more than anything else they fall asleep. there is no reason for that....        i'm a broken record....my piano strings need tuning....my life needs to be changed....but that's not going to happen, at least until the next week is over... i'm in a depressing state of affairs...

|morning after-howie day]sooooo....       there are approximately 9 school days, one mock trial tournament, and one debate tournament left til spring break...and god it can't get here soon enough. i'm constantly tired and a slave to the 14 million calenders that i own (wall calender, purse planner, and the larger planner in my bookbag). i've got 2 italian compositions due, along with a kimmika paper, and an art paper (which actually won't be that hard). i need to go over my mock trial stuff, and i need to pick out a menu for the tournament next week. next week i'm supposed to have another theory quiz but we'll see if we're actually going to have that or not, and then i have 2 mid-terms and an italian test to cap off the end of my week. sounds fantastic doesn't it? riiiiiight...        i'm exhausted. i feel like i've got nothing left in me to get through the rest of the semester. not to mention the horrible fact that in order to get through kimmika's class (which i need to pass with a c or better in order to graduate with a theater minor) i need to come up w/ a 10-30 minute production in the realm of expressionism, plus a 10 page paper on the genre itself and our rehearsal process. caitlin grogan and i have nothing. we have the worst genre out of anybody. i would rather to opera than this. not to mention the other awful fact that my current gpa ia a 3.74 (cumulative). the past two semesters i have pulled at least a 3.8 as a semester cum. i guess everything else is going well when it comes down to it but i'm freaking out. what happens if i don't pull the same semester that i have been pulling? it will be like the past two semesters of work have meant nothing. i know i'm doing well in my theory class. furthermore, my art class is also going well. i have seen all the shows i needed to go and see thus far, and i did pretty well on our first quiz. i'm doing well in political philosophy, but i'll have a better idea tomorrow when i get my plato paper back. american political thought i'm doing well in but i don't have any grades yet. we only have 2 tests (mid and final) and a paper that's not due til after spring break).  however i participate in class so i'm not worried about it. kimmika has to give us our papers back on oedipus, and on ghosts, and i have a b+ on the one quiz that she gave us. and as per my norm i participate like it's my job. we went to the opera this week as well. very good by very long. so guess if i can j/ keep up this voracious pace than i should be ok. but i don't exactly know how long i'm going to be able to do that. i don't eat well and i know it. there's j/ sometimes where i'm so tired i don't feel like leaving 1300 to go to the sac and get something to eat. even when i do go, there's crap there. i hate being a slave to the meal plan. furthermore, i don't dress up....ever. i mean i'm in a hoodie almost everyday. partly b/c it's so cold out that the things that i normally would wear are just not warm enough. i don't go out, unless it's a social for phi alpha delta. going to the gym w/ em and the girls? non-existant. i have nooooooo life. it's an endless array of due dates and essays and readings and homework. then there's the organizations and the jobs which just take up time. but i can't live here w/o cash. it just doesn't work. i barely even have time to do dishes. i would just looooove to skip class, and everything for just one day, and clean the apartment, go through my drawers (which are a travesty ps) and just get my life in order. maybe i will actually do that this week. just stop the world for a day getting stuff done...       i miss peter so much that words do do my emotions justice. we fell asleep on the phone....both of us did. that's another thing i'm tried of...missing peter. if i get bored in a class, instead of thinking about the 14 million other things that i have to do that day then i think of him, and spring break, or i'll simply reminisce about the summer. summer! he figured out that he only needs to pick up 6 credits...meaning that he will either a) take 2 courses at mansfield over the summer, or b) come home and j/ take two online courses and do the work that he needs to do at home. he hasn't decided yet what he's gonna do, but that perks up the summer months bit. we'll see though.      i guess all in all life isn't too bad....just insanely busy, organized, and unorganized all at the same time (if that is possible). school is school, me and peter are me and peter, and my applications are coming along. i j/ need to acquire one more recommendation (which i'm just thinking about asking conrad weiler, since he did give me an a in supreme court last semester), and i just need to know some variable info. for the paper application. my honors app is finished, i j/ need to complete the two essays. resume is done and i asked sheila paulos to do my recommendation and she graciously accepted. so over break i'm going to do those essays, hand them in then let sheila know that she can send the recommendation to the honors office and that will be knocked off of the list. like i said...organized and unorganized all at the same time...ashley <3*

no more claddaugh...

[music
|disco-howie day]i lost my claddaugh ring today...           i was about to get ready for bed and then work on my italian homework. my rings don't change much. i have my thumb ring, my ae fern ring, my high school grad ring, and then on my left hand i have my claddaugh ring. i have three rings accounted for, and the fourth one is mia. the claddaugh is an irish symbol the represents love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the  crown). i bought my ring when i was in ireland. it was 13 euro so that's about 15 american dollars, so it's not like it was expensive or anything. however, the cost is not the point, and of course i can always replace it since they are sold in the us. however, i bought this ring in the country from which it originated, on a trip with my debate team members that i will never take again, when all i could think about was going home to see my family and of course peter, who was basically represented when i wore that ring. if you wear the ring with the tip of the heart facing inward than that means your heart is taken, and that is how i always wore it (even though we technically weren't a couple until after i arrived back in the states. this ring takes me on such a sentimental journey that i don't even know where to begin. i really want to cry just thinking about it. i don't want to replace it, i want to find it, although i know that chances of that happening are slim to none at best. granted i still have many other nice things to remind me of ireland, like the poster i bought at trinity college, the postcards of ireland, pictures and the claddaugh pill box i got that is made of sea minerals. but every morning when i put on my ring it was a reminder of dublin, my trip, and of peter. unless i find this ring (which chances are that i won't) than i will no longer have that trifold reminder...        well i'm going to go to sleep, and before i do go sleep i am going to say a prayer to st. anthony-> the patron st. of lost things...and hopefully my ring will turn up...<3* ashley

|anna nalick - in the rough]it's been one of those weeks i guess...            my weekend was fantastic. peter came to temple on saturday afternoon and left on sunday afternoon. i was so glad to see him and we had such a great time. we hung out at my apartment for a bit and then we were going to go to the draught horse for dinner. we got there, and it was closed (despite the cute little sign that said "saturday- 4-?"). in any even we went to maxi's for dinner and that was good. the food was quite good and it wasn't too crowded so i enjoyed it and so didn't peter. we went back to 1300 when we went to see emily and the girls on the 3rd floor. we didn't stay there for very long, just long enough to say hello, make some intros and that be that. we went back upstairs and hung out here. we went to bed and all was well. =o)            sunday was just a relaxing day. peter and i had tea and cereal for breakfast, followed by the traditional college lunch of ramen noodles and capri sun. after that, he had to catch the 2:29 train. i didn't want him to go at all, and i know he didn't want to leave either. i don't even care how muchy it sounds but i miss him so much and it sucks. a lot. however that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger so, 11 more weeks to go til the summer. then again that's a story in and of itself as well...           after racing to the train station and just making the 2:29 r5 to lansdale and sulking for about 2 hours like the pathetic loser that i was and still am, i did the dishes and started to get ready for emily's superbowl party. that would be the point at which my father calls to let me know that my grandmother was admitted to the hospital for a really bad cough (backround: my grandmother is set to have surgery on wed, as in tomorrow, to have what's called renkers diverticulum removed from the side of her esophogus-this cough is in direct relation w/ her surgery). so that was some pretty sweet news. luckily she was cleared by pulminary for a second time today so the surgery will continue as planned. steelers won the superbowl (ps> i couldn't car less...sorry...) and i then proceeded back to my room to study for my italian test. i then got into bed, and that concludes the weekend.           kinda wish i did better on the italian test, but i guess i did ok. i did a lot of errands on monday. dropped off the lease for my apartment for next year, stoppe at the student activities office for debate stuff, interviewed for the social chair position for phi alpha delta, made some arrangements for the weekend, and finally went to work. work was going well-> i wrote a paper and started to read aristotle for political philosophy. then i got a call from lisa. the second person to pass away from my graduation class is jimmy brozetti. he was in a car accident, and the front end caught fire. i hope he died on impact, because i would hate the idea of him burning to death. impact is at least quick. needless to say i didn't get any more work done. i kept waking up in the middle of the might and j/ kept thinking about it. i think the worst part is that i don't really feel anything. i mean i feel bad that he died but i didn't really know jimmy to be perfectly honest. maybe a hi in the halls, i did have a conversation w/ him once at riccardo's (which ps was real random), and he congratulated me after graduation. other than that, nothing. i keep telling myself, "ashley, you didn't know him, he was in essence someone you graduated high school with, nothing more," but i just feel terrible not feeling really anything about it. don't get me wrong i am depressed to hear that a classmate of mine who was only 20 years old is no longer here, that is a very extreme loss. but after that, i've got nothing. even though i know i didn't really know him, i still feel like that's a terrible thing to say or a terrible way to feel. i had so much work to catch up on that i skipped 2 classes today, and thank god i did. i needed to type up my kimmika essay and i needed to read a play. we ended up having a quiz on it so i am really glad that worked out. although now i have to make up a shit load of aristotle which blows.          i have an interesting peter update. he's taking not classes for just one, but two summer sessions beginning in may. this is going to put somewhat of a damper on summer, but i know this is something that he has to do in order to maintain jr. status (backround-changed the major, things got screwed up, needs more credits...ok so that was reader's digest haha). plus i know how much i reaaaaaaally want to graduate in 4 years, so if this enables us to finish undergrad together and on time, than fine. he has to do what he has to do. plus, at least now i'll be home so he can come home to see me, and it will be much easier. i would love to say that i would go and see him...but if you saw my metal that i try to call a motorvehicle...than you would understand my hesitancy. other than that all is well, and i intend to keep it that way for a long long time. except i miss him, but we already know that <3          tomorrow is a nice and easy day, but i do have some meetings and errands that need to get done. now it is time for a shower and an early bed time, since last night was completely ruined. g'night all...<3ashleyps> spring break, t-3 weeks and 3 days....oh yes, it's on <3

|come clean - hilary duff]well, it's been so long since i have given an update i don't even think i remember what i wrote last! so i guess i'll give a reader's digest of life since about thanksgiving...
          so i went home for thanksgiving after blowing about $250 on presents for my aunt mar, uncle john, stephen and maria and maria's b-day present (had to be born dec. 6th). the break was ok w/ a meltdown of sorts between amy and myself. thanksgiving break is always quite stressful b/c it's supposed to be a break but noever usually ends up happening that way. peter and i spent some quality time together the last day of break and it was fantastic. we had the this cute little thing going (but not really) where we didn't really say a lot of the things we felt to make it "easier"...yeah...cause that worked out reaaaaaal well. that definately got taken care of over thanksgiving, and i think both of us were relieved to go back to school for the last two weeks since life had worked itself out.
        the semester ended and finals were completed. our phi alpha delta party was unbelievable. i hadn't had such a good time at a party in such a long time. i hope we have another one at the end of this semester because it would be another really great time. i went home and then went directly to peter's house. he left for florida the next day for his christmas holiday. we had such a great time together, but we knew that not being able to see each other until after the new year was going to suck. he left for florida and i went home, but with a renewed faith the eventually things would work themselves out (as they always have a habit of doing).
        so christmas came and i received a lot of nice things. the next day i went to dublin, ireland for the world universities debating championships. it was definately a learning experience being that we got our asses kicked since we didn't know the style of debate, but we met a lot of really great people from around the world so it was fun in that sense. dublin itself was a great place and i got a lot of nice things to take back with me. the sites were fun, especially grafton street (shopping), the temple bar area which is a street of bars and shops that are on the historical side, trinity college, the book of kells, the long room at trinity, dublin castle, and st. stephen's green j/ to name a few. as much fun as i did have i was definately ready to come home. the phone cards were ridiculous so talking to family and peter was extremely difficult. as long as i can talk to people at home i am pretty cool with being away from home. but cut me off and put me across the atlantic ocean and houston we have a problem. i missed my house, my family, my bed (the hotel beds were the worst) and peter, oh my god, it was nearly pathetic. i would chastize myself saying, "ashley, get it together, you have 3 days left! get a freakin grip!". i seriously appreciate being from the us after 8 days in ireland. the minute i got home i was just so glad to be home. peter and i went out to dinner that night and i had baby back ribs-> a truly american meal. about 2 days after i got back we became "official" i guess you can say...although i know for a fact that peter hates that label. that being said it was time. we don't want to be with anybody else, we're not looking for anything else, and we've gotten past the point of, "is this going to ruin us?". when you're given the gift that we have been given you have to accept it for what it is. that's what life is all about. you reach a point where you can no longer ignore what is right in front of you, and that's what our relationship evolved into. we didn't make it that way, it grew into that, and that's why we are the way we are. i must admit, it's new for me to be relaxed and confident about a relationship...but it's an amazing feeling to finally have =o).
         soooooooooo after a week of spending tons of time with peter, and trying my damndest to stay awake for it for reasons that shall not be mentioned, it was finally time to go back to school. we've been back to school for about a week and i'm feeling good about this semester. i've been to the gym twice with emily and her suite-mates and then out to dinner. i've gone to all my classes and there's going to be work but i'm excited about it all the same. i had a great last semester finishing with a 3.88 gpa so i need to keep up the anti. debate and phi alpha delta start back up this week upcoming and i'll be in full swing w/ my work schedule at the ibc and costumes. i still have some little errands here and there to take care of but i've got a good handle on them so i'm in a really good place right now and that's comforting to know and to feel. well i'm gonna go since erin brockovitch is coming on!! but i'll try to be better w/ keeping up...although you know how that goes haha.

|you get me - michelle branch]       ever pick up one of those weeks where you feel like time has sped up so much that you can't even grasp on to it if you ran? well for me, it's one of those weeks...
       i started off monday just trying to get through the week. monday was fine. tuesday was much of the same. one exception, i took care of the passport situation. yeah, $112 later it got taken care of, but mom dropped $50 in my account to help out with my cause.  anyways, wednesday i had a decently long day, but in the end it was kinda cool...kinda. i had a phi alpha delta meeting and we figured out when we're partying for finals and what not. this will be so0o welcomed at this point in the game. anyways, i went to choir and we got out a 1/2 hour early and it was (as stephen would say) phenomenal, in every sense of the word. i got lunch at the sac and then from there tried to figure out addresses to get money from schools for debate. then i went to my debate meeting and had a good session. next, i came home thinking i could just get some homework done. amy calls and asks if i could get to maggiano's. thinking i would be meeting her i said yeah are you there? and she said no but mike is (backround: mike is amy's ex-boyfriend). so quick got changed and went. i loooooove maggiano's, and he paid, and he was very nice and waited with me in the subway so i wouldn't be by myself. i came home and talked to peter, and then went to bed. thursday we didn't nothing in voice for the actor. ih was good, although i was late haha. criminal justice was good too, we went overe our test, although i don't know my grade yet since we didn't get our written part back yet. then i went to work from 3-6 for the opening of heidi chronicles. after that i came back here and hung out w/ em and stephen. i came back to my room and then saw that peter must have gotten into something at mansfield, although i didn't know what. later he had up on his away message to me that alot was going on and to forgive him for his slightness and closure about some events. 
           i have no problem giving him space if he needs to figure things out, that's not something that he needs to apologize about at all. if he has things that he really doesn't want to talk about with anyone including me, than i can't force him to talk. if he does than he knows exactly where to find me. however, i am worried about him. i am worried that he's putting a lot of pressure upon himself to figure out exactly who he is and what he is about in a short period of time. he has an entire lifetime to figure out those answers. men have made themselves go mad with trying to figure out the bigger picture before they're ready to find out those answers (hence the phrase "i wish that i knew what i know now when i was younger").i'm worried that he's trying to make himself serious about things faster than what he's ready for. he's trying to go through his head and get things in order which is fine, i've found myself trying to do that as well. i guess i just hope that he's not trying to turn himself into a 40 year old in a 20 year old's body. he's got plenty of time for that...plenty of time. i could be completely wrong in my assessment of this entire situation completely, and if i am than i hope that i'll find out what's really going on (eventually). if i'm not wrong, than i can only hope that things get better for him. he's trying so hard to get things in order, and i would hate for things to blow up in his face after giving everything he has to this. 
            friday was nice and easy. worked early from 6:15-8, italian test (not bad), supreme court (also not bad), then a nap. after that i ate lunch, and tried to meet with conrad weiler about my supreme court paper, but he wasn't in the office. then i came back here and took a shower and went to game night. then i went to the "dance concert". you know how little kids figure out how awesome it is to play in a box? well this is what that was, except it was 2 college girls. then i came back here and chilled until i went to bed. didn't talk to peter.
         today i had work and i cleaned. i read while i was at work. i'm gonna do the same thing tomorrow as well. tomorrow i want to finish shopping for "christmas at thanksgiving". i called peter to try to see if he was alive, but he didn't pick up, so i left a voicemail. so now i am going to go to sleep because i am tired. talk to you soon!

|colorblind-counting crows]        so yeah...there's officially 16 more days left of the fall semester....someone wanna tell me how that happened?
        this past month flew by. after getting back here after being home i got a cute sinus cold that last for about a week. i missed a few classes, but since my attendance was really good in the first place it didn't matter much. mid terms were insane. not nearly as bad as my finals from last semester but they were keeing me busy enough. after mid terms were over things started to calm down. peter and i decided that we should just be close friends for right now because we don't see each other when we're at school, and furthermore this sorta kinda not really type of relationship things was just a half ass way of doing things. in retrospect the decision made being at school a bit easier. i stopped thinking about the summer so much (not that i don't think of it fondly) and made weeks go by a lot faster. not to mention the fact that we haven't seen each other since the beginning of october sucked at first but i think now it was something that we really needed to do. we are two seperate people and if we are going to be together in the end than we need to know who we are and what we are about in order to make it work. hard lesson to learn, and one that can be only learned through experience. the decision seems like it was made forever ago but it has only been two weeks. like i said, how timre flies...
         the 2nd through the 6th i was in dc with phi alpha delta for the pre-law conference and mock trial competition. it was so amazing. not only did i get a shit load of helpful info on law school, applications, and actual law schools, i had such a fun time with the people in the frat and other people that were there from other chapters. i met some people from the university of arizona and they were really cool. mike and casper were the two people that i made pretty good friends with from there. i was really surprised how close i got with the people from temple. i was already close with micah since he is on debate with me but others that i hadn't really known at all, like natalie, logan, adam, stephen, and kathy. emily, stephen, and i hung out a lot the last night. wedding crashers (ugh...unbelievable) was the movie most quoted, and after that it was pretty sick how much fun we all had. i was really tired after the conference, but this week flew by even though i thought it was going to be ridiculously long. 
          classes are going well. my two best i would say are italian ( i just got a 100 on my test) and ih (essentially english/crash course on philosophy; just got an a- on my mid-term). supreme court is going well but i'm pissed that i only got a b+ on my paper. i fixed everything he asked me to and i still only got a b+. however, i do have my take home mid-term which should be a great way to boost up my grade. voice is going well, but i don't have any grades in there as of yet, but my attendance is good so i'm not worried about it. criminal justice, i have 2 consecutive b's b/c of those damn multiple choice tests. we had a test this week which i really wanted an a on, but there was a lot more writing, and since there was so much to think about i started forgetting things that i had written down earlier. however i am always in class (i've only missed 2 all semester, one of which was an excused for the conference), and i participate like it's my job. so i'm hoping to weasle out an a- (which is a 3.67 on a 4.0 scale). i guess i don't have a lot to complain about in the grades department, but i always get aggitated when i don't get what i want, especially on papers. i'm not used to b's...i get a's. i guess this is what happens when you're scared to bring home anything less than a 90 for fear of the wrath that is possible from the gestapo...i mean my parents =o).
           debate is going. there's some miscommunication issues but i hope to get them all squared away soon. my fingers are crossed.
           oh well, i'm gonna take a shower, then i'm off to la mia professoressa per la ora del'suo ufficio, then i'm off to work. after that i'm going to spend $97 for the government to say i can leave the country, and then i'm gonna try to go out for once in my life lol. 
ciao! <3 ashley

|grey street - dave matthews band]          so...it's been quite a weekend... actually it's j/ been a hell of a two weeks...
          i have finally got myself into a routine of know what days go with what job, and classes. speaking of which my classes are going better than i thought they were. i thought i screwed myself on my criminal justice true/false test. i hate those types of tests...they try to trick you with words like "every" and "sometimes" and "always". it's like buddy, i don't really give a damn. can you just ask me a question, let me give you the right answer and let me pay my thousands and thousands of dollars on tuition that end up being your salary anyways?? thanks...i appreciate it. back to the real point. he curved the test so i got a b. normally i would be pisted, but since that's only 10% of my grade it doesn't have a whole lot of weight to it. nothing to stress over really. i didn't get my italian test back yet but i know i did well on it. those are the only tests i have taken so far, so otherwise school is good.
         debate is going well. i'm going to dublin from dec. 27th-jan. 4th. i don't know how many tournaments i'm going to go to b/c of out apda-npda transition, but as for now that's fine with me. i love debating don't get me wrong, but it's october and i'm already exhausted. organizationally we're doing well though so i don't really have any complaints.
         phi alpha delta is also going well. rush is over now, and at one of our meetings a woman from temple's law admissions came to go over the admissions process. it was very helpful, so i'm really glad i was at that meeting. i want to do some community service stuff so i can have that on my resume and what not, but i do still have plenty of time so i'm not all that worried about it...yet haha.
         costume shop is busy...we open the musical "company" on thursday so we're trying to get odds and ends done, but it's all good for now. the rec center is just work. i do my shift and that's it, but i already had a paid trainig session and my cpr session so that stuff is keeping me busy. next week i have access training so that i can work the front desk. otherwise it's fine.
        this weekend has been very good and very stressful at the same time. the part that is really stressful i'm not going to divulge, for i don't want to incriminate myself, however it was and still is quite stressful. the weekend was very good though because i went home friday night. amy came into philly and dad came to get us both. pete was home this weekend too, thank god. saturday we went to northern light and then i wanted to go to mass with my mom so he went to the mall. i got back from mass and he hands me ann coulter's "how to talk to a liberal ( if you must)". so great! then we went to his house for dinner with his mom and dad and sister, alex. we picked up this tiramisu cake (ugggghhhh....) and i had to make sure he didn't touch it before dinner (yeah that's right...it's not dessert if you eat it before bitches!). but his mom made aaaaalll this good stuff. shrimp cocktail, stuffed clams, salad, pasta. i was so full. then we attempted to watch national treasure (great movie) but we got sick of that as they were decoding the silence dogood letters (ben franklin; sent them to his uncle's newspaper...nevermind). what ensued was a wonderfully awful conversation about how we go to school quite a distance from each other. i'm so sick and tired of being "realistic" and "logical", but there's really nothing that can be done right now. so for the 15 millionth time i'm going to say that this sucks...a lot. although the conversation sucked (because we kept saying "what are we gonna do" like 20 times in 2 hours) we still had an awesome dinner and just being together was so great. he came with me to my gram's for lunch and that was fun. he left from there. that was about as depressing as a funeral to be blatently honest.i walked back into the house and stef goes hey and i go hey and she goes y'all right? and i'm like ummmm not really but i'm gonna have to be. i don't really have a choice. i went home pretty close after that. then i j/ hung out here. i had work in costumes yesterday and today and i had classes. so i guess alls well that ends well for now...i miss him tho..a lot =o(.
            so that's what a got for now. i'll prolly come back with more in about 2 weeks....or until a certain mansfield sophomore nags me to write again [=o)]. ciao ciao!
