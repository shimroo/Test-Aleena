welcome to
henry neeman's
homepage!








want to know where i am?
check out my
2019 travel schedule,
which includes links to my older travel schedules,
which i care about but no one else seems to. odd, that.





work
curriculum vita

you can have a look at
my
cv.



office



i work at the
university of oklahoma
in
norman,
ok,
where i'm
the
executive director of research computing
and
the director of
the
ou supercomputing center
for education & research (oscer)
—
a division of
ou information technology
—
as well as
an associate professor in the
college of engineering
and
an adjunct associate professor
in the
school of computer science.
my office is
3200 marshall ave suite 130
(just off campus),

but i'm usually elsewhere.






teaching



i've been teaching 
cs 1313,
computer programming for non-majors,
since spring 2000,
though not every semester.
i also taught
cs 2413
in the summer of 2000.




in fall 2003 and summer 2005, i also co-taught
che 5480,

a course that combined nanotechnology and supercomputing.
i taught the supercomputing part (surprise!).




previous work



before working for ou it,
i worked for ou's
center for analysis & prediction
of storms.




before coming to ou,
i was a postdoctoral research associate
(and before that, a graduate research assistant)
working
under
michael
norman
at the
laboratory for computational astrophysics,
which at the time was
part of the
national
center for supercomputing applications
at the
university of illinois
at
urbana-champaign.
mike is now at the
university of california, san diego,
where he's faculty in the
center for astrophysics &
space sciences
as well as
director
of the
san diego supercomputer center.




before ncsa,
i served as a graduate research assistant at the
center for supercomputing research & development,

which is now defunct.





education

i got my phd in uiuc's

department of computer science
in may 1996 (though officially it's recorded as october),
working under advisors
michael
heath,
michael
norman
and
dennis
gannon.
also on my committee were
paul
saylor,
faisal
saied
and
don hearn.
my dissertation title was
"autonomous hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement
for multiscale simulations."

you
can download my dissertation in

postscript
or

pdf
format.




as part of my dissertation,
i developed

hamr,
the hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement system,
which is an autonomous,
general-purpose structured adaptive mesh refinement system
for multiscale simulations
that implements the samr strategy of

marsha berger
--
now a professor of

computer science

at the

courant institute of mathematical sciences

at

new york university
--
and various collaborators.




i also picked up an ms in computer science along the way,
under dennis and don.
my master's thesis was called
"visualization techniques for three-dimensional flow fields,"
and i wrote it while working for dennis at the
center for supercomputing research and development
(now defunct),
just next door to beckman.




before uiuc,
i went to the
university at buffalo,
state university of new york,
where i got a bs in

computer science

and a ba in
statistics
(note: not biostatistics).
(at the time, both were part of the now-defunct
faculty of natural sciences & mathematics,
but now computer science
—
which has become computer science & engineering
—
is in engineering,
and statistics
has become biostatistics
and is
in the school of public health & health professions.
weird.)
while at ub,
i also worked as a programmer,
research assistant and lab teaching assistant
for
the late
beverly
bishop,
a professor of physiology.
i developed software for running experiments in a neurophysiology lab course,
and for conducting research into the relationship
between spatiotemporal movement and motor neuron activity
in human chewing.




personal

i'm married to rebecca (mashburn) neeman.
our first child was born in late 2007.

here's some pictures.
our second child was born in fall 2009.

and still have family there.

there used to be a band in columbus, ohio called
