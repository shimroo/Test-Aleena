regent press is an independent press offering an eclectic mix of titles in a variety of subjects and genres — poetry, fiction, essays, biography, memoir, mythology, history, dance, photography, and visual art, both of an academic and popular nature. regent press was started by mark weiman in 1978, shortly after he arrived in california from philadelphia and manhattan where he had worked in his family’s rare book and scholarly publishing business. the press was initially established and is still located in berkeley, which in many ways is its defining characteristic.
