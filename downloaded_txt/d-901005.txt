 as a department, we are committed to accountability and to action for addressing bias of any kind. because we educate future health care professionals, we recognize our ethical responsibility to educate students to understand and recognize bias, equip them with tools to practice equity, social justice, anti-racism, and to advocate for equity, dignity, caring and fair treatment for all. by upholding these inclusive traits, we are not only able to validate the integrity and professionalism of current and future health care professionals, but also celebrate and address diversity.
