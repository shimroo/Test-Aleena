a message from our founder
"we" was originally me - jeri mesching, teacher, homemaker and an innovative cook who made everything from scratch. in 1986, my children were raised and i decided to fill the void with my second love, cooking. i started east shore with one product, sweet and tangy mustard. the label shows our family home which is on the east shore of a small lake, hence the name east shore specialty foods.










east shore specialty foods offers the most versatile specialty pretzels, gourmet mustards and old fashioned dessert sauces on the market. based on traditional old fashioned recipes and ingredients our specialty foods boast classic tastes that are reminiscent of eating at grandmas while enjoying the contemporary ease of purchasing a pre-made product.
