faqs about our flexfence louver system hardware kits


what is a louver?
the word “louver” is derived from the french word “l’ouvert” or “the open one” and is most often associated with interiors. a louver is a window, blind or shutter with an arrangement of parallel horizontal or vertical blades (or slats) designed to regulate ventilation or sunshine while keeping out elements such as dirt or water. louvers designed for indoor use are typically made of wood, metal, plastic or glass. at flexfence, we’ve adapted the louver concept for exterior use by creating hardware kits that make it easy to mount louver blades in a frame – so you can build fences, gazebos, pergolas, etc. … [ continue ]

are there kits for louvered pergolas?
our flexfence louver system hardware kits can be adapted for any number of design projects and are especially useful for projects involving pergolas. you can even download a diy louvered pergola plan from our website.

can you add a louvered pergola roof to an existing pergola?
yes! you can use various methods to adapt our flexfence louver system hardware kits to outfit an existing pergola. one method involves adjusting how you mount the rails, while another entails constructing inner frames for easier installation and maintenance.

how do louvered pergolas work?
louvered pergolas work by incorporating adjustable louvers or slats, which can be arranged horizontally or vertically. these slats can be oriented to increase or decrease sun or wind in an area or closed entirely to protect you from light rain.

are louvered pergolas fully waterproof?
patios or terraces covered with louvers won’t be fully waterproof. while the louvers provide some protection, water can still drip through the sides where brackets and rails meet, and there definitely won’t be enough protection to shelter you against driving rain. a minimum slope of 30 degrees on awnings and overhangs can help water cascade over the louvers, but full waterproofing is not guaranteed.

can i paint various parts of the flexfence louver system?
yes! but you’ll need to use plastic-compatible paint.

how much do louvered pergolas cost?
the cost of a louvered pergola can vary widely. factors that influence the price include the type of materials you choose for your slats, the size of your pergola, and whether you’re constructing your pergola from scratch or just adding pergola louvers to an existing structure.
generally, you’ll need to consider the cost of framing, the type of wood you want to use (for example, cedar versus redwood or teak boards) and the number of boards and flexfence kits required to complete your project. you can use the flexfence calculator (located just below the dimension guide section on our website) to develop an estimate.

are louvers worth it?
louvers can be a valuable addition to your outdoor deck, veranda, patio or terrace. their adjustable slats allow you to control sunlight and air circulation, enhancing comfort. if you want to get more use out of your outdoor living areas, louvers provide a functional and stylish solution.

can i make gazebos, gates, fences or others projects with your flexfence louver system hardware kits?
yes! our system is designed to be adaptable. in our showcase section, you’ll find examples of customer-constructed louvered enclosures for outdoor bbq and entertaining areas, louvered hot tub areas, privacy walls and gazebos.

has the flexfence louver system been performance tested?
yes! flexfence has been independently tested for quality control. we post product test results for snow loads and wind on our website, and if you scroll down to just below these results, you’ll find information about our manufacturer’s warranty as well.we select only the highest-grade materials and adhere to manufacturing best practices to ensure our flexfence louver system hardware kits are strong and durable.

how can i be sure of my measurements?
to ensure accurate measurements for your project, follow a detailed plan and use precise tools. measure twice to confirm dimensions before cutting or assembling flexfence louver system components.
