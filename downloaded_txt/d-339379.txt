about 


usounds.com is the world’s premiere source of groundbreaking international underground pop journalism, featuring some of the finest writers to ever put fingertip to keyboard. usounds journalists embrace the experience of music as well as the music itself, travelling around the world in search of new sounds and scenes, and experiencing new levels of debauchery, poverty, and delusions of grandeur.
published on and off since 1972, usounds went electronic in 1996, gaining new fans and friends almost instantly. millions of confused visitors and hundreds of imagined awards and acknowlegements later, usounds basks in famed obscurity, publishing weekly reviews, downloads, international scene reports, food and drink recommendations, and whatever else happend to be on our mind at the time.

so enjoy usounds. please also check out our staff, and how you can join us. we always like to hear from our readers, so please contact us as soon as possible at usounds (@) gmail. that’s all for now, but watch this space as we plan to update it sometime in the next few years…

this man may or may not be our founder.
