our services















chinking & caulking
log home builders and homeowners continue to face the challenge of preventing air and water infiltration. we are experienced in the application of caulking in problem areas such as knots, checks, cracks, corners joints, butt joints, in between log courses and around windows and doors.log home repair and restoration services has extensive knowledge and experience in all forms of caulking and chinking applications. we use a series of high-quality textured caulking and sealants. chinking and caulking are available in a wide variety of colors. you can obtain a contrast appearance or choose wood tone colors that closely match your stain.we use a variety of modern chinking products that are much more elastic and durable than the mortar chinking of decades past. chinking is not always a user-friendly product, and the application is often meticulous and time consuming. we recommend the use of backer rod or “bond breakers” to obtain a two-point contact and to avoid a three-point adhesion.











cob blasting
cleaning with light low pressure washing( under 500 psi) is often recommended if your home needs a maintenance coat or additional coats of your current stain. however, careful consideration is needed to avoid damaging the wood fibers and/or leaking into your home. appropriate chemical cleaners will be used to remove dirt, grime, molds and mildew. rinsing is a must and proper drying time should always be a consideration.complete removal of existing stains is often necessary if the existing staining is failing or if you want a brand new look with new stains. this can be accomplished with chemical stripping or corn cob blasting.chemical removal of the finish includes application of chemical strippers that are used to remove the existing finish. this method does require complete rinsing and neutralizing of the wood before applying a new finish.corn cob blasting is a safe, environmentally friendly method that we also use to remove existing finishes. this method safely removes existing finishes using corn cob media which is a natural, bio-degradable product.











historic restoration & vintage lumber
log cabins are important symbols of our american history. log cabin construction methods were brought to america by european colonists. the history of log cabins shows us the diversity of construction methods of generations past . colonists often built the cabins from trees on the property where they settled. these cabins were often built from a variety of different species. a variety of hand tools were also used to construct these cabins of decades past. chinking was made from many materials such as clay, moss, stones, straw, mud and shredded paper.our company is very excited to be a part of preserving our cultural heritage. we are skilled in methods of repair and continue to implement plans to increase the longevity of these important structures. disassembling log cabins and relocating them to other locations is also an important part of our business. we have carefully disassembled cabins piece by piece. we carefully document, photograph and tag each piece of lumber for reassembly in order to accurately reconstruct the cabin in its new location.the use of vintage lumber in new construction and renovation today is an increasing popular option. vintage reclaimed timber from cabins is a dimishing commodity as some historic cabins are systematically being remanufactured into beams, flooring , timber frames and cabinetry. log home repair and restoration services can supply vintage materials based on availability for the discerning homeowner who is seeking that special touch for their home.











staining, sealing & finishing
we feel that the importance of applying quality log home finishes to your investment cannot be emphasized strongly enough. water and uv rays will destroy the structural integrity of your log home if left unfinished. the average home buyer will spend many hours discussing wood species and home design but are sometimes unsure about the products that are available.we are committed to giving special attention to the research of a variety of preservatives, stains and top coats available in the log home industry today. because our company believes in protecting your log home, we will work with you to establish the best product for your home while taking into consideration factors such as log species, moisture content and geographical location.finishes are available in water based and oil based finishes. oil based finishes are deep penetrating stains that soak deep into the wood and water based stains coat the exterior surface of the log. most home owners choose a clear transparent stain, semi transparent stain, semi solid stain or a solid stain. we do not recommend a clear stain but recommend a stain with pigment to offer your home more protection against uv rays.in order to professionally apply stains and finishes to your home, we properly prepare the wood surfaces and first apply a borate treatment to your logs. during the staining process, we also offer stain additives such as mildew ides and insecticides to assist with the treatment of problematic issues such as high humidity and insects.log home repair and restoration will assist you in obtaining the right finish and the right look for your log home. we can apply the finishes, help you with the application procedures needed for you to apply it yourself and assist you with purchasing the appropriate products.
