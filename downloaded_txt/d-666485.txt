          “it's rare to find a leader who is as caring about their team as scott. he helped me transition from corporate life into a remote first role by ensuring there was time both to get to know each other outside of focusing on business. he supported me by finding areas i could challenge myself to learn more, while also ensuring i was aligned with the objectives of the organization. 

what stood out to me most was when i was hit by covid-19 and taken out of work for nearly a month. even though i was not online he still made a point to check in with me every day, see how i was doing, and made sure i knew i could reach out if i needed anything. he would have happily driven across state if i needed, proving just how much he cares about those on his team. 

i consider myself lucky to have worked with him during my time at aha!”

          i could talk about product positioning all day. good product positioning makes it easy for buyers to see themselves, their routines, and their goals reflected in what you're offering them. sometimes it's shifting your product positioning from "what we do" to "what we do for you". 

what a dream getting to meet and talk with daniel murray of the marketing millennials podcast about:

➡  creating product positioning that resonates (and how we think about it at recharge
➡ sustaining brands in the routine economy
➡ why your first marketing hire should be a product marketer, and more

          the future of brm's product roadmap following our $21.6m series a + seed is looking pretty exciting.

let me walk you through what's live today and what we're launching next.

quick overview: we're doubling down on fixing the outdated vendor management process with our brm superagents. they're not just more quirky ai tools—our superagents are like having extra team members who actually enjoy doing the tedious stuff. 

here's what they look like right now:

➝ the contract collector
hunts down scattered and "misplaced" vendor docs across your email

➝ the renewal wrangler
gives you a heads-up so you never miss renewals + know what if/when to renew

➝ the pricer
helps figure out which package actually makes sense for you

➝ the compliance crawler 
handles all the risk and compliance documentation nobody wants to deal with

and we're just getting warmed up. 

we're also pumped about our newest superagent dropping in q1 (more on that soon, but sales people might not like that one)...

tl;dr: our funding helps push our investment in superagents, protecting your time and your budget.

so yes, 2025 will be a wild ride deep into the ai landscape. we're talking smarter tools and ai teammates that work alongside you, not just another piece of software you have to figure out. 

got any questions? let me know.

          hot take: the most impactful systems builders rarely come from it. they come from sales, ops, customer success—the people who live and breathe the problem they’re solving, who’ve been told “no” more times than they can count, and who can’t help but think about optimizing every process in sight.

these are the builders who see the inefficiencies hiding in the day-to-day and chase solutions to make things truly better, faster, and smarter. they’re the ones i want to see at the center of the future we’re building, not sidelined.

but here’s the key: both it and these frontline builders have to buy into working together. and i’m hopeful that ai can finally bridge this gap, helping each side speak the other’s language with minimal effort. when ai accelerates what no-code was always meant to be but hasn’t fully delivered on yet, we unlock the real potential of collaboration—systems that don’t just work, but transform the way we work.

let’s get there.

🧠 the mindset of highlighting weakness in product messaging may have been useful in the past, but it doesn't land like it used to.  

let me explain...

a shift i’m making in messaging: going from “highlighting the customer’s weakness” to “empathizing with the customer’s challenge.” 

here’s what i mean:

🚫 “highlight weakness” 
example:
“it departments often resort to reactive responses to issues. this is how our product will fix your weakness…”

✅ “empathize with challenge” 
example:
“it departments are often overwhelmed, therefore, all they’re able to do is react. this is how our product can help…”

🤔 the difference between these two messages is subtle, but important:

❌ the “highlight weakness” example isn’t useful to the customer. they often know their weaknesses and don’t need help identifying them. what you’re saying is, “you’ve got a glaring weakness, and you need us.” 

✔️ the “empathize with challenge” example is more purposeful. when you connect to the customer’s challenge, it puts your product shoulder-to-shoulder with them. what you’re saying is, “together, we can overcome this challenge.” 🤝

          “wow, that is *really* cool!”

that’s something i’ve heard over and over again when demoing our latest launch, prospector, to customers.

and not just from the reps who are burned out on manual processes and siloed point solutions, but also from the budget holders tired of paying for them.

just look at the state of modern prospecting and you’ll see why:
- reps dig through intent tools in search of in-market activity.
- they plug into account and lead scoring tools to make sure the account is the right fit.
- they tab between multiple point solutions to uncover relevant context, like job changes, job listings, and news events.
- they manually search through linkedin profiles to try to fill in the gaps.
- they hop over to account and contact enrichment tools to surface likely stakeholders.
- and they use prospecting tools to put together their lead lists.

👆 all before agonizing over email copy and jumping back to their sales execution platforms to start sequencing contacts.

reps pay in time. revenue leaders pay in budget. and businesses pay in lost efficiency and missed opportunities.

common room’s prospector fixes that by putting the entire prospecting process—from signal to send—on autopilot.

✨ auto-prospect the ideal prospects based on any account-level signals or fit criteria, including web visits, job changes, hiring trends, news events, and more.

✨ quickly surface the right stakeholders based on job title, role, seniority level, location, job-change history, and even linkedin follower count.

✨ automatically add any prospect who matches your filtering criteria to sales plays, personalized outbound sequences, salesforce campaigns, and hubspot workflows.

all in one place. all with one tool. all lightning-fast.

prospector is available now on all common room plans. sign up for free to see for yourself.

          saas leaders spend a lot of time on the micro. when will this feature ship? is that customer churning? what led to that production issue? even the most senior leaders often get caught here.

then you see okrs to match. trailing churn, grow revenue from new features, maintain x% uptime. and processes and tools spring up to measure all of this with drilldowns and rollups to match.

sure sometimes this starts with a strategic vision, identifying areas of opportunity, and then breaking that down into manageable tasks. planfully creating process and the organization to execute.

but i reckon that's less common than we'd like to admit. the secret is, it's often more like this:

- oh bleep, i just got a call that super important customer threatened to leave!

- let's get five people in an emergency meeting with the customer!

- the customer said the competitor has a better version of a highy specific feature! is an upgrade on our roadmap? how can we rally the team to execute on it sooner? we need a swat effort - who can we pull into a team without making any sacrafices?

- we need a r/y/g to discuss customers with this issue. and other customers with issues. and other issues we've noticed internally. we'll go through the list item by item, thrice weekly at 8 am.

- etc.

and this is of course all common and natural. once the firehouse starts it's hard to fit in anything but more reaction.

so the products and processes adapt to fit reality. and they grow. so we attempt to make that process we don't have time for twice as fast. and the overwhelm sets in, and the to do list gets too long.

since so many very succesful companies experience this that we assume it must be the way.

there isn't a magic fix, but i don't think it happens by saying "i'm going to spend less time on the micro by optimizing the time i spend on the micro." 

it starts by carving out time for macro strategy. this may be the 30 minutes that doesn't feel urgent researching your place in the market. maybe it's a call with a customer that doesn't need anything right now. or - i hope - a solution like rabble ai which can put the strategic priorities right in front of you in plain language.

will this turn the firehouse of micro off? no, nothing will. but at least it prevents the micro from completely washing the strategic away.

          i’ve noticed a lot of the same handful of big saas companies on podcast after podcast, article after article. and people gobble it up! as if ‘how we built roadmaps at apple in 2003’ is ever going to matter for your role at the auto mechanic records app. as if ‘user conference learnings at salesforce’ apply to your grocery store inventory platform.

even if you work for a unicorn – are the ‘habits of employee number 6’ relevant for you as employee 148,993?

a story. when i was young i was interested, as many young men are, in getting yoked. i would pore over muscle & strength and men’s fitness magazines, noting the diet and lifting habits of the latest mr olympia with great fascination. i even made lists! but i didn’t like lifting heavy or even going to a gym. the content i consumed didn’t match the situation i was in.

and that’s ok! the world needs middle distance running dads who enjoy an occasional power yoga class. and the world needs your lesson planning app for elementary school music teachers.

so i would recommend recognizing much of this content as entertainment for you. and look for education elsewhere. suggestions:

1) learn lessons from those companies that are more similar to you, and in your situation more recently. this may require talking to people from other companies one on one.

2) learn from your own company. get out of the feature factory and support tickets for bit. dive deep into your customers. spend time understanding results of different customer types. look at trends and develop strategies for causing inflection. talk to representative customers. 

3) hypothesize and act. since your product is unique, the best learning comes from doing and making adjustments along the way.

          1. how do i get customers, 2. how do i raise capital, were the most common things the current athena.vc cohort is asking about

this all goes back to:

1. do you have a 10x better product
2. and you're solving a very painful problem for which existing solutions are not very good.

if you have a generic product that is solving a problem which isn't that painful. you'll have to be very good at marketing and sales. that's fine, refer to : https://lnkd.in/gvsedwir

and https://lnkd.in/grnsqpns for what we did at contactout

but what is easier is to just make a 10x better product for a very painful problem.

e.g if you cure cancer, or solve nuclear fusion, or figure out how to make humans live forever. you clearly do not need to worry about sales or fund raising. 

even if you are very early and just have a few unique ideas in this space, people will flock to invest in you.

for example take a look at the types of companie sam altman is funding:

fusion: https://lnkd.in/gdjnn9rr
longevity: https://lnkd.in/guubkvxd
list of all investments: https://lnkd.in/gfeutecm

they are all world changing companies.

suprisingly solving a very hard problem is actually easier because you don't need to worry about sales and marketing. you can just focus on solving the technical challenges there is no market risk.

worrying about sales and marketing is hard.

so how do you get ideas about fusion, or longevity, or making a better search engine than google, or building a better gpu chip than nvidia:

1. talk to users
2. study competitors
3. talk to mentors / industry experts
4. read: science journals, text books, articles, podcasts etc, everything you can.

as sam atlman says: you will be surprised at how quickly you can become an expert. sam became expert in 1 year. there are 12 year old kids building nuclear fusion system in their bedrooms. steve wozniak single handedly built the apple ii - all software and hardware from reading textbooks and copies of mit research papers. all self study.

          one of my favorite parts of #plgtm was seeing nylas talk about how they are using inflection for event based nurturing. 
 
everyone is talking about “intent” and “signals” lately.  
 
**there is no better intent signal than someone using your product.**
 
there’s a lot of opportunity for companies to invest in nurturing for onboarding, product adoption, and methodical campaigns to drive revenue expansion... and inflection.io makes it easier for marketing to own that work.

          two things i’ve seen the best pms do really well: 

1. creating hype: they get everyone in the organization excited about any initiative and align xfn teams.

2. open-mindedness: they don’t get too attached to a specific idea. instead, they take a step back, view things objectively, and obsessively gather feedback from as many people as possible.

kevin anderson is one such awesome pm who has a genuine curiosity and  infectious passion for experimentation. 

i had a fireside chat with kevin last week hosted by statsig, where we discussed various topics, including the latest trends in experimentation, build vs. buy, reducing friction, measuring success, and so many insightful anecdotes that you can check out here:

          product videos...so great, so time consuming. 

i usually budget a solid half day, which includes scripting, product setup, recording (and re-takes), editing, exporting/optimizing, and uploading. (also includes time spent designing thumbnail images and animated slides, writing accompanying content, etc.)

some things that make my process slightly faster:

- writing a detailed script that i can look at on a second monitor
- do a complete run-through before recording to make sure the app is working properly
- pausing in between each sentence, which makes editing a whole lot easier
- pairing screenshots with voiceover when it makes sense.
- using a high quality microphone that i can use for live recording and voiceovers for consistent audio
- editing with davinci resolve
- optimizing video size with handbrake
- canva, of course, for visual design/slides and animated clips

          features don't matter, problems do.

today's approach: "what cool features can we build?", "what's our competition doing?", "what's trending in tech?"

result? bloated products nobody wants.

try this instead:
- document customer pain points
- ask "what's the simplest way to solve this?"

build that. only that.

example: 
wrong: "let's add ai-powered recommendations" 
right: "users struggle to find relevant content. how can we fix that?"

the best feature list isn't a wish list. it's a problem list with simple solutions.

          most gtm teams are flying blind when it comes to product data, and honestly, it’s not their fault…

let’s take customer success as an example.

success teams love metrics, but they almost universally lack access to usable data on ‘in-product’ customer performance. this means they can’t see when customers are struggling, which often leads to delayed actions—or worse, no action at all. they only realize there was a problem when the customer churns.

the frustrating part is that success teams are well aware of this. i’ve spoken with hundreds of companies, and only two had optimized their gtm strategy to fully leverage product data. yet, they all share the same desire: to have access to actionable data to help make their customers journeys better. but making that happen is really hard.

	1.	𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘁-𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘂𝗽 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗱
gtm teams focus heavily on the top of the funnel, leaving post-signup activities to success teams and onboarding flows, typically managed by product teams. even the best success teams can only do so much, making it difficult to identify which customers to prioritize.
	2.	𝗟𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀
tracking customer performance, such as feature adoption for specific segments, is nearly impossible for gtm teams. they’re often expected to wait for data help, or learn sql and rely on data analytics tools like amplitude or mixpanel, with no simple tools designed for them.
	3.	𝗠𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀
team kpis (e.g., number of outreaches) don’t always reflect customer success. the true measure should be customer performance data (e.g., onboarding, engagement, retention, expansion), which informs how much outreach is actually needed.
	4.	𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗱
with teams focused on onboarding, growth, and expansion, time is already stretched thin. adding more tasks, like learning sql or adapting analytics tools for their use case, becomes overwhelming.

𝗪𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗣𝗮𝘃𝗹𝗼𝘃 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺𝘀. 𝗪𝗲’𝗿𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝘅𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗯𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗚𝗧𝗠 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀.

          last friday, vinay hiremath, founder of loom (usd 900m exit to atlassian), shared on his blog about leaving loom, leaving $60m payout, breaking up with his girlfriend, dealing with insecurities, a brief stint at doge, and how he is now in hawaii self-studying physics.

i, along with a few founders i know who had substantial exits at a fairly young age (late 20s to early 30s), experienced something similar. post-acquisition, most of us underwent—and many are still going through—a self-discovery phase largely centered on finding a 'purpose' and determining the best possible use of our time at this point in life. does it mean taking risks that nobody else can, building more companies, accumulating more wealth, reaching the pinnacle of mental and physical health, building a family, getting involved in social impact, or leaving everything behind to sit on an isolated island?

capital does give you freedom and excessive optionality in life choices, especially if you're still unmarried. however, it is difficult to find your anchor, and most of the time, the abundance of choices becomes overwhelming. i was fortunate to meet a few exited founders who had gone through the acquisition process, and they were kind enough to share what worked for them.

in one of my conversations with david haber, he said: "as entrepreneurs, we build companies, but while we do that, we can't discount life. and life is what happens outside our companies."

that thought has stuck with me. today, three years after exiting recko | a stripe company to stripe, i feel there are multiple ways to make life more fulfilling. it is not just the single-minded, unidirectional professional pursuit, which more often than not is driven by a chase for external validation rather than an internal desire to become better at your craft or to do something that uplifts people around you.

until the time you find that burning desire, restlessness, or drive to pick up the shovel again, take that family trip, get in shape, try something that you always wanted but never could, embrace the nothingness, enjoy the boredom, and keep exploring!

          needing a break from getting back in the saddle after the holidays? love talking about saas metrics?

come join me with cj gustafson and ray rike where we'll be talking about benchmarking and metrics--what's changing (has changed), top metrics, best practices, and more.

unlike more lecture-based webinars, this is going to be more of a fireside chat conversation with two masters of metrics.

so get yourself a warm beverage, get comfortable, and pop in a question or two (or more).
