"i am honored to be assuming the 63rd presidency of air cre, just 60 years after my grandfather, jules altemus, co-founded and was elected as the first president of the organization in 1961/62. as president and as a member of the air cre board of directors, it is a privilege for me to be able to assist in leading this organization down a road that continues to embody the mission and vision of the founders, which includes fostering cooperation and a partnership mindset within the brokerage community as well as adhering to the professionalism and code of ethics that the organization was founded upon. in addition to all of the industry leading products and services that air cre offers the brokerage community, it is the character of the membership which is the foundation of air cre and has allowed it to not only survive, but thrive for over 6 decades."
