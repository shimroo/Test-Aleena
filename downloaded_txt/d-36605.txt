yes, i'm very familiar with bart baggett's programs since those are the ones i first studied for my certification. because of my own experience, i can highly recommend you start with his programs. they are easy to understand and will give you an excellent basis for your study. bart and curtis have a friendly, open style of presenting the material. throughout the course they also provide excellent examples of how to make your analysis understandable for the folks who hire you. in fact, i like bart's programs so much that i offer them for sale through my website.

i am making a $100 an hour reading handwriting at parties, impressing those with my highly accurate assessment of them without ever having met them before! and all my knowledge comes from bart's books, courses, and tapes. there is a great deal of depth to handwriting analysis, more than just entertainment. for those who want to really develop their knowledge of this skill, bart baggett's courses, without a doubt, lead the way.
