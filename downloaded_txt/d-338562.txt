dr. kathy ludwig, superintendent






welcome to the west linn-wilsonville school district! our incredible students, talented staff, supportive and dedicated community make this a tremendous place in which to learn and lead.our school district guides us with a compelling vision question, “how do we create learning communities for the greatest thinkers and most thoughtful people…for the world?” this question challenges us to continually hone our practices and skills in creating exceptional learning environments for our students. the question also challenges us to implement practices that help our students grow as thoughtful citizens and compassionate humanitarians. together, the vision question prompts us to continually engage our students’ minds and hearts. as the late poet, maya angelou declares, “do the best you can until you know better. then when you know better, do better.” we pledge to do our best when working with the children entrusted in our care. this year holds great promise, great opportunities and great accomplishments for each of them.with pride to lead wlwv,kathy ludwig
