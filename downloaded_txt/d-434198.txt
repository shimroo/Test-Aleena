our mission is to improve the lives of companion animals in new york city by rescuing and placing stray and abandoned cats, promoting spay/neuter programs, and working with members of our community to find humane solutions to problems involving homeless animals. 

























































"i've adopted three wonderful kitties from city critters over the years. not only did cc rescue them, but also (with their partner vets) got them healthy, neutered, vaccinated--and managed their adoptions.  i'm a believer."

"when my beloved mio, adopted from city critters, passed away i was heart broken.  after mourning, i reached back out to them. i trusted them so much that i welcomed loco in when they dropped him off even though we had never met.  now named loki, it was love at first sight. thank you city critters for bringing us together and for the important work you do with such love and dedication."

"i cannot thank holly and the city critters team enough for saving the life of my now adopted cat. i found him on the street after being hit by a car, and in less than 24 hours he was in the great care of city critters. after hours of phone calls and emails, i could not be more grateful that city critters was willing to save this kitty and help get him back to health (especially after having needed his leg amputated).  forever thankful!"

— sarah





"all my cats have been adopted from city critters - have three currently. i appreciate the vetting they do to make sure there’s a good fit between a cat and the potential home. they take the time to understand what personality of cat you are looking for, and the dynamics of the home etc."
