      our research centres
  






our research, our impact
land economy’s research concerns how society interacts with the environment, both natural and built. we are multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary, principally drawing on economics, law, finance and planning but also including insights from several other disciplines, from engineering to political science. our research is done by individuals and research centres and underpins our postgraduate and undergraduate teaching.
