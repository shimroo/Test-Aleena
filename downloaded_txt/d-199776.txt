smokey

                                                we adopted smokey the rabbit saturday afternoon dec 14th. since then i have counted no less than 100 “binky” jumps while running through the kitchen, living room and hallway.  he is having an absolute blast being a free roam bunny.   he is doing surprisingly well with the litter box training.   he is curious about the guinea pigs as they make noise when the fridge door opens.  he has had interaction with them and it has been great.  i think he is catching on already that when they squeak, the food shows up soon after. i just wanted to share that

toad & frog

                                                chandler & joey (previously toad & frog) are doing so amazing in their new home and are thriving with all of the space and enrichment that they have access to (2200 sqft, 5 cat towers, and wayyy too many toys!). their personalities have really shown and was the inspiration for their names. chandler is such a snuggle bug and has an obsession with our senior female cat luna who i think he sees as a mother figure. he wants to snuggle her all of the time, but as an older, timid tortie she is not there yet. he is a

                                                my mother recently adopted a dog from you. his name is: buck. when she came in to sign his final paperwork, she received a certificate team escha and buck received and was asked to send a photo of the certificate with her and buck. these days, buck’s talents have expanded to “stealing my mom’s heart”.  she thinks she has won the lottery in finding buck. thank you!

casey & delilah

                                                casey and delilah have been adjusting very well to our home. they took some time to warm up to us… they love cuddling before bed especially delilah. casey found her favorite spot on the top of the sofa right by our big window. they don’t play too much, but when they are in the mood and have the zoomies it’s adorable to watch. thank you again for the easy process and helping us find our fur babies. we are so blessed to have new additions to the family in their forever home.

french press

                                                i changed her name to blue (bluey) and she is doing fantastic! she plays well with my cats and loves to chase, she’s actually the same size and my male cat funny enough. she’s starting to get the hang of potty training but will still have between 1-4 accidents a day, so far have gone 1 full day with no accidents. 🙂 she knows how to sit and is sort of learning lay down (depends on the type of flooring), doesn’t whine in her kennel, is starting to get the hang of playing with her toys (squeaky toys and hangers
