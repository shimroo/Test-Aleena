hi! we arethe shepherds, michael & karin
we lived for ten years on the delightful isle of paros, greeceâ€“the all around island with something for everyone. we would like to invite you to share our piece of paradise through the pictures and visitor information throughout this web site.
during this time we also travelled extensively, both island hopping and touring the mainland of greece. thus this travel guide also provides photos, commentary, maps of the best islands and mainland sites to visit.
our insider experience and budget tips will enhance your personal greek odyssey.


where to find the best no deposit bonuses
we have just explained the different bonus options. the choice is still difficult because the offerings are extremely varied and confusing, especially for beginners. therefore, we have already carried out preparatory work and tested various casinos. here with us, the interested casino fan will learn everything there is to know about the best real money no deposit bonuses and the most lucrative online casino welcome bonuses without a deposit. all the player has to do is read our reviews and choose the best deal. we update our reviews regularly so that everyone is aware of the latest online casino bonuses. as offers change over and over again, it is recommended that you check in regularly. we guarantee that our information on the bonus offers of the most popular and best online casinos is always up to date.
software bonus: if you have a favorite provider, this bonus is perfect. you can only use games from one provider, for example, novoline, merkur, netent, etc.
no deposit sports betting bonus: if you are a sports betting fan, you can also get a no deposit sports betting bonus. this usually means a bet bonus in the form of an initial credit, which can then be used for an initial tip.
free spins bonus: this promotion means free spins https://www.casinosreviewed.net/casino-bonuses/free-play-casino-bonuses/ for selected slot games. however, when using free spins, always keep in mind the win limits and wagering requirements that are usually stated in the terms and conditions.
