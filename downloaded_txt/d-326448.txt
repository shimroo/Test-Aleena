welcome to b26.com
honoring wwii martin b-26 marauder air and ground crews.


b26.com is dedicated to martin b-26 marauder men who fought in world war ii. 
personal accounts, photos of crews and planes, and related information.

the first martin b-26 marauder mission flown was by the 22nd bomb group on april 5, 1942. launched from garbutt field, australia the
b26's staged through 7 mile drome near port moresby, new guinea to strike the japanese base at rabaul, new britain. the b26's had to stage through 
7 mile drome to top off the gas tanks to enable them to reach rabaul and then fly back to port moresby. the conditions encountered by the crews of the 22nd 
bomb group were primitive in the extreme by comparison with those of the 9th army air force (aaf) crews later in the war.
the last bombing mission by a martin b-26 marauder group was that flown on may 1, 1945 by the 17th bomb group 1st tactical 
air force. they bombed the gun positions on the isle d'oleron, france. the last martin b-26 marauder mission was flown by the 
1st pathfinder squadron when 8 of their b26's led 130 douglas a26's of the 386th, 391st, 409th and 416th bomb groups 
to the stod ammo plant in czechoslovakia on may 3, 1945. more info...
