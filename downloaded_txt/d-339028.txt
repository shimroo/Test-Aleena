me and my wife recently stayed in the fitzpatrick hotel on lexington avenue for a short christmas break. we were very pleased with the hotel, location, all staff and room. we stayed on the 16th floor and had a room with two double beds that was spacious with a closet room and bathroom with a walk in shower tray. beds and pillows were comfortable. the shower had good water pressure. we ate in the hotel restaurant which was tasty, shout out to the male waiter, i forgot his name, he was from ecuador and gave great service. if we return to new york, this will definitely be the hotel we go to.

the fitzpatrick’s manhattan hotel is truly an amazing place to stay if visiting nyc. very clean, cosy and comfortable room. great and helpful staff. the location is right in the heart of the city near main tourist attractions and shops. if you need to explore more it’s less than a 5 minute walk to the subway station.
would happily stay here again.

great stay and we are going back in april. just be aware that there are interior rooms which face the inside – no sky visible from the lower floor. can’t be helped – but the room makes up for it very nicely. it’s good for someone who does not want to hear the city traffic.

absolutely top class 👏 from the inital arrival and warm welcome from patrick at the reception desk to our departure after four wonderful days in the city we are not surprised why so many loyal people prefer to stay at the fitzpatrick’s. a massive thank you to chris who orchestrated our stay making sure all the family were happy, i cannot thank you enough. its comforting to know that you are being cared for by top hoteliers who love their business. we will be sure to return soon and will have this amazing location as a priority once again.

in this time of thanksgiving i am so grateful for the fitzpatrick manhattan and their staff!! i have been coming to this hotel with a heart since 2020 ! my husband has been patient at sloan kettering they have discount rate for family members. from chris, the general manager, merima at the front desk, brian and ashim in bar and restaurant to all the rest of the staff, your concern and care have always meant the world to me. i’ve always appreciated the irish flair and hospitality such as the barry’s tea and irish breakfast that bring a little extra warmth when i’ve needed it. i have come to consider the fitzpatrick a home away from home.
