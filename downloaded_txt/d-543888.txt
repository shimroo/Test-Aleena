inthru the seasons embrace hope my friends, imbolc is the time of hope for new life and the return of the light.in the us, most people think of february 2nd as groundhog day, the portent of how many more weeks of winter are in store. however, for thousands of years, imbolc, meaning “in the belly” was a sign of hope that the ewes were pregnant and there would be lambs born in the spring. people also noticed that the days were gradually lengthening.  hope is one of the most important emotions that allow us to feel alive and attract the possibilities that lead to feeling that we do have agency. when hope is purposely destroyed, we lose the will to live. read moretrusting divine love    dec 23 2024 browse archives for december 23, 2024  michael manning, ddmy mission is to empower

three-letter word god to describe a conscious awareness that includes everyone and everything in all creation. many refer to god as the creator, great spirit, universe, zero point, source, the divine, and other similar terms. if you are uncomfortable with the term god, you may substitute whatever term you are comfortable with.in recent years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented wave of political conflict, social unrest, and disheartening news. with daily updates that sow anxiety and concern, it’s easy to fall into despair and hopelessness. but what if, instead of being burdened by these worries, we turned to a deeper understanding of our faith? if we truly believed in and trusted god—recognizing god as love itself and knowing that god always has our highest good in mind—we could find profound peace even amidst chaos. read morewinter spiritual practices dec 08 2024 browse archives for december 08, 2024  michael manning, ddmy mission is to empower others to find their own

close to the solstice, is not only a time of celebration but also an opportunity for spiritual reflection and connection. here are some special winter solstice related spiritual practices that focus on personal growth, mindfulness, and connecting with others that you might consider:1. mindful gratitude: gratitude journaling: take time each day leading up to the solstice to write down things you are grateful for, focusing on the positive aspects of your life and the year you’ve had.acts of kindness: perform simple acts of kindness for others, such as volunteering, helping a neighbor, or writing uplifting notes to friends and family.2. reflection and intent setting: year-end reflection: spend some quiet time reflecting on the past year. read moreyuletide blessings    dec 02 2024

northern hemisphere, december 21st is the time of the longest night.the winter solstice is universally honored with lights the world over.people have burned yule logs and oil lamps, candles and bonfires. currentlyelectric lights are strung around our homes. my mother told me as a child thatthese traditions reassured us that days of longer sunlight would be returning. yet there is much to appreciate about darkness. indigenous wisdom holds that darkness is simply the other side of light and there is great creative power in the dark void. read moremercury turns retrograde again on

organization after the time of al's passing, as per al's request. spring of 1978 sami met al and became a member of esp lab. al ordained sami as a minister in his church on al's birthday june 19th, 1998. sami became a life member june 2, 1999. as an active member sami worked with al from spring of 1978 until his passing april 8th, 2006.  al is still working with esp lab and sami, from the other side. when al was asked  (after his passing) if he would continue helping with spiritual treatments al responded, "before they call i will answer!"sami started his spiritual quest at age five when his mother told him he had a spiritual father, god, who could answer prayers... sami was thrilled and promptly asked god and his mother for a puppy. mother said no but three days later in the culvert outside the church sami got his puppy.  this started a life long love of prayer, and a pursuit of the spiritual.sami, raised in  a christian home, started practicing yoga and studying all the religions of the world at 15.  sami wondered why prayer works and what are different methods around the world.  at 16 he attended all the local christian churches and started a devotional club in his high school which still is operational.  sami started laying on hands and praying for folks healing at the same time.sami, who considers himself eclectic, likes the words of sai baba who said, "all religions are facets of one truth, all are tributes to its glory." sami continues the work of spiritual quest with treatments for the success of every positive request received, through his work as a minister and president of spiritual science and esp lab.  he encourages everyone to find the divine light within and a positive path towards spiritual evolution. all posts from sami merlyn, dd 0no

greetings my friends,the time period between oct 31st and november 2nd is on the most widely celebrated ancient traditions that honors our ongoing connection with our ancestors. this includes those we knew in this lifetime, beloved great or great- great ancestors we’ve heard about, as well as ancestors from millennia ago. samhain, meaning ‘summer’s end’ heralds the thinning of the veil between the seen and unseen worlds. most of us have heard about or participated in the tradition of the day of the dead, celebrated in the us, mexico, and south and central america for a long time. it is a deeply significant celebration because folks can more easily connect to their loved ones who have passed. samhain is about ancestors’ love and support of us rather than the fear-based portrayal of goblins and ghouls who are out to get us. read morefall equinox newsletter : celebrate the cycle of life    sep 05 2024 browse archives for september 05, 2024  linda e. savage, ph.d. ddlinda e. savage, ph.d.

for it is mabon: the season of storing food and preserving nature’s bounty for the coming winter months. this year it will be on september 22nd at 8:44 am pacific time, just as the sun enters libra, the sign of the balancing scales. the term equinox refers to this balance of day and night. the cycle of life as evidenced by plants is: spring (birth) fall: seeds falling and going underground (death) only to grow again in spring: (rebirth). this cycle has been revered for at least 30,000 years; probably for as long as humans have gathered herbs and plants in familiar places during certain seasons.  read more2024 lammas newsletter    jul 18 2024 browse archives for july 18, 2024  linda e. savage, ph.d. ddlinda e. savage, ph.d. dd is a minister of spiritual science and a member of the

them at a communal meal has always been central to these gatherings, going back to thousands of years before the common era.  the celts called this time lughnasadh (loo-na-sa), native americans called it the green corn festival and in slavic regions it is called the feast of the big glad woman. ireland celebrates lammas as big sunday and farming communities gather at hundreds of traditional hilltop sites to set up craft fairs, feast, play games, and dance. a part of every one of these gatherings is a ceremonial meal where the first fruits of the harvest are shared in gratitude to mother earth.

midsummer, this solstice (meaning ‘sun stands still’) is when the sun is at its peak; it is the longest day of the year and celebrated in some way in all cultures. the next day, on june 21st we have an auspicious full moon in capricorn, making this particular solstice more powerful. summer solstice celebrations have been a time for merry making for millennia. not only is it one of the eight great spokes on the celtic wheel of seasons but also midsummer’s eve is one of the three important spirit nights of the year; the other two are beltane (may day) and samhain (halloween). read morebeltane

bloom, offering their pollen to the bees. the celtic name for this period is beltane, which means bright or sacred fire. during the festival, great bonfires were lit and animals and fields were blessed in hopes for an abundant year. traditionally may day began on the eve of may 1st and was celebrated with feasting, dancing, and merriment for two weeks. lovers knew that sexual energy is a most powerful connection to spirit as well as it plays an essential role in the abundance of all life.  beltane was a time when lovers ran off to the fields and woods together to honor the great
