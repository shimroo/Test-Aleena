sign up now!








are you tired of the 
      same materialistic and mundane conversations day after day? are you 
      frustrated and disappointed by the quality of people you encounter? are 
      you looking for others who you can connect with and possibly cultivate 
      some meaningful friendships?welcome to this new site 
      which was created to help people locate and meet other spiritual 
      like-minded people in their own cities. in this busy and fast-paced world, 
      it can be a challenge to find others who have the same goals, morals and 
      values as ourselves. having made spiritual growth a priority in our lives, 
      many things in our life begin to change for the better. we may notice, 
      little by little, that the things that used to give us pleasure and 
      fulfill us, no longer do. we make changes to our lives to preserve the 
      positive energy and begin to remove the obstacles which hinder our 
      spiritual growth. we may desire new friendships that help us reflect upon 
      our own ideas and realizations.... and hopefully you can find them here at 
      spiritualfriend.com.
peace & love,
your friends at spiritual 
      friend.com

* this site 
supports self-realization and is not intended to be of a religious 
nature *
















it can be 
      frustrating and disappointing to be missing that "connection" with many of 
      the people we meet. we are tired of the same materialistic and mundane 
      conversations day after day. we are seeking those people with whom we can 
      relate. those connected individuals who have made self-realization a 
      priority in their lives. with the help of the universe... and hopefully 
      this site, may you find those who will compliment your spiritual journey.
