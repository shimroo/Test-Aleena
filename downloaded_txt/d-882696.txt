can't believe the temperature difference!

this cooldome as you call it is truly incredible. we installed this housing in a spot that hit 120 degrees f. we checked the temp inside the camera housing and it was only 80 degrees f. this ptz camera housing is so freaking cool. i couldn't believe the temperature difference until i saw it. simply amazing.

best and easiest dome cleaning tool ever!!

i was a little skeptical at first but this kit is so easy to setup and use that i bought 3 more. i've saved my staff so much time using these domewizard kits. my staff especially loves that they don't have to use the cherry picker anymore. i highly recommend this kit.

works great!

it does a fantastic job cleaning the lenses. super easy to use and surprisingly very lightweight. i use this on several jobs inside and out and it's so nice not to have bring a ladder, bucket, and what not. the cleaning kit and cleaning solution is all i need now. so nice.

technical help on purchase

the pinout for the power cable i ordered seemed confusing.  when i called technical support, i was put in touch with the engineer who designed the cable, and he was quickly able to give me the proper information.
