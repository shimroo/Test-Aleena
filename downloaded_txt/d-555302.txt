    welcome
            to what i gladly call mikes mess.  i started this page
            back in
            1998, and believe it or not it is still going.  we have
            been
            through many form factors since i started this page, but i
            pretty much
            have kept it to iit's original form.  i am a long time
            record
            collector and enjoy music from the 50s and 60s and even
            early
            70s.  from my early days of listening to the radio in
            the mid 50s
            to the middle 70s, music has been a big part of my
            life.  this was
            (and still is.) my first love (my 2nd being
            computers.)  this page
            is to entertain and hopefully give you a little incite on my
            love of
            music and me in general.  so i say welcome to my world
            of mikes
            mess.

   
below
are
            many links to the various things available on mikes
            mess.  we hope you enjoy them and remember they are
            free for you
            to tell others and hopefully have them enjoy the hobbies i
            so much
            enjoy.  we have old time radio, oldies, internet radio
            stations,
            and old tv and movies.  this is a history of life many
            of today's
            generation have never even seen or heard.  hopefully
            even if you
            were not old enough to experience this part of history you
            can
            appreciate it and come often for new oldies, old time radio
            and movies
            and tv shows.  so once again i want to welcome you to
            my world of
            mikes mess.
