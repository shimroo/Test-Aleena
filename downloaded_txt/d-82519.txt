removable reusable blanket insulation & shields

reuse once,and our removable insulation pays for itself

since 1988, shannon has designed, manufactured and installed more than 750,000  removable, reusable blanket insulation and shields for manufacturing plants, power generation facilities, universities, hospitals, oil and gas facilities and government buildings around the globe, making shannon’s specifications in design and manufacturing the worldwide standard. shannon’s customers have generated more than 620 million dollars in cumulative energy savings.shannon thermal blanket customers’ typical payback period is 12 – 24 months!our high quality blanket systems are osha compliant, astm/iso/ul tested and backed by csi specification standards unmatched in the industry.










thermal
blankets / shields
to achieve energy conservation, thermal efficiency & safety for high-pressure steam, processing, hot or chilled water, or engine-exhaust systems, apply reusable, removable insulation to high-temperature, radiant surface conditions on valves, fittings and complex surfaces often uninsulated.



more info






acoustic
blankets / shields
to attack radiant noise from problematic surfaces such as compressors, pumps, fan housings, piping, ducting, motors, engine exhausts, turbines and complex surface geometries that often go untreated, apply reusable, removable insulation for a 4 dba to 20 dba reduction.



more info






safety
blankets / shields
whether you’re protecting workers from burns or equipment (e.g., movs, cameras) from catastrophic temperature spikes, wash-down conditions or processing fluids, protect employees and sensitive gear with a reusable shannon fire blanket, rain shield, heat shield or spray shield.



more info






sustainability
blankets / shields
each year, a typical facility loses $30,000 in energy and emits 200 tons of c02 because gate valves, heat exchanges, steam traps and more are poorly insulated or uninsulated. a one-time investment in shannon custom-fit, removable / reusable insulation blanket system stops the attack every year, for up to 15 years.
