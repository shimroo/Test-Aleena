according to judith appelbaum, author of how to get happily published, "it is largely within your power to determine whether your work will get published and whether the public will buy it once it's released." anyone who has had a manuscript boomerang back from every publisher who sees it (or a book remaindered mere months after publication) may view this assertion with some amount of skepticism. but, as appelbaum says, "hardly anybody treats getting published as if it were a rational, manageable activity," and it's hard to argue with that.in addition to providing a mini-course on editors and agents and submissions and funding--peppered with revealing anecdotes from the front lines--appelbaum offers information less frequently found in books of this sort.to begin with, an announcement for professional writers, would-be writers and people who have important things to say from time to time and want to say them in print: it is largely within your power to determine whether your work will get published and whether the public will buy it once it's released.more information: how to get happily published
