the purpose of clearstar security
network is twofold...


1. 
to serve the professional security industry
(locksmiths, safe technicians, suppliers, manufacturers,
associations, etc):




foster the integrity and development of the  professional security
industry.


foster community in the industry by establishing a globally accessible 
network.


provide an online index of resources and references available to the
industry.


provide a means for feedback and communication among all segments of the industry. 

2.  to serve the public
(whose physical
security needs are entrusted to the professional security industry):

listing of reputable security professionals - locksmiths & safe-techs - by city and state
provide basic information on locksmithing and security services with
definition of terms. 

provide a security checklist for facilitating a consultation with your
local security professional.
