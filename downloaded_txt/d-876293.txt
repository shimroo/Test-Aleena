sandy 2012








after killing almost 70 in the caribbean, sandy smashed into the eastern seaboard of the u.s. on monday, oct. 29, 2012, bringing with her high winds, destructive tides, and snow. hardest hit were new york, new jersey, pennsylvania, and maryland. with a death toll climbing past 125 and an economic cost estimated at $50 billion, superstorm sandy is a force to be reckoned with. in comparison, 2011's hurricane irene claimed 44 lives and cost $10 billion, while katrina still reigns as this country's and century's worst natural disaster, with at least 1,836 people lost and damages estimated at around $125 billion. superstorm sandy's dubious honors include the highest storm surge of 13.88 ft (4.23 m) at battery park, n.y; and record low barometer readings in new jersey, pennsylvania, and maryland around the 948 mb mark. sandy was also, even against hurricane standards, exceptionally large, with hurricane-force winds covering a 175-mile distance from her center, and tropical storm-force winds extending beyond a 500-mile radius. with such wind velocity and range, it is not surprising that the u.s. department of energy reported more than 8.6 million people without power in the superstorm's aftermath, leaving more people in the dark than any other storm in history.new york manhattan suffered a widespread power outage during the storm. governor of new york andrew cuomo declared a statewide state of emergency and asked for a pre-disaster declaration on october 26 which president obama signed later that day. by october 27, major carriers canceled all flights into and out of jfk, laguardia, and newark-liberty airports, and the metro north and long island rail roads suspended service. the tappan zee bridge was closed, and later the brooklyn battery tunnel and holland tunnel were also closed. on long island, an evacuation was ordered for south shore, including areas south of sunrise highway and north of route 25a and in elevations of less than 16 feet (4.9 m) above sea level on the north shore. in suffolk county, mandatory evacuations were ordered for residents of fire island and six towns. most schools closed in nassau and suffolk counties on october 29. the brooklyn–battery tunnel remained flooded on the tuesday morning after the storm.new york city began taking precautions on october 26. governor cuomo ordered the closure of mta and its subway on october 28, and the mta suspended all subway, bus, and commuter rail service beginning at 7 p.m. edt. after hurricane irene nearly submerged subways and tunnels in 2011, entrances and grates were covered just before sandy, but were still flooded. path train service and stations as well as the port authority bus terminal were shut down in the early morning hours of october 29.. later on october 28, officials activated the coastal emergency plan, with subway closings and the evacuation of residents in areas hit by hurricane irene in 2011. more than 76 evacuation shelters were open around the city.on october 29, mayor michael bloomberg ordered public schools closed and called for a mandatory evacuation of zone a, which comprises areas near coastlines or waterways. additionally, 200 national guard troops were deployed in the city. nyu langone medical center canceled all surgeries and medical procedures, except for emergency procedures. additionally, one of nyu langone medical center's backup generators failed on october 29, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of patients, including those from the hospital's various intensive care units. u.s. stock trading was suspended for october 29–30.new jersey airmen of the new jersey national guard's 108th wing assemble before being sent to assist at various emergency shelters.preparations began on october 26, when officials in cape may county advised residents on barrier islands to evacuate. there was also a voluntary evacuation for mantoloking, bay head, barnegat light, beach haven, harvey cedars, long beach, ship bottom, and stafford in ocean county. governor of new jersey chris christie ordered all residents of barrier islands from sandy hook to cape may to evacuate, and closed atlantic city casinos. tolls were suspended on the northbound garden state parkway and the westbound atlantic city expressway starting at 6 a.m. on october 28. president obama signed an emergency declaration for new jersey, allowing the state to request federal funding and other assistance for actions taken before sandy's landfall. on october 28, mayor of hoboken dawn zimmer ordered residents of basement and street-level residential units to evacuate, due to possible flooding.on october 29, residents of logan township were ordered to evacuate. jersey central power & light told employees to prepare to work extended shifts. most schools, colleges and universities were closed october 29 while at least 509 out of 580 school districts were closed october 30. although tropical storm conditions were inevitable and hurricane force winds were likely, the national hurricane center did not issue any tropical cyclone watches or warnings for new jersey. this decision was because sandy was forecast to become extratropical before landfall and thus it wouldn't be a tropical cyclone.
