about 








 
carhenge - discover nebraska's unique tribute to stonehenge. 


you ask, why carhenge? creator jim reinders responds to that question simply with one of his own: “why not?”



carhenge is open year-round, from dawn to dusk for visitors who love to experience something different.
 
you will not find a to scale replica of england’s stonehenge quite like this anywhere else in the world.

in addition to the monument, we have various car art sculptures and a gift shop that is open seasonally. for off season souvenir shopping, check out the online gift shop.

we would love it if you came to see us and stopped into town for dinner, drinks and main street shopping in our charming business district.
