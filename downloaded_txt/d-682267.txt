m's vacation week  


all this week she's been making paintings with a circle motif to give to family for christmas/hanukkah. she's been getting lots of books and clothes. she said this evening, as she excitedly looked through her new shirts and skirts, "a lot of kids feel let down when they get clothes as presents, but not me, no way. 'letdown' isn't even in my vocabulary!"  this evening, she's doing her own laundry and folding it while watching "how the universe works".       posted via email  from mirandaland

m's ideal afterlife  


m said, "when people talk about where they want to go to be happy after they're dead, they call it heaven. i call it home. after i die, i'd want to spend my time right back here in my home, living as a kid again, with the same people."       posted via email  from mirandaland

m's mood  


"it's too bad that it gets dark so early these days. i seem to get a little depressed after circus class on wednesday afternoons. i think this year i might be getting my first case of s.a.d.--you know, seasonal affective disorder?"       posted via email  from mirandaland

m's fears for the future  


i was playing a science fiction game in a city full of flying cars, and showed it to m. she said, "that's creepy!""why? you don't like the idea of flying cars?""no, i just think it's going to be a dark future when a generation only knows how to order robots around."  posted via email  from mirandaland

m's crepuscular musings  


watching the last vestiges of the sunset from our car window as we drove to dinner, m said, "whoa!""what is it, bunny?""look at the gradient the sky is making. it goes from blue to dark red without getting messy at all. nature can do that." as the gradient disappeared and the sky became more fully dark, she continued, "every sunset is something to be cherished...just like every apple on the tree should be tasted, and..." she paused, looking for the right completion for her analogy, then finished: "...every person you know must be loved."  posted via email  from mirandaland
