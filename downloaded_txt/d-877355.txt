welcome to 
the village of bedford park


























 





welcome to bedford park!
the village of bedford park is an illinois home rule community located on the southwestern border of the chicago city limits. the village is near chicago’s midway airport and is minutes away from downtown chicago. it is part of an illinois enterprise zone and is also an integral partner of the illinois and michigan heritage canal corridor where the im-hcc visitors center is located in the heart of the village. we believe we have the perfect combination of a great place to live and a great place to do business in. thank you for visiting our website and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us!
