m. moleiro
"m. moleiro is the most prestigious company in the world specialised in the reproduction of codices, maps and works of art usually made on parchment, vellum, paper, papyrus ... between the 8th and 16th centuries in the form, in most instances, of illuminated books. the techniques employed in reproducing the codices, combined with the wisdom and skilled craftsmanship of our trade, enable us to remain very faithful to the original. bound in leather tanned used the methods of years past and reproduced on special, hand-made paper, our codices reproduce all the nuances of the paintings, parchment, gold and silver leaf etc. an m. moleiro codex is, therefore, more than a facsimile book, it is an exact replica, a 'first, unique and unrepeatable edition'."
