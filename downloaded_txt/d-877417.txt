about
our story

step into the dynamic realm of topog-e®, llc, a pioneering force in the manufacturing of rubber gaskets for steam, air, and water applications since 1956.
fueled by the imperative to address the shortcomings of fibrous gaskets in boilers, topog-e®, llc emerged as a solution to the age-old question: “why couldn’t a boiler gasket be made out of rubber?” the unreliability of existing fibrous gaskets led to prolonged and costly downtimes, sparking the inception of a company dedicated to sealing solutions.
the journey began with the establishment of topog-e®, llc, where innovative minds crafted a gasket capable of seamlessly conforming to the topography of mating surfaces. the proprietary mixture, fine-tuned in response to the challenges of the steam environment, marked the genesis of a groundbreaking venture.
today, topog-e®, llc stands as a testament to perseverance and excellence. producing approximately 1 million gaskets annually in over 300 sizes, the company still takes pride in mixing its own compound and conducting on-site manufacturing. over two generations, the company has evolved while maintaining an unwavering focus, commitment, and passion.
from its modest origins, topog-e®, llc has grown into a globally represented enterprise. investing in cutting-edge technology, expanding production capacity, and advancing research and development, the company continues to broaden and enhance its gasket offerings.
the iconic series 180 rubber gaskets, representing the company’s roots, now share the stage with series 2000 gaskets manufactured from exfoliated graphite. these series 2000 gaskets, renowned for their superior sealing capabilities, cater specifically to medium and high-pressure/temperature applications.
embark on the journey of topog-e®, llc, a story of innovation, evolution, and a commitment to sealing excellence that transcends generations.

what people are saying

hospital organization





of all the gaskets i have used these are definitely the best.
apparel company





these gaskets gave perfect results on a mighty tough test installation. i will certainly recommend them every chance i get.
water conditioning service







thank you for the speedy delivery of gaskets i ordered. now that i know how quick and easy it is to replace your gaskets i’ll never use fiber gaskets again. where i had trouble with boiler compound seeping through, it is now gone. thank you.
laundry company





topog-e® gaskets are the best in my opinion – no one makes a better gasket. they save life on equipment and save money in the long run by not having to shut down or go through a number of gasket change outs in a single year. i recommend them to other supervisors and workers in other regions.
