 i was a salary plus overtime member of management with lowe's home improvement.  my overtime rate was half of my normal rate, and decreased gradually as my hours of overtime increased.  we referred to it as "chinese overtime"   i have a print out of all my time worked while at lowe's including the overtime in question.
