security. it's what we do.

risk assessments for life safety and asset protection is our expertise. security has been our business for more than 30 years. we also work closely with law enforcement to fully understand the methodology of the criminals and to overcome their best efforts.we’ve gained a reputation for providing practical and cost effective security for our clients. in addition, we’re more than just an electronic security company! we are also able to provide comprehensive solutions for risks of all types.security is also not a free system that includes two doors and a motion, sold and installed by teenagers and students on college break; if that is your definition, there are other companies in the marketplace that can help you feel better.if you’d like to depend on your security plans actually functioning effectively and as intended, you’ll need someone with significant experience, training and capabilities. every effective security plan will include the “five d’s”; deter, detect, delay, deny, and, defend. if your security company is not familiar with these concepts, it time to upgrade your security company!! 












our systems 



for more than 30 years, advantage security has been providing security services throughout central pennsylvania. no other company in the area offers better and more proven effective systems for catching the bad guys! we provide thorough  solutions for reliable and dependable loss prevention. in our view, it makes sense to call the security guy before a loss so that you don’t need to call the police after the loss has taken place!advantage security inc. is able to provide a security solution designed for your needs that will effectively provide life safety and asset protection!  













 














why choose us? 



monitor without a phone line or cellular costs and eliminate vulnerabilities, and do better and faster! also, eliminate the need for paying to keep upgrading to the latest iteration of cellular technology! as a midsize local security company, we’re large enough to provide 24 hour service, logistics and support, and yet small enough so that clients can be familiar with our team of employees. our product offering allows us the ability to solve unique and challenging applications for our clients. when it comes to security, it all comes down to who you trust and their proven and verifiable reputation.too many companies in the security field are more interested in selling something rather than providing proven solutions. in many cases they may not even understand the latest risks or solutions.given the opportunity, we’ll  review with you the potential deficiencies of an existing or proposed system or plan and provide an assessment of vulnerabilities. you may be surprised to learn of deficiencies that you didn’t know exist, the other companies didn’t tell you, or perhaps they just don’t understand.thorough and complete risk assessment and the ability to provide better solutions is ultimately why clients choose advantage security inc. over any of the others.compare and you’ll quickly understand and appreciate the advantage security inc. difference!
