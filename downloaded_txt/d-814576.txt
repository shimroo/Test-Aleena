the ab website has grown over the last few years and became rather difficult to easily update and keep our products up to date so we have now reformatted it to hopefully not only make it easy for you to find products but also make our life easier to update pages as the product range grows. it may be the case there are a few products missing from the previous version, this may be because they are no longer available or out of date. if you require anything not on the site please feel free to contact us at abslotsport@btinternet.com and we will try and obtain it for you.
if you find a product but the âbuy nowâ buttons have been blue boxed, the item is temporarily out stock.

redesigned super tough motor shaft press, suitable for 2mm and 1.5mm brushless motors. we have noticed during working with some motors that the ballraces can have a slightly slightly tight id which makes removing the original shaft a bit of a pain so we now also have a 2mm id counter board press t bar which keeps the new 2mm shaft in line to fit the new 2mm shaft while pressing out the original shaft.
