trillium travel trailers















the outback a vintage fibreglass trailer




the trillium trailer, named after ontarioâs provincial flower, has an illustrious history, and has long been a popular economical alternative to full-size recreational vehicles. the trailers were first introduced in the early 1970s and were built by trillium recreational vehicles ltd. in markham, ontario. many rvers were overjoyed to find a waterproof trailer that could be towed by a small or compact car and legions of fans purchased the trailers in droves.
outback trailers now produces their own model of the trillium trailer, a vintage reproduction called the outback.





we believe in lightweight compact design




outback trailers believes in lightweight design, allowing you to go further, making the most of your fuel economy. â we retool them to make them fit newer, more modern technology, which means smaller, more efficient components are going into the trailers. â they can fit in your garage when not in use, making them easy to store. â compact and efficient, these trailers are sure to make your vacationing a breeze.
