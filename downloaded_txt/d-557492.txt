rick holt home page -- down on the farm with ranger rick holt






 
a personal greeting from rick holt (hello.wav 105 kb)

thanks for stopping by. on these pages you'll get a glimpse of some of the things
  that i get excited about. for almost 50 years now i've been known to most 
	folks as "ranger rick." for 27 years i worked at
  downs park 
	in anne arundel county, maryland and eventually took a position as chief of 
  park maintenance and finally superintendent of
	anne 
	arundel county trails.  in 2012 i retired from anne arundel county 
  department of recreation and parks. currently i working half-time for the 
  state as a groundsman for the state house grounds in annapolis.
for many years i also wore another
  hat as "farmer rick,." since my wife 
  cindy and i for about 17  years grew
  vegetables for our roadside market on the old family farm 
	on mountain road.  we  re-built the farm in a new
  image as we entered the new millennium. find us at
	dun-pikin farm - pasadena, maryland 
	- riding lessons, boarding, training, camp, pony rides, pony party,petting 
	animals so the other half of my time is dedicated to the farm. sometimes i'm not sure who i am, but i'm always busy!

raised in dundalk, and proud of it!

when i make changes to these pages i usually put a note on the what's
    new page

      birds and birding - since my college days i've been an avid birder and while we're on the subject of birds 
		how about: ranger rick and breakfast with the 
		birds ,  early birders catch a glimpse of 
		woodpeckers in state park, and ranger rick in 
		search of the yellow-billed cuckoo



spent 12 years of my childhood in catholic
      school. it didn't do me any harm. i'm being
      facetious, of course. beyond my parents this
      was the single biggest influence on my character.
