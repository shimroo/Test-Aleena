the place where we live, now ended 





this blog ran between 2004 and 2007. in 2005, it was awarded the "top 10 chicago bloggers we wish we knew (but don't)" by gaper's block.Â  the last post was in 2007. thank you to all who have read the blog and commented on it. i learned so much; i set out to understand what drove jane jacob's work and discovered my own.

tpwwl moves to about.com - chicago





 effective today, i have "gone live" as the about.com guide for chicago locals. you can find the site here. about.com is a new york times company, and i am pleased to have this opportunity. after three years of blogging here for "love and comments," (as pound's wendy mcclure once described it), i will be paid to blog about chicago.i'll be taking my e-mail address down from this site and substituting it with my new address soon. i hope you'll stop by and see what's up at the new site. i'm the only one behind the chicago content curtain, so to speak, so i'd appreciate your feedback, ideas, and visits. it's definitely a work in progress as this site always was, too. i'll leave the place where we live up, but this will probably be its last official post. as you'll note from the previous post, it's been a year of transitions for me. or, i should say, attempted transitions. (no new home.) but, i'm very pleased that the answer that has come through all this writing is that i get to belong to the entire community, not just once spot of it. and, that feels nice. peace to all who come to this post. thank you for reading. --jennifer

welcome back to the beaches!





"the month of may not only brings proverbial flowers, but it also brings back the sun worshippers, dog owners, baby jogger owners, sightseers and, unfortunately. . .trash. my husband and i volunteer for the alliance for the great lakes, and i serve as a beach captain for north avenue beach. we organize clean-ups five times a year. our kick-off clean-up was on april 14 to coincide with earth day. it was a sunny day, but gloves and hats were the preferred attire as the wind was whipping across the beach, pulling in the cool winter air from lake michigan. we organized a small group of volunteers to comb the beach for trash."this is an excerpt from an article by ann hopkins avery, who warmly ushered me into the realm of beach stewardship at north avenue. she wrote it for the great lakes town hall. read her full article here.i was among that small group of volunteers with her in april. the beach was disgusting, filled with cigarette butts, plastic wrappers, and plastic bottle parts as she has described. i personally removed a queen-sized bed sheet from the sand. someone else carried up a wooden boat ladder.our lakes need a lot of tlc. i had never heard about the great lakes town hall before i learned of ann's article, but it's a meaningful meeting place to start learning more if you're interested and want to help. [another good place, of course, is the alliance for the great lakes.]

how many people died in the chicago fire?





i often find myself asking this question whenever the topic of the fire comes up.you hear about the devastation, the rebirth, the cow, but rarely do you ever hear about victims. that omission just doesn't fit with how americans tend to relate to disasters, including historic ones.for instance, doesn't it seem like there would have been some notable memorial for the victims of the fire erected by now given the great standing this event has in our city's history?or, if there were no victims, isn't that a remarkable aspect of the fire that's worthy of greater attention?the newberry library took a stab at answering the question in 2003. basically, they don't know how many. maybe about 300. their remains were probably left and built over. you can find the full explanation here.[i just stumbled across this photo of a recent memorial statue erected at the site of the (supposed) start of the fire.]photo courtesy of the chicago landmarks commission here.

lincoln park community organizations - what are the benefits?





vi daley's run-off election seemed to reveal a lot of issues with our community's organizations. if you check in with the comments still blazing on this blog's recent "vi daley" post, you'll see some of it.in my pre-election comments, i complained that i thought our community was sliced and diced into so many different groups and organizations that it didn't help foster a sense of community, build consensus, or allow us any collecctive voice or power to address situations that affect us all (e.g., zoning, children's memorial hospital).others think the organizations lack financial transparency.on the other hand, the community groups do contribute a lot -- the festivals, like the sheffield garden walk and old town art affair, are arguably very enjoyable events with long histories and wide participation.here's a list of community organizations in lincoln park* that represent neighbors and residents.diversey harbor lakeview assngold coast neighbors lincoln central assocationnear north property ownersmid-north asscociationnorth dearborn associationold town merchants & residentsold town triangle association park west community assocation ranch triangle assocationsheffield neighborhood assnwrightwood neighbors what are the positive things and benefits these organizations bring to our community? please comment.here are the ground rules of this forum: i will do a follow-up post for debating the organizations' drawbacks, so i will delete negative comments left on this post. whenever possible, please mention the community group by name. you may be anonymous, but please choose a "handle" like "chicagoabc" or "johndoe45" to post under, so we may better follow the debate among anonymous commenters.so, what do you really appreciate about these community organizatons?*the only place i could find this list was on alderman vi daley's website, to her credit.

the artist project: new scenes from chicago's urban landscape





i've got band-aids on both big toes from walking the remarkable artchicago on monday. what a visual feast!the artist project offered independent artists a seat at this sprawling art market's table.many of them explored chicago's urban and natural landscape as their subject matter. here are two.william dolan william dolan's work is at right. the first painting is called "blue caprice. "the second one is titled "the corner revisited."i love the way dolan captures the edgier sides of the city with croppy, up-close compositions and vibrant colors.you can find out more about him at his website here. hiroshi ariyama hiroshi ariyama is a printmaker. he displayed images from a series he's been working on called "our city, our neighborhood." this one below is called "distant storm." i really enjoyed the way his graphics reduced chicago scenes to their essence.  he isn't just capturing moments, he's making them seem captured and held still, sort of like postcards do. you can find hiroshi at the ariyama studio online here.

off-topic: paparazzi post





 my older brother, john, lives in brooklyn and helps run a tv lighting company called liberty lighting. in other words, he's a gaffer. and, he's really, really good at it. so good that barbara walters always hires him to light her for her interviews and feature shows.  you can see her at left in this photo without his lighting.occasionally, he sends us photos from his celebrity shoots, and i e-mail them out to my friends like the proud sister i am. thought i'd run one here, too.

for sale: lincoln park's last little worker's cottage





no corner in lincoln park better exemplifies the changing built landscape of this neighborhood than howe and armitage. 

that's where you'll find this little blue gem from 1886. it's dwarfed by the three-, four-, and five-lot palaces that have risen all around it. now, it's a complete anomaly.

sadly, it's probably also awaiting its slaughter.

it's been for sale at least since 2005 when i took these photos. (although little about it has changed.) the asking price is $575k for 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, a sizable yard and a finished basement.

the listing sheet reads, "renovate. . . or tear down and build your own in the lincoln school district." there will be no internal showings. you have to buy it "as is." there are renters living there now, but they are on a month-to-month lease, according to the listing.

one of the things that has probably saved it from the bulldozers so far is its small lot size. it's only 17 x 80 versus the standard 25 x 125. that makes it more difficult for developers to extract a profit from it.

i'm often in the middle on preservation issues. in general, i'm sympathetic to the notion that we should preserve aspects of our built history. i don't think we should rush to tear everything down. i'd prefer, in many instances, that we try to renovate buildings and find creative re-uses for them. i don't immediately assume newer is better. i think a diversity of structures is healthiest for a neighborhood.

however, i also think private citizens should have a solid amount of freedom with their properties. because i'm in the market for a new-to-me home, i can see that newer can frequently be better or more affordable than older. i'm a big fan of modern design and architecture, and i recognize that envisioning and building "the new" is a necessary and important part of our culture.

should this building be saved?
i don't really think it's the very last cottage in lincoln park. but, i don't know for sure. is anybody counting?

i do think this little cottage is meaningful to our neighborhood. it adds to the visual diversity of our streetscapes. it maintains a dignified scale and offers authentic charm. it reminds us of our shared history.

it's almost 150 years old. it was built just 16 years after our neighborhood was incorporated into the city of chicago. according to a guide the chicago commission on landmarks publishes called your house has a history (download it here), it is a classic worker's cottage.
it would be a meaningful loss to see it go.

unfortunately, we lack a cohesive enough community to stand up and say, "hey, all you rich people buying lots and building mega-homes nearby, could you please throw this one in as a gift to your community? it's important to us. alderman daley, what about the loss of this home in our community? is that okay with you?"

maybe the rich people could donate it as a tax-write off to the chicago history museum who could use it as a study annex, sort of like the the art institute's roger brown study collection on halsted. or, maybe it could be a children's center or a garden and a small park. perhaps a retail shop might like it and extend the armitage shopping district a bit further east. any of those choices might protect it for the community to enjoy for years to come.

but, honestly, there are plenty of historians who can speak more knowledgably about this building's importance, or lack thereof, rather than me. 

my main point is that just thinking about this building's fate reveals a lot. the election already showed how little our community discusses our future. demolishing this house might reveal how little we honor our past.

here's a link to coldwellbankeronline.com where you'll need to register and type in 625 w. armitage.here's zillow, but you need to register and type in the address: 625 w. armitage.
here's my favorite lincoln park realtor.

are the cicadas the y2k story of the year?





i'm already tired of hearing about the cicadas.i can't help but wonder if it's going to be a big nothing like y2k was. you know, with global warming and all that. it's entirely possible the cicadas won't know to come out this year.the trib adores the story. this morning's front page features an article by an oh-gosh bride who had envisioned a ceremony outside. but, oh yuck. "can you imagine yelling your vows (over the sound of the bugs), waiting for something to land in your hair?" she states. "it's just so gross!"then there's the trib's sentence that tries to justify the article: "cicadas don't bite or carry diseases, but they're probably not the most welcome wedding guests."yup, at best it will be pretty remarkable and at worst mildly annoying.hold tight. one way or another this, too, shall pass. they're predicting by early july.(go here to hear what the cicadas may sound like. i must say, it's a bit startling to think it will be the soundtrack of this summer. glad i heard it now. sounds and photo courtesy of professor janet stein carter at the university of cincinnati - claremont college.)

back online: more on vi





you guys rock. thanks for all the comments blazing on my previous post while i took some more down time.just a few more comments on vi's re-election and what you've posted:- i wrote that people re-elected vi due to her leadership and experience. i really don't know that. i was just giving her the benefit of the doubt. a more accurate statement would have been that voters decided to keep her rather than fire her. the reasons are probably as numerous as the voters.- i do hope vi daley will step up her engagement communication with the community and find some innovative ways to do that. i recommend she set up a blog like my virtual friend the blogging mayor of round lake aka bill gentes. (his blog, by the way, turns 2 today! happy blogirthday, bill!)he uses his blog to keep his constituents up to date about road closings, police promotions, non-profits, election results, local merchants, and lots of other news big and small. his blog is a great example of leadership, community engagement, and how to share civic knowledge. he's even been invited to lecture on building community through blogging.just something for the folks over at vi's to begin thinking about. and,  don't forget a comments section!-i think one of the things that surprised me the most about the 43rd ward aldermanic race was how much the word "puppet" got thrown around. say what you will about any of the candidates, but i find the puppet idea just so implausible.  ridiculously beholden to someone on certain issues? influenced unduly by others? that i buy.-thank you very much to rachel goodstein and others for their kind comments about the blog.-finally, regarding our house search. it is true that most of the single family homes in our price range and with the features we are seeking are not located in lincoln park. but, i want to be absolutely clear that i am not throwing myself a pity party.i am deeply grateful for and more than satisfied by our budget. i by no means want to suggest otherwise. i am sorry, though, to possibly be leaving lincoln park. we've been very happy here.  i'm hopeful we won't end up going very far.

it's vi's victory





well, vi's victory last night was clearly decisive.  no doubt about it. while her fellow incumbents fell to their spirited opponents or clung to their seats by a thread, vi was way out ahead of michele smith.  clearly, voters felt her leadership and track record were worthy of her keeping her job.she raked in 4,347 votes to smith's 3,798 with 98.31% of the vote in. (these numbers from the trib here.)congratulations to vi and michele for an important campaign that percolated a needed discussion throughout our community. i do hope we'll continue to see smith, zelchenko, goodstein, and egan engaged and present in this community.the other interesting fact was that the number of voters who turned out was down just about 900 or so from the february election. 9143 voters turned out in february (unofficially). with 98% of the votes in, 8145 turned out for the run-off.  meanwhile, here at our ranch, our contract fell through yesterday on the house we were hoping to buy in what is now scott waguespack's ward. sigh.i'm also signing off for a while.  i need to re-group. happiness and peace to you and yours.

who has the edge? vi or michele?





the campaigning is fast and furious. e-mails from tim egan. post-it notes on my front yard gate from vi daley. neighbors from old town mailing on behalf of michele smith.are you planning on voting tomorrow?i am one of those people who shows up at just about every election no matter what. i believed all that stuff in elementary school about how other countries wished they had a right to vote like we do so we should take advantage of it. i like thinking about all the women who fought so hard for my right to vote less than a century ago. who am i not to turn out after they worked so hard and endured so much?i'm wondering if the day will favor vi and the status quo or will michele supporters be more motivated to show up at the polls?what will be will be. can't wait to see.update: here is a timeline of women's suffrage in the u.s., which should be spelled sufferage, shouldn't it? it took 144 years for women to get the right to vote. now, are you telling me, ladies, that you're too busy to get out tomorrow and vote for one of two female candidates  just 77 years later? i sure as heck hope not.

where the hell have i been?





well, here's a hint. mr. the place where we live and i have been out having a blast of the "wish you were here" variety.we also signed a contract on a home in a ward other than the fighting 43rd. it's a consuming process with inspections and all that, so i've missed a few of the main (in) fights and televisiony things going on between michele smith & vi daley.what have you heard lately? who won the tv debate?is michele buying too many drinks and breaking all kinds of rules? is vi just too entrenched with her cronies to ever ask her community what it thinks?  have you early voted?can either candidate use the word "lies" any more often without needing to buy a vowel?stay tuned. we're baaaack.update: i should probably clarify that this isn't really a picture of us. i would never marry a guy who would wear a necklace like that.

43rd ward election run-off: the calm before the storm





before tpwwl heads out on spring break (totally, dudes), here is the latest in the 43rd aldermanic run-off that pits incumbent vi daley against michele smith. see you in april!ms. smith rung the bell of my home while out canvasing the neighborhood. she was kind enough to share her opinions about her positions and fill me in on the latest news from the campaign front as she sees it. somewhere in the midst of the conversation, my two-year old daughter, who i was holding in my arms, stuck both fingers in her ears while ms. smith was talking. it was like a page out of politician training 101. mom was mortified. the candidate was diplomatic. the daughter thought she was very, very funny. mark your calendards now for april 9. vi daley and michelle smith will appear on channel 11's chicago tonight. this is great news as i think vi daley did herself a real disservice by avoiding the show during the first go-round. good for her for stepping up to the plate. this opportunity will serve the community well, and i'm guessing it will be the only opportunity for voters to see the candidate's side-by-side. my new favorite high school student in the ward, jake cp, who is chairman and host of jake's chicago politics, has endorsed michele smith for alderman. jake formerly backed tim egan, but did not join him when egan threw his support to vi daley. he's my new favorite high school student, not because of who he's endorsing (remember, i'm truly neutral in this race), but because it's just so exciting to see someone his age get knee-deep into his local politics. here's the youtube link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp_a8jvoxmg enjoy.inside lincoln park reports that smith received the endorsement of the ivi-ipo organization and the fraternal order of police, chicago, lodge #7 meanwhile, an abbreviated version of tim egan's letter endorsing vi daley without the bill kurtis murder part (which i've previously posted here), arrived in the mail on vi daley letterhead with egan's name on the envelope. my in-box has been pretty quiet from team vi. other than an invite to join her team for to march in the st. patrick's day, i don't have any other updates for you. please post if you know of some.

st. patrick left these at the field museum





from the american memory collection of the chicago daily news. the archive description reads: "four irish relics related to st. patrick on a table in the field museum in the loop community area in chicago, illinois. 1907."he probably put them in the coat check while he was looking at the dinosaurs, and then, when he got back to ireland, he found the stub in his wallet and went, "oh, jeez."

coming soon: ruffled smoked salmon & a helluva mortgage





lucien lagrange, the architect whom i've described previously (here) as a french man right out of central casting, will be hosting a preview of his newest project at 2520 n. lakeview on thursday, march 29 from 4 - 8 p.m.is it possible to measure the mortgage by the menu? you tell me:ruffled smoked salmon on black rye breadminted cucumber creme fraiche and fresh mint medium rare breast of duck with yellow tomato relish in petite cranberry muffingrilled zucchini rouladetomato scallion compote and chevre cheesebrie and apricot in phyllo flowerbeef on petite rolls with wasabi saucephyllo spinach triangles with bearnaise dipalmond tuilles, fresh fruit tartlets, petite chocolate eclairs, lemon squares, chocolate carmel finger brownies, and petite black bottom cakes with ganache rosetteso, hmmm, let's see, you take the petite beef rolls with wasabi sauce divide them by the number of phyllos add to it the number of fruit tartlets squared and, my friends, i think you're gonna see starting prices around $2 mil.'tis a shame i won't be in town to attend. but, you can. go here to sign up.[note to 2520 developers ricker-murphy, i don't think mr. lagrange capitalizes the first "g" in his last name per his company's website here. you may want to fix that on your website.]

tim egan: bill kurtis tried to get me killed, in my heart i know vi is the right choice, and other tales from the 43rd ward aldermanic front





tim egan e-mailed his statement about why he will be endorsing vi daley in the run-off. he entitled it, "a vision for the future."he writes:there is much to be said after experiencing the eye of the storm view in a campaign for alderman in the city of chicago. educational is the first word i would use to describe two years plus on the âchicago stump.â secondly, but most important, is the great pride in the hard work and dedication of so many supporters, family and friends. there was some bitter disappointment in commitments promised and not delivered, but that was outweighed by the outright hilarity in some things that came our way.one of my favorite memories is when the chicago legend bill kurtis tried to get me killed. the famed news anchor and incredible voice and i were at the center for performing arts fundraiser several months ago along with about 300 others waiting in the hallway for the arrival of mayor daley.as usual the mayorâs advance team arrived to secure the room and looked the full professional part with wired earphones and trench coats in place. it was the first time i had ever met mr. kurtis but was happy to have a conversation about the campaign, given he is a 43rd ward constituent.then he tried to get me killed.mr. kurtis suggested that the best way to get a picture with the mayor and be on the front page of the newspapers was to âlungeâ at him as he walked by. because mr. kurtisâ voice is mesmerizing i didnât catch his direction at first and then it hit me, he was trying to get me clipped by those real looking, gun carrying bodyguards.i mentioned that a person my size lunging anywhere near the mayor would not be around the next day to run for anything and seriously hoped mr. kurtis was kidding. that guy has the straightest face in tv history and i really couldnât tell.anywayâ¦our campaign team presented a positive acton platform that was drowned out by a forest pillaging negative tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. where are the environmentalist endorsements when you need them?as much as i long for cheap shot politics to be abolished, itâs unfortunately here to stay. as the only aldermanic candidate in the city of chicago to attend the campaign for political reform luncheon with former illinois state senator peter fitzgerald, i also keep my hopes up that massive campaign financing reforms will come to fruition sometime before then next turn of the century. spending over $250,000 for an aldermanic seat is ludicrous and massive reform city, state and countrywide is so necessary.the spending frenzy, especially the bashing of opponents in my opinion is an insult to everyoneâs intelligence and something our campaign stayed very far away from.in the end, we did alright and i want to thank our troops who were the highlight of the entire campaign. we had help from 43rd ward residents, lincoln park chamber of commerce members, family, friends and as much silent support as you can garner in chicago. we played it straight and stayed above the usual political idiocy and tried to pound home our positive action message. it did garner support withalmost 1,100 voters and i am thankful to each and every one of them.the big question on the minds who are interested in the 43rd ward about who i would support was answered by abc tv on friday, march 9th at 5 pm. my support for alderman vi daley comes down to two simple truths. i polled some of our most ardent and dedicated supporters in the most democratic fashion possible and an overwhelming majority will be voting for alderman daley. in my heart, i know that vi is the right choice for the next four years in ourward. i have full faith vi daley will represent my supporters, my family and myself in the city council. vi has served two terms as 43rd ward alderman and two terms as chief of staff to a former 43rd ward alderman. she has been in the ward for over 30 solid years and i have confidence in her knowledge of the system.while her administration has had the shock of not garnering more than 50% of the popular vote, i believe vi will make the steps necessary to increase communication and improve her constituent service plan in the next four years.after spending time with michele smith at community forums, tv & radio interviews and on the streets of the 43rd ward campaigning, i can honestly say from my heart that she did not earn my vote. as i head to the polling place and cast my vote for vi in april, it is because in my opinion her campaign did not lay positive ground work on behalf of the residents of the 43rd ward.smith has offered critizicism of the lincoln park chamber of commerce, but never joined as a member. she has guaranteed no future high rise development on the childrenâs memorial site as complete campaign rhetoric. she has promoted her support for the 7% tax cap, but so did all of the candidates and vi has been championing that cause for years. who wouldnât?most importantly, parts of the 43rd ward truly reflect a village within the city. and the negative campaigning and lack of positive ideas does not lend itself to a very village like atmosphere.no deals where made and my hands were not washed by any other hands, which will be automatic assumptions. hey, i just paid another round of parking tickets that we were tagged with during the last few weeks. so no free passes have been granted. voting for vi is my choice and the choice of my family.as for my future, youâll hear from me again as i have promised my supporters. my candidacy was for the purest reasons and those reasons have not changed. i am definitely looking forward."

egan throws support behind daley in run-off





abc channel 7 reports here that tim egan is backing vi daley in the run-off.  hmmmm. vi's reaction as quoted in the article:"i met with him and i think he ran a good campaign and he has some ideas that i will be working with him on."opponent michele smith's reaction as quoted in the article:"the overwhelming majority of the voters voted for change. they responded to our campaign because it was about the issues, about development, property taxes, waste."no statement per egan's site. egan backers, will you, too, be backing daley in the run-off?

lynn becker: "the farwell is toast"





lynn becker reports here that the farwell will be gutted. he writes,"in a a dazzling display of raw political power and overwhelming self-deception, the society for the protection of wealthy developers, formerly known as the ommission on chicago landmarks, voted this morning to demolish the landmark farwell building on north michigan and remount the surviving elements of its facade on a new structure.voting in favor the motion were chairman david mosena, john baird, lori healey, lisa willis, ernest c. wong, phyllis ellin, christopher r. reed and ben weese. the sole commissioner not to drink the kool-aid and voting no was edward i. torrez. the other commissioners kept repeating the mantra of "this is not a precedent. this is not a precedent" as if trying to convince themselves that it could actually be true."

press 1 if you plan to vote for vi daley. (so we can hit you up for some form of support and maybe ignore you.)





press 2 if you plan to vote for michele smith. (so we can write you off.)press 3 if you are undecided. (so we can work on you.)press 4 if you are not planning to vote in the election. (so we can ignore you.)when "the machine" quite literally called today, the robo voice identified herself as being with vi's campaign. after i pressed 3, i was disconnected.  no smoozy "goodbye" or "thank you." just a genuine click.this can't be that effective for them, can it? really, what are they going to do with information if it's not what i've described above? there are two registered voters in our household. how do they know who they're talking to? how do they know six-year olds aren't responding?

no word from tim egan's camp - fyi





although tim expected to make a statement on monday about his intentions for the run-off, i'm guessing that life has intervened and he's taking the time he needs to be with his family right now. or, perhaps he's mulling over how he'd like to proceed. maybe both.i'm sure he'll let us know what's up when he's good and ready.update: here's the march 5 statement from tim's campaign site, but that does not overtly state his plans. anonymous, who posted about tim's plans, obviously believes s/he knows something i don't. that, of course, is entirely possible.3.5.07dear 43rd ward supporters & friends,the experience of running for 43rd ward alderman over the last two years plus has been more than wonderful, it has brought me friendships that will last a lifetime.we all have great memories that will also last a lifetime.i was prompted to run for alderman by neighbors, friends and family because they believed my hospital administration and community service background would be perfect for the office. my run had the purest intentions and although the outcome was less than perfect for our team, we are energized by the positives.we put out an army throughout our campaign; an army made up of 43rd ward residents, business associates, charitable organization friends and even those i played sports with and against. more importantly, our team was bolstered by my family. more cannot be said about the support of the dedication shown by my wife marlena. i could not ask for a better partner, mother to my children and friend.then there are my brothers. we three irish siblings have lived up to legend by being the best of friends and the toughest of opponents. but true heart was displayed at the 2626 n. lakeview polling place throughout the day on tuesday, feb. 27th.my 44 year old brother terry played the roll of poll watcher for our team and did a great job keeping an eye on things. three weeks ago he was diagnosed with parkinson's disease and my family thought it best to keep it from me during the election. my brother, facing the abyss of a disease with no proven cure, worked like a champion.heart, as i've said, is the greatest of life's characteristics and with my brother in the lead our campaign showed plenty. there are many "thanks" to be passed around and they belong to those who stuffed envelopes, made phone calls, labeled, placed door hangers, hit the streets and so much more.our "team" and our "army" were unmatched, from friends who helped financially and to those who dedicated much of their free time; i owe them all a ton of gratitude.and to the almost 1,100 voters who believed in our message and our vision for the future,"thank you!"that said, we're not done. my heart is dedicated to community service and my hope is for great things to come in the 43rd ward. please keep in touch and keep visiting our website, we're keeping it going and we'll keep promoting safety and community involvement.thanks once again and i look forward to seeing all of you throughout the run-off election in april and at all the 43rd ward neighborhood functions right around the corner. see you soon.tim

ideas about place (and travel): wendy mcclure





i stumbled across i'm not the new me at the brown elephant thrift store recently. it's a memoir, and i adore it.it's written by fellow chicagoan wendy mcclure, who blogs at a site called pound. the book, to her enormous credit, grew out of the blog. she writes about her struggle to lose weight in a snarky world that expects it of her. chicago is her backdrop. here's an excerpt that reveals a bit of her thoughts about this place:"we're taking the chicago skyway out. the road vaults up to the skyway bridge that takes us over calumet city, over barges and water treatment plants and electrical towers and big tanks of god knows what. we have to roll up the windows when we cross over into indiana, through hammond and gary. the first hour of any trip east from chicago takes you through panoramic swaths of industrial stuff, all of it ugly, all hell, and we love it. it makes indiana into an epic."i love that stretch in a weird way, too. it kind of reminds me of pittsburgh. my grandfather worked in the steel mills there, and the ugliness of that industry had an inexplicable, captivating charm. of course, that could be the nostalgia talking.but, it did seem that any moment while driving around there, we might stumble across a mysterious passage. i imagined it would lead to the enormous pot of molten steel my grandfather used to talk about. one time, he said, a man fell in, and they had to bury the entire pot because his body would never be found and the steel would never be any good.[other fave memoirs of late: eat, pray, love and the glass castle.]

lynn becker: bid farewell to the farwell after all?





lynn becker tracks the continuing saga of the stripping of the farwell building's landmark status in favor of a parking lot here.it's not surprising that the win earlier this year by preservationists was tentative at best. it's back on the docket for this thursday.interested citizens can attend or send an e-mail to the deputy commissioner as outlined below.unfortunately, lynn's post was written the day before alderman burton natarus was ousted by brendan reilly in the municipal election. does anyone know how reilly feels about the proposal on the farwell?one of tpwwl's readers forwarded the meeting scoop as such:please attend the meeting on thursday or please send an email to deputycommissioner, brian goeken at bgoeken@cityofchicago.orgcommission on chicago landmarks â special meeting farwell building thursday, march 8, 2007 9:00 a.m.(please be early to sign in to speak)cook county commission board room118 n. clark street, 5th floor (eastelevators)chicago, illinois read tpwwl's coverage of the last commission on chicago landmarks meeting here.photo borrowed from lynn becker's blog, architecturechicago plus

tim egan: "family news has put this election in clear perspective"





sad news from the egan camp.i received this earlier today in response to my inquiry for a post-election statement or comment.  (i am in the process of e-mailing all the candidates for statements/responses should they care to share them.)  i was certainly sorry to hear this news and wish tim and his family well. expect to hear a statement from him on monday.tim wrote,"the aftermath has been extremely difficult for my family and not because we lost the race. we have had some devastating family news that was held back from me during the election. strength and courage is what i respect most in life. and while the news is heartbreaking, what has happened and how my family is dealing with it is a profile in courage.understandably we are all several steps behind our usual clear communications and timely responses.i have also stopped many of our supporters from posting blogs on your site that deal with the stupidity of anonymous posters. plant? half baked? it's astounding that people would make comments with no base and be coward enough to do so anonymously. these false accusations are a profile in cowardice. trust me, i am the most easily accessible of all the candidates, i beg for the anonymous to make themselves known and contact me directly. i would love to have one-on-one meetings that quell any ridiculous accusations. for the record i've had as many face-to-face meetings with marty oberman as i have with peter o'brien... all of which got me nowhere with the two "machines".this very personal family news has put this election in clear perspective. at the appropriate time, i will release a statement on the place where we live. it will explain who i am backing and why. until then, tell your bloggers if they want to take cheap shots, i'm still answering 312.714.4409 and i will be glad to carve out some time to interface.sincerely,tim"note: do not even think of posting any comment that is not kind and considerate. i will delete you and turn the comments off. i should add that i had his permission to share this.

the dawn clark netsch bean post





i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to read the comments on this post on peter zelchenko's 43rd ward blog before tuesday's election, but the discussion by some of vi daley's campaign staff and the ward-oriented debate are still of note.

michele smith says "thanks for your support!"





here is the statement from michele smith's campaign. i received it earlier today, but i've been out."dear friends,thank you for your support! we are very excited about the election results. because of your support, we forced the incumbent into a run-off election on april 17. i would like to thank tim egan, rachel goodstein, and peter zelchenko for running strong campaigns. they showed up at the forums, knocked on doors, held coffees and shared their views with residents of the ward. because of their efforts, the ward will be a better place to live. in a multi-candidate race, a candidate must have a simple majority of 50% plus one vote in order to win outright, or the top two finishers participate in a run-off election. we made a very strong second-place showing, and the current incumbent received less than 50%. as a result, i'll be running as the only candidate against the incumbent on tuesday, april 17, 2007. get involved! contribute!our supporters are energized. there's clearly a mandate for change in this ward and i am eager to continue my campaign to give residents a true and decisive advocate in this community and in city hall. get involved! volunteer! after more than 8 years in office, the incumbent has failed to win the confidence of the majority of residents in the 43rd ward. i look forward to debating the issues with mrs. daley during the next phase of this campaign. thank you again for all that you do. sincerely, michele smith"very interesting. smith is claiming a mandate for change while identifying daley as an alderman who failed to win the confidence of the majority of voters. the tone of daley's letter vs. smith's was pretty striking to me -- the old guard vs. the potential new one.let the games begin!
