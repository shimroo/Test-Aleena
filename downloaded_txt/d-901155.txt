welcome to nixon's marine inc.
welcome to nixon’s marine, a trusted source for all your fishing boat needs. we understand that your boat’s performance has a big effect on your fishing experience: whether you are a competitive tournament angler, fish to relax on the weekends, love to tow the kids around on the water or all three. come check out are new skeeter, vexus, caymas, river hawk and crestliner brands plus a large selection of used boats. we also carry motorguide and minnkota trolling motors, power-poles and lowrance electronics as well as a large assortment of tackle. if you choose one of the boats in our large used inventory, we will fully service the boat; looking for any problems that need to be fixed before you take it home. we want to make sure that you can take the boat straight from our store to the water. buying a used boat from nixon’s marine has its advantages. if you are looking for a specific boat and don’t see one like it listed, please give us a call as new and used inventory is continuously coming in and there are always boats on the lot that haven’t quite made it to the website yet.
