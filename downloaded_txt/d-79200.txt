  great anniversary trip! i was a novice and not particularly athletic but their guides and private river access made it easy for this 63 year old grandma to try something new like fly fishing. loved my first experience and you will too!

  an almost indescribable experience -i just spent 4 nights and 3 days fishing at the north fork ranch in shawnee, co. everything was perfect. the facilities and scenery are beautiful. the food is out of this world. the ranch owners and staff were friendly, helpful and just plain outstanding. additionally, i used the north fork ranch guide service guides and also found the guides outstanding professionals who really know their waters and fish.

  had a great experience on my fishing guided tour. was my first experience fly fishing and was able to catch multiple fish, shocking myself! the guide was friendly, knowledgeable and patient while i caught trees and rocks, we had a fun day of fishing. i have visited the ranch multiple times and the staff is all incredible as well as the food and accommodations. had recently broke my ankle and staff made it possible for me to still participate. i didn’t know fishing could be so fun.

  my friend and i have done a lot of fishing over the decades, but never fast water fly fishing and i didn't really know what to expect. as it turned out, we simply could not have come to a better place to learn. our field guides, kaleb and shannah, were just spectacular in being able to instruct and sharing their incredible knowledge of the sport. all while attending to my friend and i to net fish and keep us fishing (kaleb chased the huge rainbow in the pictures below over two rapids before netting it). ralph gave us a class on the basics that covered everything and he continued to give tips and encouragement for the whole weekend. meanwhile, the nfr lodge provides comfortable accommodations with good food and top notch hospitality. the back porch is just a few steps from the river. in short, we had a wonderful time and will be back next year!
