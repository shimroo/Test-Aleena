michael cooley
president/ceo, the sportsman channel




“the pre-hunt communications, logistics, quantity & quality of game and the guide, equipment, food and accommodation were all excellent. gary took great care of our moose and the hunt was exactly as we were told it would be. i had great time with my son and would recommend tha to my friends. you can use me as a reference and i will certainly hunt with tha on my next hunt in alberta.”



pete p.
bozeman, mt




“this was the complete package with alternate options that led to success. the hunt was even better, much better than purported in pre-hunt communications. tha is a great organization with great guides and great support and i’ll be back for my 4th tha hunt next year. as great as tha is, they are always striving to improve as evidenced this year by introducing a wonderful new local guide. an extra thrill was being able to hunt with the head of tha, peter brill. he was as great in the field as he is as an organizer. and he serves fine wine. thanks again for everything.”



jim b.
fairbanks, ak




“brett is a great guide. great trip! covered miles of beautiful country and saw 100+ deer the first day. took a great mule deer at sunset. perfect hunt!”



craig m.
northampton, ma




“my 4th straight mule deer hunt with tha and my 4th beautiful mule deer. it doesn’t get any better than this. my guide, dennis, is the best guide i have ever hunted with and i have hunted worldwide. as a team, we are too tough to stop and i’m already booked for next year. my advice to anyone contemplating a hunt with tha is “book early & book often”. as always, i would be pleased to be a reference for tha. “



jim b.
fairbanks, ak




“i have never met such a professional group of people in my life. everything was excellent and the host family was so giving to me. the hunt was as purported in pre-hunt communications and there were no surprises. i would recommend tha to anyone looking for a great mule deer hunt. i am very much looking forward to returning. i would be pleased to be a reference for tha.”

“randy was a pleasure to be around, relentless and tenacious in trying lots of strategies to get me a shot at a big one. he is a bowhunter himself and knows the terrain, land owners, and the game. i strongly recommend him. after 6 repeat hunts, what more can i say.”



jim b.
fairbanks, ak




“great time! 3 mile stalk, 500 yard crawl, 300 yard shot, beautiful!”



david a.
north pole, ak




“everything was excellent, or better than excellent and was as described prior to the hunt. the quantity and quality of the mule deer was superb as was our guide, accommodation & food. the winds were strong and difficult to get used to but they did allow us to target, and sneak in on, specific coulees that held animals. you can use me as a reference and on my return to alberta, i’ll book with tha.”

ken m.
montrose, co




“i don’t think i could hope to get as big as a moose over the rest of my life! the moose hunt was great. we saw lots of animals and i go back with an awesome trophy. darrell (the guide) knowledge of the moose hunting is profound, and he knows his territory like the back of his hand – great!”



j.f. c.
