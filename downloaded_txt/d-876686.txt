come play yogachildren are encouraged to "play" yoga and experience how their breath and body move together in a fun-filled way! 



























our programour program promotes inner-strength, confidence and self-esteem; a feeling of well-being and respect for others; and, love for one's self, inside and out.














the karma kids philosophysharing yoga with children provides them with a variety of  tools that they can take away from yoga class and use throughout their lives. animals, nature and other objects come alive in our classes; as we move, we learn to stretch our bodies in new creative ways. through basic and challenging poses, partner poses, group poses, yoga games, mindfulness activities, music and stories, we promote strength, flexibility, coordination, physical and emotional balance. challenges promote confidence, focus and body awareness.  breathing and visualization techniques teach concentration, self-regulation, relaxation and self-control.  we continuously plant seeds of kindness, empathy, compassion, collaboration, community and self love.
















better togetherwhile our programs encourage your little ones, we also have special opportunities for you to work together.  family yoga offers  playful partner poses and activities for bonding and connection in a fun-filled way!  we also offer parenting workshops in mindfulness and for easing stress.
