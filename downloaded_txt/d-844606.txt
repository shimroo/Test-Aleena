					sunday, february 16				

we continue our epiphany worship series – be a lamp, a ladder, or a lifeboat… leave your house every day like a shepherd. the worship series is based on the quote by rumi.
theme: sometimes a shepherd says, “woe”	
scripture: luke 6:17-26 and psalm 1
hybrid worship – both in-person at the church and online via zoom and facebook.

2025 annual stewardship campaign

we will steward our natural god-given curiosity. accept invitations. explore new places. get to know different people. and when the spirit within us is piqued… trust that prompting is from the lord, and get exited to not only imagine, but experience, where we will be led during the 2025 annual stewardship campaign. please consider giving to our campaign, so that either your pledge (click the orange button below) and/or donation (click donate at the top of our homepage) will help cucc continue our many ministries and the work we do for our surrounding community.
