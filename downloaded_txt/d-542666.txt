the growing craft cocktail scene for her blog, caroline on crack. she went on to garner accolades such as la weekly’s “best bar blogger” and “blog post of the year” and was recruited to further cover the city’s bars and bartenders for online publications, such as eater and liquor, and print magazines, such as los angeles magazine where she was the drinks editor. now she’s living her dream as the digital content editor for imbibe magazine and author of margarita time (ten speed press).top postsfeb 3, 2025how it started: julep houstonimbibenov 20, 2024the 22 best cocktail bars in los
