about us 



nepsac was established in 1942 as an organization of athletic directors from accredited new england independent schools. while the association does not function as a regulatory or oversight body (like the ncaa or state public high school associations), nepsac does sanction new england championship events in many sports and provides guidance in a variety of issues involving interscholastic athletics in our schools.
