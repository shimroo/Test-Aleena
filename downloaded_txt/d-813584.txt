established 1973
akron auto auction: a legacy of trust and excellence







 we are proud to celebrate over 50 years of vehicle remarketing at akron auto auction
                           







                           founded in 1945, akron auto auction has grown from a modest operation into a major industry player, now spanning 30 acres with six auction lanes. originally located on east avenue, the business moved to its current location on ley drive in 1979, evolving significantly under various ownerships and management teams. today, it not only offers large-scale auto auctions but also features a comprehensive facility including a cafeteria, multiple offices, and a reconditioning shop. now helmed by the third generation of the founding family, akron auto auction maintains a strong community focus, treating customers like family and fostering a supportive work environment for over 230 employees.
