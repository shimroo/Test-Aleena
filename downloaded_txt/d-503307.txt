welcome to the woman's national democratic club. the woman's national democratic club (wndc) is a hub for civic engagement, learning, and political action in the heart of the nation's capital. 
the club is a meeting place for democrats, independents, and progressives to come together to protect and promote our democratic values. we continue our legacy of serving as a forum for our community to engage in conversation and action to advance shared political interests.
