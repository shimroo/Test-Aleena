shapes of things and géométrie
1 may 2023



the second entry in the new zeitgeist collection, géométrie is full of surprises. 
	    it's sort of a modernist reinterpretation of the traditional virginia/oriental mixture in plug form. it's got great 
	    aging potential, but because of the pressing, it exhibits a wonderfully deep and mature flavor even in its youth. 
	    notes of freshly baked bread, a subtle malty sweetness, and hints of baking spices and delicate floral notes emerge 
	    from the combination of the virginias and oriental leaf. 
	  
when i first saw the plugs in their final form, i was reminded of the proto-cubist movement, which
	    inspired the artistic direction of the label. the name came out of a stream-of-consciousness word salad when i was
	    talking about it with a friend. the french spelling is because france was the birthplace of cubism, and as a quiet wink
	    to renã© descartes. finally, it's lower case because i think it looks cool, and because i've always kind of liked 
	    e.e. cummings...
	  
slice it
	    thick or thin; rub it out fully, or leave it coarse. i've been experimenting with cutting a slice 2-3mm thick, about 
	    3/32", then cross cutting it into cubes and gravity filling the bowl. or, making sort of "matchsticks" that
	    are cut to length to fit the bowl, and stacked vertically with a little twist. both are great ways to enjoy this one. 
	    and, for some bowls, finely shaved and rubbed out to a shag works wonderfully.
	  
from the label:

          	overlapping planes of vintage, sun-cured basma and izmir leaf reframe the malty, natural sweetness of 
		mature red virginias in this modern expression of the classical virginia/oriental archetype. aged in 
		cakes to deepen and enrich the flavors, this structured, plug-cut tobacco is poised to engage and intrigue 
		all of the senses.
            
at every phase, this has been a really fun project, and the final result exceeds my expectations in every way. early
	    reviews have been very positive as well. i hope you enjoy géométrie as much as i have enjoyed 
	    creating it.
          
géométrie was released in april, 2023.
announcing bankside
8 november 2022



inaugurating my new zeitgeist collection, a range of tobaccos designed to celebrate the often 
             avant-garde and rebellious themes of the modern era, bankside is a strikingly modernist reinterpretation 
             of the archetypal virginia/perique 
             flake. from a bold, traditional canvas of red and bright virginias and genuine st. james perique emerge subtle, 
             contrasting strokes of dark-fired kentucky and cypriot latakia tobaccos, originating exotic, smoky undertones that 
             support and enrich notes of sweet cream and the virginia's citrusy tang.
		  
i've been tasting the final prototype for over a year, and absolutely loving it. it's proved itself for great aging potential, and 
             i'm sure it will deliver well into the next decade. the early reviews have been fantastic, and i'm very excited about 
             this one. it's now released and in general availability, so should be on your 
             favorite retailer's shelves. enjoy!
          
there's a really nice piece by chuck stanion

set your sails for windjammer
5 february 2021



i've been thinking about this one for a long time. rich, full, flavorful and satisfying, with just a bit
            of sweetness, and enough complexity to keep it interesting from first light to last puff. presented in a cut-cake
            style to allow preparing it to suit both the smoker's choice and the weather. why windjammer? the nautical
            theme seemed right for a slow burning blend that can be enjoyed both at home and at sea. plus, i just liked the name, 
            and it charted the way for some killer art... 
          
from the label:

          	a rich and satisfying cut cake comprising sweet, ripe virginias, nutty burleys, unflavored toasted black cavendish, 
          	and a generous measure of perique. a splash of dark rum ties it all together, and adds a bit more sweetness. 
          	as you enjoy this slow, clean burning flake, youâll find hints of cocoa, black walnuts, and dried fruits enhancing 
          	complex, natural tobacco goodness. full on the palate, with a delightful aroma. enjoy smooth sailing with windjammer.
          
i've been exploring the prototypes for a few months, and the final product is exactly what i was chasing. it's been 
            a fun journey, as it always is, and i hope you'll love it as much as i do.

revving up for spark plug
17 january 2020



this has been something of a dream project for me, and i'm happy to say that it's on its way. spark plug
            is the latest blend to find a home in my heirloom series. 
          
here's what the label will tell you:

          	deep and dark. powerful yet refined. the smoky, leathery backdrop of latakia 
          	is layered with an almost incense-like spice of rich orientals, with fine virginias 
          	added for depth and a subtle sweetness. like the classic roadsters that inspired its 
          	creation, spark plug has an alluring charm that invites you to rev it up and take it 
          	out for long drives in the country. sliced thick or thin, it will never leave you stranded.
          
i've been smoking prototypes for nearly a year, and am absolutely loving the final product. as always,
             working with jeremy at c&d has been a pure and effortless joy, and calvin has
             my often impenetrable design briefs and transformed my concept into the wonderul label
             seen above. my deepest gratitude and appreciation goes out to these guys for their continued 
             willingness to work with whacky ideas and make them a reality.
           
spark plug is available now. get some from your favorite retailer, and get ready to start your engines!
announcing penny farthing shag cut
10 july 2019



i'm really excited to finally be able to announce this one, my first new release in nearly two years.
            penny farthing is the first shag cut
            to be presented in the range, and it's taken a long time to get this one just right, including the cut. it's
            a true shag, about 32 cuts per inch, blended from bright and red virginias, spiced with louisiana perique 
            and a hint of fire-cured dark kentucky. it's easy to pack, and easy to smoke, 
            opening with a sophisticated sweetness, and evolving in depth and complexity throughout the bowl 
            to a rich, satisfying finish. because of the fine cut, it can burn fast if you really want it to, but 
            taking your time, sipping 
            gently, will offer the best reward, allow the flavors to fully develop. 
          
just released - regents flake and temple bar
12 july 2016



i've been working on these two for a couple of years, and am thoroughly pleased with the results. they're similar 
          to one another, but also very different, and the differences make them fun to explore together. these are pure
          tobaccos, free from casings, added sugars or flavorings of any kind. and, as with
          all my blends, theyll age beautifully in the tins.
          
regents flake starts as a base of red and bright virginia leaf, seasoned with generous amounts of
          fine oriental tobaccos. a very small percentage of perique is added to enhance the fruitiness of the virginias,
          as well as to work its magic amplifying some of the lovely exotic, almost floral qualities of the orientals. 
          pressing and aging in cakes brings out the best of the leaf, after which the blocks are cut and sliced into
          flakes. the aroma is rich, malty, fruity and just a little earthy. in the bowl, beautiful virginia flavors,
          subtly sweet, are enhanced by the spice and sweet/tart character of the orientals, and the room note 
          is wonderful.
          
          temple bar is made from the same components, but optimized for presentation as a plug. 
          (temple bar. see what i did there?) sliced across the grain, thick or thin, and rubbed out
          to your preferred texture, the taste can go from subtle to intense, with a similar flavor profile to 
          regents flake, though somewhat more fruity from the added fermentation that takes place within
          the plug.
during the final stages of development, i smoked these in every sort of pipe i could think of - 
          briars, cobs, clays, meerschaums and even calabashes - with a wide variety of bowl geometries, trying to 
          find what worked best, and what didn't. as expected, different pipes delivered different results,
          but i couldn't find anything that i'd consider "better" than anything else. in fact the converse, more
          importantly, was true, and i really enjoyed it in 
          everything i smoked it in, though the calabash (a real one, with a large gourd) muted the flavors somewhat. 
          and, yes, they're really delicious in a cob.
these were released for general availability today, and should be on 
          your favorite glp retailer's shelves by the time you read this.
