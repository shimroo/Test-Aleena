“create, i say!an eye will widenbecause of it.”










 

melody and lyric; rhyme and poetic rhythm--tools in the creative mind and hand of chris rice, whose 20 years of love songs and songs of faith continue to deeply move listeners around the world, 

 




 

 




“mine is a life inspired by the beauty and color of nature, the contemplation of god, and the humor tucked into small everyday moments. driven to communicate all of this through creative means, i am overwhelmed by the privilege, and happy to find my work reaching so many people in meaningful ways.”

— chris
