we offer the most advanced line of easily installed dock floats with the maximum lift capacity for the waterfront resident, boaters, and marinas. our floats are constructed of thick-walled rotationally molded polyethylene shell that encapsulates expanded polystyrene - the finest flotation material.
the thick polyethylene shell is impact resistant and will also resist damage from marine life. the expanded polystyrene has 1–1.5 lb. density and will pass a 5% maximum absorption test. the thick walled plastic float case is packed with eps that is environmentally approved and exceeds all new government regulations.










ramps
we build the finest aluminum floating docks, and walkways available. they are fabricated from marine grade aluminum combining both superb engineering and materials for extended durability.
our not only feature rugged construction, but a finely sculpted design.
using first quality decking, our ramps are not only more secure in their footing, but they are quieter. this ideal blending of materials creates an aesthetically pleasing effect guaranteed to delight you for years to come.
