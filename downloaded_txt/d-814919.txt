they called themselves knights of columbus...
in 1882, father michael j. mcgivney conceived the idea of an organization of catholic men who would band together. knights to emphasize chivalry’s ideals of charity and support for church and state, and columbus as a reminder that catholics had been the backbone and bulwark of america’s growth and greatness from the very beginning. kofc has grown into a global organization of more than 2+ million members in nearly 16,000 local councils world wide and 300 college councils.
