											hiking trails maine – try hiking to the top of mount katahdin.
									 	

hiking trails maine – mt. katahdin
if you want the premier of hiking trails maine, hike the trail up mount katahdin (elev. 5,267 feet), a difficult climb of 4,000 feet. the mountain marks the terminus of the appalachian trail, and the beginning of the international appalachian trail that runs into canada. it's a beautiful location in the wilds of maine, a great spot for spying wildlife as well as exploring maine's beautiful pine woods. 
 you'll have to pay to enter baxter state park, where the trailhead lies, unless you live in maine. the park is in the millinocket area, and offers many other hiking trails if you're not into the difficulty of reaching the top of maine's highest peak. try the hikes to chimney pond or fowler brook if you're looking for less strenuous trails.

											hiking in new hampshire sounds like it's all about mountain climbing. are their other hikes, too?
									 	

hiking in new hampshire
for many people, hiking in new hampshire is all about scaling the many peaks of the white mountains. one of the most popular hikes in the state takes hikers to the top of mount washington. most trail reviews say it's not an easy hike, so only attempt it if you're in the best of share. there are some steep areas, and the alpine area is rocky and difficult. 
 other hiking in new hampshire isn't quite so demanding. for example, the welch-dickey loop is only 4.5 miles long, and a short drive from boston. you can hike to the top of either welch or dickey peak, but the loop between them offers great views. it is a steep hike in places, but the views are worth it.
