what are creation safaris?
creation safaris (tm), now celebrating our 34th year, can take you to unusual and beautiful places where you can have fun, fellowship and worship god while enjoying the great outdoors. and while you’re at it, you will learn important evidence for creation and against evolution.















whatever you are looking for…
we have the information you need. a.w.e. stands for…



























adventure

star parties. cave exploring. whale watching. river rafting. day hikes. road trips. backpacking trips. camping trips. museums. bike rides. beach trips. all these and more have been activities on creation safaris. we offer something for everybody – young and old, weak or strong, timid or daring. if you want to participate, here’s where to start. look at our photos and videos of safaris past, then check our calendar of upcoming safaris. events are rated easy to hard (we recommend starting easy), and can be long or
short. we also provide a map of like-minded ministries across the usa.
































worship

want to start an outdoor education ministry? we have the resources to help you begin. from decades of experience leading events of all kinds, creation safaris has gathered information that can help “sell” the benefits of outdoor education and show you how to do it. read our essays on “why the church must emphasize creation” and “why creation safaris?” to get motivated. then explore our videos and photos to see how we implemented the values of worship “outside the building” in god’s creation. when ready, we offer a leader’s guide with valuable tips.
































education

creation safaris offer unique opportunities for scientists and knowledgeable christian apologetics teachers to convey arguments for creation and against evolution where it is needed most: where the evidence is right in front of you! this section of our website has news, information, scriptures and ready-to-use lesson plans for educators. creation-evolution headlines, a sister site, has daily news reports about scientific evidence. see our videos of actual teaching situations in the great outdoors, and get motivated by the possibilities in god’s creation classroom!
