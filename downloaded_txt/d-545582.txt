snap backup:

a single click to perform a backup
configurable settings
runs on macos, linux, unix, and windows
supports multiple languages


         the first time you run snap backup, you configure where your data files reside and where
         to create backup files. 
         snap backup will also copy your backup to an archive location, such as a usb flash drive
         (memory stick), external hard drive, or
         cloud backup. 
         snap backup automatically puts the current date in the backup file name, alleviating you
         from the tedious task of renaming your backup file every time you backup. 
         the backup file is a single compressed zip file that can be read by standard zip programs
         such as gzip, 7-zip, the unarchiver, and mac's built-in archive utility.

take control

         system administrators have backup procedures for their company servers, databases, and
         network files. 
         individual computer users, on the other hand, are usually left to fend for
         themselves. 
         snap backup is the simple answer for individual users, in the corporation or at home, who
         want to protect their valuable data.
      


for everyone





         snap backup is written in java swing and designed to run on any computer with java. 
         the project is
         open source
         and internationalized (meaning we just need to translate the words to
         support new languages).

         backup into your favorite language.
