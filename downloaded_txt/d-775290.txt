scott outdoors
















 quality guided hunting in the heartland!scott outdoors is owned-operated by sean & denise scott has been provided high quality rifle, black powder and archery hunts in nebraska and missouri for mule deer, whitetail deer, bison, eastern & merriam's turkey since 1995! we have over 40,000 all private acres managed for trophy hunting with the philosophy of quality not quantity. sean has been working as a professional guide since 1979 in the mississippi delta where he started guiding duck hunters as a teenager and has never looked back since then, working as a pro across the usa and around the world. now as time is moving along sean's son eric is fully involved in guiding and day to day operations. eric is a professional with over a decade of guiding experience and longer than that in customer relations!in 2024 nebraska began allowing non-residents to participate in the annual draw due to the anticipated high demand driven by severe tag and permit cutbacks in western states.scottoutdoors was 100% successful in the draw and both of our units had left over permits. we expect to have similar results in the future ensuring you will have a permit.​our hunts are exceptional in all ways, and we are usually booked 1-2 years in advance so we would advise hunters to plan well in advance to ensure they get the time frame and hunt type desired!  we have many, many references from over 40 years of guiding available on request.
