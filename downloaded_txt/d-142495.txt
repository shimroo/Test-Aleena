under-display fingerprint scanners – introduction and best phones
september 19, 2019september 21, 2019
 

 

							every day a new technology pops up, and the entire market gets an upgrade. smartphones are one of the most trending product markets in the world, and even the smallest innovations get a tremendous response from the customers. one of such technologies is the fingerprint sensor which was first introduced as a revolution by apple inc. in their iphone 5s, and since then the technology has taken different shapes, and a surfeit of smartphones are available in the market with all sorts of additional features.

in 2019, the manufacturers took another step towards innovation and introduced under-display fingerprint sensors. it is the next big thing in the market along with notch feature, which is attracting more audience as both the features combined offer a full display which suits the taste of the users. but is the under-display fingerprint sensor really a need or it is just a fancy technology to gather more crowd. let us look at the advantages and disadvantages to understand it better.


advantages
 

having a fingerprint sensor at the backside is pretty common in smartphones. the under-display sensor provides the touch of future as well as adds to providing a better look for the back panel.

the under-display sensor also feels more natural and is much more convenient to use while holding the phone on hand. it does the work of using the phone at ease without taking any unnecessary space on the phone. as it is not visible, it helps in making the phone look neater than the other smartphones.

having a fingerprint sensor at the back also put in the effort to pick it up from the table for unlocking. other than than, the fingerprint sensor under the display can have more area to use as compared to centimetre sensors. it is also protective of the grease and water as the sensor is not exposed and is buried under a glass screen.
disadvantages
the main con of under-display fingerprint sensor is that both optical-type and ultrasonic sensors are slowers than the capacitive ones and also have a higher error rate. they are also dependent on the functionality of the display and gets slower over time as the device gets old.

the cost of repairing can also be a disadvantage as the damage to the screen can also cause the sensors to malfunction and can cost additional money.
the best smartphones with an under-display fingerprint sensor
samsung galaxy s10+
the galaxy s10+ supports an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor which is designed to work well in all lighting conditions. it used 3d technology to scan and thus very hard to fool. it is one of the most accurate optical sensors smartphones that is available in the market today.


huawei p30 pro
huawei has designed its fingerprint sensor to be reachable to the hands from all angles. though it is optical, it works better than its competitive products with speed and precision. it even works with wet fingertips and is the best available in the market.
oneplus 7 pro
oneplus 7 pro has upgraded in-display fingerprint which is fast and consistence for unlocking the device. it supports a bigger sensor made by goodix and has a satisfying vibration motor for noticeable feedback.

 						
 
tips to improve your smartphone photography
september 19, 2019september 21, 2019
 

 

							there have been major advancements in camera photography in the past decade. the phone camera is able to do so much more today, that it is nothing less than a dslr if used correctly. with the necessary photo-editing apps, even professional photographers can create the best photographs using a smartphone. there are several additional photography apps which offer features such as exposure, shutter speed, and editing tools which can provide similar quality photographs as in dslr. here are a few tips that can be helpful in learning to click and edit photographs like professionals, which can be used by anyone using a smartphone.


knowing your phone camera settings
a default app or an external app on a smartphone has manual settings which a user can switch to for clicking the best pictures. one should move beyond the comfort of automatic settings and explore all the features which can enhance the quality of the picture by a lot. playing with the settings will give an estimated idea of which settings will be best for the right lighting, focus, exposure, white balance, and iso. some cameras have exposure and focus working together to create an appropriate photo, but with little tweaks in the setting one can actually get a better result while shooting different situations.
high resolution
higher resolution will always provide better picture quality even after zooming. worrying about the size of the picture will never let any photographer create better images. also, keep in mind that zooming is the last option to consider while clicking a picture. to get the best results, the best way is to click a picture with the subject as close as possible. keeping an external drive to store the pictures can solve the problem of big file sizes. cloud storage is also an alternative for storing images.
using the right side
front cameras are only good for taking selfies. they are not made for clicking high resolutions pictures and usually have low megapixels. the back camera, on the other hand, is equipped with more megapixels and can click higher resolution pictures. also, the front camera is basically difficult to handle while trying to find the right focus while being on the same side of the frame.
using external lenses
although the integrated camera lenses are pretty much good enough to take good pictures, external lenses can add to the quality of pictures. maintaining the camera lens is also necessary and needs to be cleaned from time to time. lenses should always be free of fingerprint stains and dust accumulation. there are micro, macro and fish-eye lenses available for attachment which can help in taking high-quality pictures of small and distance photographs.


using composition rules
all professional photographers implement composition rules, such as rule of third, leading lines, scale, or framing to create marvels. learning these rules can help a lot for the new learners to click good pictures. find the right objects which are visionary and click the different perspectives of the subject to increase the meaning of the photographs, which automatically makes it a good picture.						
 
tablet or laptop – which one is an ideal device
september 19, 2019september 21, 2019
 

 

							the biggest companies, like apple, google, and samsung, have already started launching hybrids of laptops and tablets to provide the best quality high-end devices. the users can now benefit from both for performing almost all the tasks at corporate as well as casual lives. but buying a portable computer is still a difficult choice for people, as there are several features that they require which might not be available in a single device.



as the technology keeps evolving, it is hard to stick to just one device as they keep increasing their levels with every new product. there are several factors which decide whether the device will be able to fulfil your requirement or not. the right device for you will be the one which can support all your multitasking needs. here are the things one should consider before choosing a laptop or a tablet.
portability
it is a fact that tablets, although way bigger than smartphones are smaller in size as compared to laptops. a usual tablet size can range from 7 to 11 inches, whereas a laptop is around 12-16 inches in size. thus, laptops are pretty easy to carry around due to its small size and lightweight. but, microsoft’s surface pro has a screen size of 12.3 inches and weighs 786 grams. having a tablet of that size and weight might not be the best choice if you need a portable device when you can get high-end features in a laptop of smaller size. the different between weighs might not be that noticeable with other things in the bag, but you are really considering better performance in that size, there are plenty of laptops available to fulfil your needs.
performance
laptops are better than tablets when we look at the performance factor, due to their larger hardware packing capability. laptops are also better at multitasking as compared to tablets, although, even tablets are evolving to fulfil all kinds of demands of the users with their own dedicated software and operating systems, such as ios 12 and android pie. manufacturers like acer and microsoft are also providing multitasking features in their tablets. apart from this, there are other features to be compared, such as the storage, ram and processor in which the tablets are not anywhere close on beating laptops. the laptops will continue to have better performance specs than tablets for a long time to come. it does not mean that the tablets are incapable of performing, but the laptops can handle more intense tasks which are not built for tablets.


price
good quality tablets can be pretty expensive. the top-end tablets will range from $800 to $1200, whereas top-end laptops will range from $1000 to $2500. tablets are not as costly as the smartphones as it lacks a few qualities of being a smartphone such as a good camera. they are affordable and can be a good option for casual usage. on the other hand, laptops cost way more, considering that they also offer better performance. getting a low-end laptop might not be the best choice as compared to getting a high-end tablet, although it doesn’t provide good battery and hardware like a laptop, it is still the top-end device of its kind.

 						
 
smartphone innovations of the future
september 19, 2019september 21, 2019
 

 

							the millennials have witnessed the revolutionary period for mobile phones. from the unbreakable nokia range to the groundbreaking iphone, the world has come a long way. today we have all sorts of smartphones with thousands of features and the manufactures are still not satisfied. they are working every day to create the next innovative product, and so we have listed the best innovations that have been introduced in 2019, which will be available to us in a few months.


5g phones
lte or 4g are soon going to be history, just like 3g and 2g. with the introduction of 5g, many companies have already started making smartphones which can support the 5g network. due to the high frequency of the network, many have been against this approach, but as we move towards the future, we hope that proper measures will be taken to reduce the harm. 5g is still in a very early stage of developments, but companies like motorola and huawei are already using it as a marketing strategy to gain early attention of the tech-heads. so even if we cannot use 5g at its full potential today, we can still be prepared with 5g supported devices. 5g will be able to provide up to 100 times faster speed on upload and download, and a better connection even at closed environments.
foldable phones
what is more trending in the market today than foldable smartphones? samsung and motorola have already released their prototypes and samsung went one step ahead by shipping the foldable phones to  get tested by the public. it was a really smart move by samsung to ship the prototypes to users around the world instead of testing it in their labs with machines so that they can get the realtime usage report of their product. after the infamous reviews by the users for the screen dying writing a week or a month, samsung called back all the phones and launched it again after three months with an improved version. although the technology is still developing, we can expect it to be in the market for everyone by the end of 2020.


the notch
the notch was not much of a thing which bothered people until apple launched iphone x in 2017. since then, it has been implemented everywhere and has improved a lot. even samsung has worked a lot with the notch in the past few months of 2019 and came up with pretty interesting designs. the front of the smartphones today is entirely screen except for the space for the camera. even the fingerprint sensor is either on the back or under the display. this technology has provided a much wider space for activities and even enhanced the looks of smartphones by a noticeable level. manufacturers like vivo are a step ahead with a pop-up front camera to provide a complete front display.

although we have so many ideas for smartphones in our head, it is hard to say what is coming up next.						
 
best camera apps for smartphones
september 19, 2019september 21, 2019
 

 

							the camera is one of the most important parts of a smartphone today, which has to be capable of being better than its competition to make the device sell in the market. a smartphone comes with a default camera app which has the basic features. however, professional smartphone photographers cannot make much out of these features and need a better app for clicking better pictures. here is a list of the top camera apps for your smartphone to make it easier for you to choose what you really require.


camera+ 2
it was originally launched for being a replacement app for the ios default camera app, but then it was rebuilt and relaunched in the appstore with added features such as exposure, shutter speed, iso settings, and even automatic settings if you just want to have fun. you can even save the files in raw format and getting the maximum quality out of your clicks. along with this there are plenty of features to choose from which will require your time to explore and learn. the app is available only on ios at a price of $2.99.
cymera
cymera has its own simple and unique interface which makes the users come back for more. it is not designed to be used by professional photographers and has pretty simple functions which can be enjoyed by casual users. it features over 100 selfie filters, varied shooting modes, and even auto retouching tools for enhancing the beauty of the picture. if you need an app with instant filters and instant uploads to social media, this app suits your taste and is available for free on android and ios.
manual
after an app for casual users, we definitely need an app for photography enthusiast who wants to learn more about the exposure, shutter speed and other elements. manual offers a minimalistic interface with all the professional features to get explored by new learners. it is also suitable for professional photographers as all the settings are quick to access and also have the option of saving the files in raw format.


camera fv-5
camera fv-5 is an android app which is aimed at creating professional photographs. it has manual controls similar to using a dslr with adjustable exposure, iso, light meter, white balance, program mode and shutter speed. it has a free version as well as a paid version ($3.95) which gives you access to high-resolution photographs and support the raw format.
halide camera
halide camera is one of the apps which really stands out from the rest of the apps due to powerful, functional, and easy to use features. halide has gesture control which makes it easier for users to take pictures with freehand. swiping on the screen lets you change the exposure and switch between auto and manual focusing. the app is available on ios for $5.99 and has been built while keeping iphone x in mind.
