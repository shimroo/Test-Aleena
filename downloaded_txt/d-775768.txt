                                  until early 2005, the audio critic was a print publication. our migration to the internet has not changed our basic approach to audio reviewing. determining the accuracy of audio reproduction is a completely objective process. evaluating aesthetic satisfaction derived from audio reproduction is, on the other hand, totally subjective. critics who confuse or conflate the two are doing the consumer a great disservice and are responsible for most of the grotesque misinformation that blights today's audio journalism. we believe in measuring and we believe in listening but we don't believe in measuring with our ears.

as usual i'm in the process of trying out a few new gadgets and i will eventually get a full review up of each item but sometimes  the time i need to flash, build, update, test and try to break these items leaves this page without updates for long periods of time.

i have not added much content over the past few months and i guess the biggest reasons are finding the time and secondly the pace at which everything is changing. new android and windows tablets are announced at such high intervals that long term testing and reviews like the ones i like to write aren't feasible simply because by the time i fully test a new device and get around to writing a review it's obsolete and a new model seems to have replaced it! i could write reviews on new devices not tested for more than a few days (like most reviews i read) but those are available everywhere from youtube to various blogs. so i will try and write full reviews of products that may actually be around more than a few months (or development cycle). i plan to keep the ottawa section as updated as i possibly can as it's still relevant to anyone who lives in the area and wants to find places to take the family.
