     we consider it both a pleasure and responsibility to care for children. we are honored you have chosen us as your child’s primary medical provider. evidence-based medicine, a dash of doctor intuition, and a genuine admiration and love for our patients guide our daily activities. we practice comprehensive pediatric medicine which means we follow both prevention and wellness disciplines in addition to treating illnesses.as parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles ourselves, we know what it means to stay up with a sick child, but also appreciate the overwhelming joy and challenges of parenthood. our over 50 years of service to brevard county, including merritt island, melbourne, rockledge, viera, palm bay, and now indialantic, children and their families also represent generations of staff, administration, and clinical providers within our practice. we are proud to share that many of our providers and staff were former patients and returned to work with pediatrics in brevard after earning their degrees.

     what is code g2211?


 by tonya morse
•
july 2, 2024

medical offices get paid by “coding” what they do. these codes are designated by the center for medicaid and medicare services (cms).                                                      a new code – g2211 – has been created by cms for primary care providers to indicate that they are following patients longitudinally and are committed to caring for the “whole patient” over time. this code is needed to account for the complexity and added resource costs of providing truly comprehensive primary care. this code is not related to a clinical condition. instead, it refers to the long-term nature of the practitioner-patient relationship. unlike urgent cares and emergency rooms, pediatrics in brevard (pib) is recognized as a patient center medical home and takes pride in offering this type of care to your child(ren). as such, we will be adding this code to all permitted visits, which excludes annual physicals (well visits). unfortunately, many insurance companies are not paying for all the services we provide, even if cms says we need to document and code for what we do. some carriers will completely deny payment. others will pass the charge on to the patient. we are not happy with their position, and feel it is unfair both to us and to you. but, per our contracts with the insurance companies and complying with cms, we must continue to code for services as instructed. if you receive a bill for this code, g2211, we will not be able to waive the charge. instead, we ask that you follow up with your carrier directly for reimbursement. we take great pride in providing your child with the highest quality of care possible. documenting and coding appropriately for the services we provide is necessary for us to continue to serve our families in this way.



     we are no longer accepting new sunshine patients

effective immediately we are no longer accepting new sunshine patients.  unfortunately, this will include newborns and siblings of our current patients.  this decision was made regretfully after a long history of chronic underpayments by sunshine health and a failure to correct the underpayments after given ample opportunity to do so.  at pediatrics in brevard our priority will always be the welfare of our patients and service to the children of our community, but as a privately owned business we rely on insurance companies to fulfill their contractual obligations with prompt and complete payments so that we can continue to offer quality medical care to all of our patients.  if you or your children are affected by this policy, we apologize and encourage you to contact sunshine health at 1-866-796-0530 with your concerns.

 kd
we always have a great experience with the medical staff at pediatrics in brevard and today was no exception. nurse v took what could have been a stressful procedure and made it painless and stress free. her kindness and cheerful disposition means so much to families when they are getting medical care for their children.  i only recommend people to this group of pediatricians and am always pleased that they have been caring for our children from toddlers to teenagers. thank you!
