our impact 



most people have heard of wlcac because it’s where they, their parents, or grandparents had their first job. as people in the world’s third largest economy experience poverty and homelessness, we work everyday to help people and families thrive.that started in the 60’s when our founder helped lower the federal working age to allow youth in watts to earn a living during the summer after the fateful 1965 watts rebellion. every day for the past 58 years, whether through grassroots community organizing or funded programs, we help provide free support for: family stability, employment, housing and homelessness prevention, seniors, farming, youth development, and cultural enrichment.

our story 



wlcac was founded during the civil rights movement by ted watkins, who journeyed alone at 12 to watts, california from meridian, mississippi during the great migration, to escape a lynch mob. orphaned in segregated 1920’s los angeles, mr. watkins eventually established wlcac.
during the 1992 los angeles rebellion, our headquarters burned to the ground and we rebuilt: ted’s daughter teryl led the creation of our seven acre healing arts oasis that tells the story of racial injustice in the united states and empowers individuals with tools to create change.
today, ted’s son timothy guides wlcac’s future in building generational wealth through home ownership and entrepreneurship and community wellness with mudtown farms urban agriculture center. wlcac is the definitive family support system for angeleno’s experiencing poverty, with an unchanging mission to improve the quality of life for residents of watts and surrounding areas. by working with experts in social services, community development, technology and entertainment, tim is building platforms for people in watts to tell our stories and share our culture in a way that drives local economic growth and transforms lives.
