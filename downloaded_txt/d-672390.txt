shoulder pain causesthe shoulder can also become painful if there is a swelling of the bursa sacs or swelling of the tendons around the shoulder. bone spurs and torn cartilage are also causes of shoulder pain in many cases. the rotator cuff is a big cause of pain in the shoulder as well. lastly, the shoulder can become painful and stiff if it remains unused for too long – this is known as “frozen shoulder.”shoulder treatmentthe shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body, making it extremely unstable and more inclined to dislocate or become more painful than other joints. mr al-sabti can provide the best treatment for your individual case, helping you back to full fitness again with our specialist recovery care.
