why maya ring slings?
the comfortfit and lightly padded slings both have our signature zippered pocket for all things you need within arms reach: paci? check. phone? check. wallet, keys, spare diaper and wipes? check, check, check!
 
we believe ring slings are the best âup-downâ carrier for all those times when your tot needs to be held . . . and put down . . . and held again. slip it on, slip them in and donât miss a beat. rated for 7-35 lbs, you can begin your snuggles from day 1! did you know each of our slings has been individually tested to 250 pounds and are compliant with cpsia and astm standards? so you can keep carrying them well into the scraped knees and âhold me please!â phases.
 
we know youâll love our no-fuss, cotton for a super soft all weather feel that can be tossed in the wash over and over, and over again. your sling is 100% hand-loomed in the highlands of guatemala by indigenous mayan weavers. these artisans create color-fast, easy-care fabrics and designs with the most beautiful hues, characteristic of this vibrant ancient culture. our strict devotion to the central american free trade agreement (cafta) has fostered thriving indigenous support and lifelong friendships with our team in guatemala. hand-spun, dyed, hand-loomed and sewn in the same region, with the same hands for over 25 years, every fiber of your maya is made with love.â 
so carry on, and hold your little love, with maya love





why comfortfit fits you:
the comfortfit gathered shoulder has a unique-to-maya spandex inner panel that cushions your shoulder and moves with you for superior comfort and practical care-giving. who doesnât need greater flexibility? in the comfortfit, reaching out is no problem; the fabric stays on your shoulder instead of popping off! so grab that latte, toss your hair, and keep your kiddo close. worried about it bunching into your neck? the removable cloth band adjusts the shoulder width from wide to narrow, so you can create a shoulder style thatâs exactly what your body needs (without bunching!).

lightly padded
beginner friendly, lightweight, smooth & simple







why the lightly padded ring sling is your ring sling-
with an 8-inch wide lightly padded shoulder, this ring sling is the most beginner-friendly! the sleek padding cups the shoulder to sit flat with no bunching or digging at the neck and an always supportive hold for even the most luscious toddlers. no painful pressure points, no shifting shoulder fabric, no bulk; this sling folds up a bit smaller than the comfortfit and is a little easier to slip on quickly for on the go wearing, or helping the unfamiliar grandparent to get it situation.

your perfect sling fit
ring sling sizing depends on two things: 1) your body size, and 2) your tail length preference. the same size maya ring sling will support your baby from the time he is an 8-pound newborn until he is a 35-pound toddler or preschooler.
how to measure: using a measuring tape, measure just beneath your bust, or at your armpits, above your bust.
the models images are noted with their height and weight to help you decide your sizing. below, the model shown is 5’6″, 170 lbs., and wears a size 14 in us women’s clothing. if you are using extra fabric for sun-shade, nursing coverage, or the newborn pillow tuck, the tail should reach at least to mid-thigh.
maya ring slings support your baby by wrapping around the two of you like a hug. therefore, the length you need is based purely on the amount of fabric you need to encircle you both around one shoulder.
your sling has a “tail” in addition to the part hugging you and your baby — this is the fabric that hangs down from the rings. its commonly preferred for the tail to fall about mid-thigh, however, if your between sizes, you may like to size down if you prefer a shorter tail, or size up if you prefer a longer tail. don’t forget our signature zippered pocket in the bottom 11″ of the tail, when factoring in your length preference.
