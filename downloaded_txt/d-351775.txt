			april '18 - check out the plans page. for $45, dive in and have fun building your own heli-chair!
the heli-chair helicopter flight training device is a proven helicopter flight emulator, not a simulator. emulation of the flight dynamics of a helicopter is very difficult for a computer flight simulation to accomplish, therefore the heli-chair utilizes a real helicopter to give you hands-on training. you will be flying from a mock-up cockpit that has all the same controls as a full 
		  
          
  size helicopter; a cyclic, collective and throttle, and anti-torque pedals which fixed-wing pilots often refer to as rudder pedals. the helicopter is remotely controlled from the helicopter cockpit mock-up. all of the physics, fluid dynamics, and other aerodynamics of rotary wing flight apply. nothing is left out because it is real, not simulated. wind gusts, ground effect, settling with power...every last detail. the heli-chair is  a very high fidelity flight training system.






		  common misconceptions:
		  myth 1) the heli-chair is a toy, you can't learn to fly a helicopter with it
		  myth 2) you don't have that seat of the pants feedback, it won't work
		  myth 3) model helicopters have gyros, big helicopters don't
		  myth 4) if it's facing you, the controls are reversed
		  myth 5) you can't run away when it comes at you

		  and the very simple explanations:
		  1)the heli-chair is deceptively simple, but it can definitely teach you how to fly a helicopter.
		  2) you don't need the feedback, you need to learn muscle memory first!
		  3) there is nothing over-stable about the model, it can be tuned to fly exactly like a real one.
		  4) any good pilot learns that the key is in footwork, learn to maintain heading and go from there.
	    5) you should be maintaining a safe distance regardless.  there is no added risk with being seated.

    the heli-chair is perfect for flight schools and individuals.  if you want to learn to fly a helicopter, there is simply no better method available!  helicopter flight instructors and schools can take advantage of the heli-chair to keep students interested and to lower the overall cost of attaining a rotorcraft pilot rating.



demonstration video download (8mb, 3min long), see a student pilot hovering a robinson r22 beta ii after just 30 seconds of flight time in the real helicopter! see footage of how well the heli-chair really works in this plain and simple demonstration! read more on our "training works" page.  watch our split screen video showing the heli-chair in action! (14mb, 4min long).  if flying a model isn't up your alley, or if you are looking for something to do once you successfully graduate the heli-chair training program, try our latest product, the mosquito training pacakge. with this setup, you can retrofit your mosquito ultralight helicopter with electronics sufficient to teach yourself how to fly.  don't risk flying your helicopter without first getting the basics! 
learning to hover the remote control helicopter entails all the same motor skills and mastery of flight that you will be required to have if you are to fly a full size helicopter with an faa pilot certificate. flight training with the heli-chair is very effective and has been proven to teach students how to fly the real thing! you can impress your flight instructor at the local flight school by going for your first flight and hovering, when most people take hours and hours to master that skill. spend your expensive flight time and hourly costs of training on something besides learning how to move your hands and feet. learn the basics of hovering, forward flight, pedal turns and more using this unique flight training device.
purchasing and operating the heli-chair is relatively simple and inexpensive in comparison with full size helicopters. please explore our website and contact us if you have further questions about how the heli-chair can teach you how to fly, or just plain how to have fun!
