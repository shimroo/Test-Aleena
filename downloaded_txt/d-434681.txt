1930






states marine corp. established by henry mercer.
	








1931






cornelius s. walsh brought in by henry mercer as secretary. 
	walsh later became investor in the company.
	not having enough money to purchase ships, 
	they chartered foreign flagged vessels, running them as tramps, sailing whereever cargo was 
	available. gradually the company developed scheduled liner services, though always adjusting 
	their vessel's schedules to follow cargo demand.

1946






after the war states marine bought surplus vessels at low prices and 
	continued to charter both u.s. and foreign tonnage, retaining policy of moving ships among 
	different routes to accomodate demand and maximize profits. using charters, the size of it's 
	fleet could be adjusted to meet market demands, joining conferences where beneficial, and 
	competing as an outsider in other routes. states marine pioneered the simultaneous operation 
	of u.s. and foreign flagged ships.

states marine took over management of bloomfield steamship co., 906 cotton 
	exchange bldgs., houston, tx, eventually gaining control of this company, retaining the 
	name until all vessels disposed/scrapped by mid 1969. bloomfield was originally founded 
	after ww ii by ben m. bloomfield, a former executive with lykes brothers steamship co., 
	based in houston, tx, acquiring surplus vessels to serve the gulf region. lykes blocked 
	bloomfield's subsidy application, resulting in bloomfield selling its 3 surplus c2's and 
	80% of the stock to farrell lines, the owner of the remaining 20% of the stock. in 1951 
	bloomfield, with local texas backing, reestablished his company with 5 vc2s and 3 ec2s, 
	servicing europe and the mediterranean from the gulf. while lykes couldn't block bloomfield 
	during the korean war, with the u.s. government's demand for shipping, following this war 
	pressure was brought to bear, causing the passage of management to states marine.
	states marine filed first application for vessel subsidies from the u.s. government.

1956






march 6: isthmian lines, inc. purchased for an estimated $30 million 
	from u.s. steel by states marine corporation. in retrospect, u.s. steel had made a good 
	business decision in disposing of its obsolete fleet, thereby avoiding altogether the 
	problem of replacing its break-bulk vessels. this acquisition hit shipping circles 
	"like a bombshell" because it was the largest single shipping purchase in memory. 
	physical transfer of the fleet was expected to be completed by the end of the month. 
	ralph blough, chariman of the board of u.s. steel, explained that u.s. steel's need for 
	these ships was over. the addition of isthmian's 24 vessels makes states marine the largest 
	unsubsidized u.s. flag firm and came close to challenging u.s. lines in size. henry mercer, 
	president of states marine, seeing increasing demand for u.s. flagged tonnage, was acquiring 
	a fast fleet to supplant their heavy use of "time chartered" ships. plus, they 
	acquired isthmian's world wide web of agents and contacts with resources and a reputation 
	for service unexcelled in the international shipping business.
	at this point, states 
	marine's future plans were dependant upon their pending application with the u.s. maritime 
	commission for an operational differential subsidy for four cargo services, including 
	plans to build 30 new cargo liners at a cost of $232,000,000 over the next 15 years, 
	ready to begin the first 6 for $42,000,000 contingent upon the award of the subsidy.
	at the time of the purchase, isthmian was exclusively siu and states marine exclusively nmu.
	golden state (2), vc2, 1944, 7,598 tons, acquired from bloomfield steamship co. 
	of houston, tx.
	the following vessels were sold to bloomfield steamship co. of houston, tx:
