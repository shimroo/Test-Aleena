lent & easter at first & franklin


 









 
 























at first & franklin, we strive to be an inclusive, diverse congregation devoted to enriching our community through socially engaging and relevant preaching and an inspirational congregational music program, service to others, and fellowship that increases our understanding of one another. our mission is to make baltimore a better community for everyone, and we welcome anyone who comes through our doors.






you belong here!
first & franklin presbyterian church (pcusa) welcomes everyone to worship with us, regardless of color, background, gender expression, gender identity, or sexual orientation. a member of the more light presbyterians since 1980, our congregation is committed to inclusivity and full participation in the church for all individuals, including service and the clergy. 
we believe that the affirmation of one's unique self is scripturally based and a natural outflow of god's perfect creation and love.
at first & franklin, you are welcome, you are seen, and you are loved just the way god made you.
