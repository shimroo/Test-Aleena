champion groups 



champion groups is the place where we learn about each other and grow together as a body of believers. no matter where you are in life, you matter here and there’s a  group for you to discover the champion in you. 















community outreach



it’s the way we demonstrate the love of christ and how we express our willingness to live by serving others. 















baby dedications and baptisms bring us so much joy. it’s our chance to share in the public witness of a spiritual commitment to christ of a little one or an adult choosing to rededicate their lives. new birth or new born, it’s all gods good pleasure to witness and ours as well.

about us 




godgod is  the creator and ruler of the universe. he has eternally existed in three  personalities; the father, the son, and the holy spirit. these three  are co-equal and are one god.(genesis 1:1, 26-­‐27; ephesians 4:14-­‐16, matthew 28:19; phil. 2:5-­‐11)




the biblethe  bible is god’s word to us and was written by human authors, under the  supernatural guidance of the holy spirit. it is the source of truth for  christian beliefs and living. because, it is inspired by god, it is the  truth without any mixture of error.(2 timothy 3:16; 2 peter 1:20-21; john 17:17;)




jesusjesus  christ is the son of god. he is co-equal with the father. he lived a  sinless human life and offered himself as the perfect sacrifice for the  sins of all people by dying on a cross. he arose from the dead after  three days to demonstrate his power over sin and death. he ascended to  heaven and will return to earth to reign.(matthew 1:22-­‐23, matthew 3:16-­‐17; john 1:1-­‐5, 14; hebrews 4:14-­‐15, 1 corinthians 15:3-­‐4, romans 1:3-­‐4)




the holy spiritthe holy  spirit is co-equal with the father and the son of god. he is present in  the world to make men aware of their need for jesus christ. he also  lives in every christian from the moment of salvation. he provides the  christian with power for living, understanding and doing what is right.(john 16:7-13; 1 cor. 2:12; 1 cor. 3:16; ephesians 1:13)
