    welcome to prime engineering
 




since 1984, our primary motivation has been proper, safe standing for people with physical and/or aging related disabilities. through the years, prime engineering has steadily grown as the innovative designer of standing systems by listening to clients, parents and healthcare professionals, while staying altruistic to our goal, “standing you the way nature intended."
standing is important, but standing correctly is crucial. to realize the full benefit of a standing program you must stand correctly. others have tried, but no one matches our quality and commitment to proper standing and positioning. standing is an art – try one of our products and feel the difference that standing correctly can make in your life!



 
 





 
 
 
 
 

dynamic mobility systems

kidwalk enables children to be participants in their world, not as observers, thru hands free, self-initiated exploration. independent, self-initiated movement is the key to developing cognitive, language and motor skills, learning spatial relationships, and exploring the world.
