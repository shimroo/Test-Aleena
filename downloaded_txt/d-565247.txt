welcome to lakersweb.net
this site is full of los angeles lakers and minneapolis lakers stuff. 
in the 2004-2005 season the lakers couldn't enter the playoffs  for the first time in 11 years and only the fifth time in history. but they rebounded in the 2005-2006 season with the return of coach phil jackson. after a 45-37 regular season, l.a. had to face phoenix in the first round of the playoffs, and against all odds took a 3-1 lead that included a couple of miracle shots from kobe bryant in  game 4.  
but the suns became the eighth team in nba history to overcome such a deficit, 
winning the final three games including a  blowout in game 7. 
in 2006-07 the lakers had another early exit of the playoffs again at the hands of phoenix. the 2007-08 season had a very  tumultuous start with kobe bryant asking to be traded, but turned out to be the year the l.a. returned to elite status. andrew bynum development brought hopes of a bright future, but it was his season-ending injury that triggered a trade that added pau gasol to the roster. his basketball skills made the team a instant title contender that won the strong western conference and had a great playoff performance until the finals. where everything changed and the lakers were completely dominated by their classic archrival, the celtics. 
the lakers took it personally and started the 2008-09 season with only one goal in mind: the championship. and they conqueret it showing moments of great basketball and a defense that was fantastic when they were in the mood for it. they dominated the orlando magic in the 2009 nba finals and got their 15th title for the franchise, the fourth for kobe bryant and derek fisher and the record-breaking 10th for coach phil jackson. and all that without big contributions from andrew bynum and sasha vujacic. 
 so this is a good time to take a look at the lakers' rich past. we are adding year by year information including  season summaries, all the scores, streaks, rosters, and playoff performances. we are doing it slowly but it is almost ready, so please be patient and we will soon complete the little data that is missing. all the game logs from 1947 to the present are already available.. 
in the other sections of the site you will find updated information about the lakers, like the 2008-2009 roster, but we have mainly  focused on 
        the history: the championships, biographies of the great players that have worn the laker jersey, the greatest moments, and much more. if you are looking information about current games and news we recommend our friends of los angeles lakers universe. 
we also feature a big picture gallery and a link collection with related sites. enjoy it!
