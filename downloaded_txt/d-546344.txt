the decrease in the recession rate of the 
						horseshoe falls is related to the reduction of the river 
						discharge over the falls because of water diversion 
						upriver for hydro generation and the increase in the 
						waterfall lip length, whereas that of the american falls 
						is solely due to the reduction in water ﬂow volume.
