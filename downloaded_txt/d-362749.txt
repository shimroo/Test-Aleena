						"in the year-long battle of dealing with two civil suits, the staff of borton petrini has been a lifeline to my sanity. their informative, as well as supportive responses to my often panicky queries made it possible for me to carry on with the rest of my duties with almost intact capacities. i cannot express how important this was to me. i highly recommend this law firm for help in dealing with the convoluted and arcane world of civil law."
