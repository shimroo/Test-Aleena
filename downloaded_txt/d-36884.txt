medieval lutes 

no original medieval lutes have survived. however many fine paintings, frescoes and woodcuts exist which show the detailed appearance, and educated guesses can be made about the internal structure. i will discuss the detailed evidence in the light of your requirements before deciding on a final design. the much copied arnault of zwolle drawings, of 1450, seem to be based on a misunderstanding and they result in a very ugly lute which is quite unlike the majority of lutes shown in pictures of the period. i would not normally base designs on this.


1. 58cm, 4 course medieval lute based on iconographical sources circa 1350 - 1400. 9 ribs of figured sycamore which flow in a smooth curve between body and neck. two circular roses of gothic design; one large, the other
                        small. boxwood fingerboard and pegs. designed to be played with a plectrum.

                                elaborate circular sunken rose of pine and parchment as well as a lancet-window shaped rose just below the fingerboard. this was the transitional period between plectrum and finger style techniques and this lute is suitable

nb. lutes 7, 8 & 9 can be built as 10 course instruments with a string length of 63.5cm to enable the basses to sound out well, in line with dowland's remark that around 1600 the necks of lutes were lengthened to give 10 frets on the neck. this is my recommended solution to the 10 course lute in g, which probably never existed but now seems to be much in demand! 10 course lutes were most likely to have been in f.
