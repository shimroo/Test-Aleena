 i am taking commissions.

how it works: you let me know what you are interested in. some commissions 
i have done in the past: favorite animals, totem animals, pet portraits, 
nursery art, knitted shawls for weddings and other special events, 
illustrated favorite quotes, etc.

	then i will quote you a price. pricing is generally based on size and 
complexity  and pricing will be similar to what you see in my etsy shop. 

once we agree on a price i may ask for a percentage down. i don't always 
do this, it depends on if i need to purchase materials. i will also give 
you a timeline on when to expect to see the art.

once the art is created i will send you a photo and if you like it then 
you will pay and i will ship the art! 



i take commissions for paintings, 
knitted shawls, and beadwork. email me for more information.
