season your conversation





"be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone." colossians 4:5-6 how do you act toward your friends and family?  the book of james is a great place to start especially james 1:19-20, james 3 and james 4:1-12. do you grab the opportunity to share jesus anytime?  read 2 timothy 4:1-4 (especially verse 2 "be prepared in season and out of season" which means anytime!) is your conversation full of grace?  read ephesians 4:29, "do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen." read also, proverbs 10:31 and psalm 37:30. is your everyday conversation "seasoned with salt"?  salt provides flavor. if you have a judgmental attitude toward others (condemnation, ridicule, thinking you're better than others), then there's no flavor (salt) in you and your conversation with others. when you're kind, loving, forgiving, accepting and compassionate for the lord and for others, then your life exerts flavor on those you converse with.  a good scripture to read and memorize is galatians 5:22-23. this is the fruit of the spirit! another question is, is the fruit of the spirit living in you? do you have the fruit of the spirit? finally, above all, you will be able to "know how to answer everyone." meditate and pray about this!
