martians killan insidious conspiracy threatens the survival of america and mars




on mars, survival depends on access to water. american corporations control their water, and members of the martian government allied with powerful washington politicians are about to assassinate devon pratt, the president. when the vice president is assassinated instead of pratt, more murders plunge the white house into desperation and fear. a cowardly pratt calls on his gifted but flawed friend, leon gallagher, to save his life and find the killer of the vice president.

leon soon sees that pratt's potential assassination is only one part of this conspiracy; he discovers the atheistic martians are allied with religious american gnostics who believe that america is the kingdom of god, and its future will be determined by the will of god and not the american government. the gnostics, he finds, intend to run god's kingdom from mars. in a race against time, leon, wonders whether he or anyone can stop this insidious conspiracy, but knows if he fails the martian colonies will perish, and the united states as a country will disappear.
