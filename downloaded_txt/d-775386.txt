process. their attention to detail and combined knowledge enabled us to achieve a successful and winning outcome. both paul and colin are true professionals with a high level of customer service. the entire practice provides seamless and transparent communication. while also building a strong partnership at the same time. i would  highly recommend the practice of kalfus and nachman.

- jeff b























"down to earth. no bs."
what a weird time for all of this to happen. i'm grateful for the down to earth, no bs, approach to my case. though we had to draw it out due to the pandemic and the idiocy of the military medical system,  the k&n staff stuck with me and always treated me with kindness and respect.  the ladies at the front are the sweet angels that make you miss your grandma. they deserve all the love!!

- ashleyann

taking on your legal burden after an accident or injurytrust our personal injury lawyers in norfolk, roanoke, & newport newsthe physical, emotional, and financial issues that occur after an accident or injury are overwhelming. this is why it is vital that you have a dedicated attorney on your side to advocate for your right to compensation and hold any negligent party responsible. our virginia personal injury lawyers at kalfus & nachman pc work hard to ensure that you are able to take care of yourself and your family while you focus on recovering from your injuries.















highly experienced in handling complex casesevery case is unique. the more complex, the more the firm’s resources, power, and experience count in obtaining maximum compensation. the insurance companies may spend significant money to try to wear down the client and minimize the eventual settlement. the insurance research council conducted a study to compare the value of settlements people received for bodily injuries in auto accidents due to driver and/or manufacturer negligence. people who were represented by an attorney win 3.5 times more than injury victims who don’t hire a personal injury lawyer. our virginia personal injury lawyers, on the other hand, have the financial resources to litigate these complex cases for as long as necessary to ensure maximum compensation. just look at the significant results achieved by our virginia personal injury lawyers to illustrate what a really powerful law firm can do for you.
