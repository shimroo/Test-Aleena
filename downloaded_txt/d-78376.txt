the internet pinball machine database — also known as the ipdb — is a comprehensive, searchable encyclopedia of virtually every pinball machine ever commercially made.  the database currently includes 80,416 images of  6,696 games, 5,940 other game related files, and links to other pinball websites, grouped by machine.  the database also includes pitch & bat baseball games, cocktail table machines, bingos, and payout machines ... when they have a pinball theme.
the data in this database has been laboriously gathered by the editors over many years, from books, photographs, flyers, web sites, pinball manufacturers, collectors' personal records, and of course the pinball machines themselves.  most of the actual photographs in the database came from various collectors – over 2,832 different contributors to date.
we do not buy or sell games, and do not know game values or track selling prices.
to search the database, enter a word or two in the box above and press the search database button.  try a portion of a game's name, a manufacturer, designer, feature, or even a theme.  if you want to search more than one field at a time, click on advanced search.  you can also do a quick search using the format 'manufacturer/game_name', where the manufacturer (before the slash) is part of the manufacturer name, and game_name (after the slash) is a part of the machine name.  for example: 'bal/addams' will find bally's 'the addams family'.   you can also use 'gid/##' and 'img/##' if you know the game number or image id from this database.
if you would like to add something to the database, click the "submit changes" link displayed with each machine and then follow the instructions.  we encourage everyone to share their photos, files and other pin-related information with others in the hobby; all submitted images should show these machines in their original factory condition, unmodified and unrepainted.  the database is an unparalleled resource for all pinball enthusiasts, with the largest collection of pinball machines available online, but its success depends on its users.  for more information on the ipdb, click the links at the bottom of the page.
