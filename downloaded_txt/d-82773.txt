 action life at your event
if your church or community or organization is looking for some information on any number of life issues, action life is prepared and ready to give a presentation to your group.  we have professional speakers on staff and there is no charge to you, although a free-will offering is most appreciated.

 

 church reps needed
action life is looking for church representatives in the ottawa area to inform local churches of our events and initiatives throughout the year.  although there is not a lot of work involved, action life benefits greatly by these modest efforts.  please consider joining our team today!
