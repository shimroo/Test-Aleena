you have entered marvelmasterworks.com:the marvel masterworks 
        resource page!

        as author of this page, my hopes are that it will be a one-stop resource 
        for information about the content of the masterworks that have been published, 
        as well as the most current news about this series and its future 
        volumes. but though this site's namesake is the series of deluxe hardcovers we all love, it's not the only
topic we have covered around here! if you're a fan of essentials, the oversize marvel hardcovers, the new marvel
premiere edition or omnibus lines, or the wide assortment of trade paperbacks that marvel publishes on a monthly
basis, i think you'll find this website and the community it fosters to be an authoritative resource for all your
marvel collected editions needs. to me, the masterworks are the top of the pyramid of marvel's collected editions output, but there is lots for masterworks fans to enjoy in the other books marvel produces.
