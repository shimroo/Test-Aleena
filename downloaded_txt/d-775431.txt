our history

for nearly two decades, artists euler and esau torres toured with their band los malandrines, entertaining audiences across the us. their experience and insight in the music industry inspired them to create a platform to support other latin musicians and bring this compelling music to a wider audience.

in february 2021, euler and esau teamed up with industry leaders pedro zamora and alfonso de alba and entrepreneur stephen torres to form lenusa inc., an ipo-worthy company to serve the latin entertainment sector in the us, mexico, and latin america.

since then, over 60 industry players have invested in lenusa. our ticketing technology is up and running. and our cashless payment system has performed well in beta testing.

we are supported by:








serving the latin entertainment sector with:

lenusa is pursuing the $2.6-trillion spending power of us latinos in addition to building a proprietary user database that will help external organizations connect with the network. lenusaâs beachhead product is our ticketing platform, www.lenusa.com.
