"the testimony of jesus is the spirit 
    of prophecy." revelation 19:10
 
 



    in 2003, the hebron christian church of winder,     georgia hosted dr. david reagan of the lion and lamb ministries for a     prophecy conference. during the conference i  questioned dr. reagan     about the pre-trib rapture theory.  this is a transcript of our     exchange.   
 
rapture at the last trumpet 
in 2001 i     questioned and debated dr. thomas ice on the timing of the 
    rapture. dr. ice     is the executive director of the pre-trib research center in washington, dc,     an organization founded by tim lahaye. dr. ice     was hosted by calvary chapel of athens, georgia to conduct a prophecy     conference. below is the transcript of the exchange between dr. ice     (pre-tribulation) and richard perry (post-tribulation).   
the great rapture debate  
the doctrine of imminency states that jesus can return     at any moment, nothing else must happen before the rapture.
    imminency,     the heart of pretribulationism 
the pre tribulation rapture vs.     post tribulation rapture debate is a question of when christ will gather the     church.

    about the rapture




the 
    pre-tribulation rapture is not in the scriptures


by 
    sarah kittell

some ask, "how can i understand what the bible says regarding the return of     christ?  smarter people than i have studied the bible, yet they do not     all agree."  but, yahweh says, "for we do not write you     anything you cannot read or understand," and he 
  also explains how to  

  correctly handle the word of truth 
days before     christ went to the cross, his disciples asked, "what will be the     sign of your coming and the end of the age."     

 in     the lord s own word 
 jesus directs us to understand what is     

       spoken of 
  through the prophet   daniel. 
many have been deceived by a 
  popular new teaching (last 200 years) which says that christ will come 
  secretly and rapture his church before the     tribulation. to test this new teaching read   

  you have heard it said      and          early church writings. 
the organized     church is like a train that has come off its tracks. two tracks of the     church are the great commission and the elementary teachings about     christ.  to understand the derailment read the   


the second coming is foundational to 
  the  faith 
                  


     sound teaching is critical to the gospel

 christ     instructed his followers to know about his second coming.  

 
  yahweh commands     that we 
  understand prophecy 
   know and     understand about the second coming

      the     time is near

       second     coming  is     foundational to the christian faith

      the day of the lord.

   this is the day that the lord has made!

 
 bible mysteries revealed
 

 

it is the glory     of god to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings     (proverbs 25:2).  daniel replied, "no wise man, enchanter, magician     or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, but there     is a god in heaven who reveals mysteries (daniel 2:27-28).

warnings from yahweh

jesus instructs his followers to be alert     to the deception that will be perpetrated on us in the time of the end,     especially from those claiming to be speak for god.  
 "son of man, prophesy against the shepherds         of israel; prophesy and say to them: 'this is what the sovereign yahweh         says: woe to the shepherds of israel who only take care of themselves!         should not shepherds take care of the flock?  ... i am against the shepherds and will hold them         accountable for my flock        (ezekiel 34:1-10).
 
shepherds

 word  to the     shepherds 
son of man, prophesy against the     prophets of israel who are now prophesying. say to those who prophesy out of     their own imagination: their visions are false and their divinations a lie.     they say, 'yahweh declares,' though i have not spoken? ezekiel     13:1-7. 

 
false     prophets

  i never said i would return before the great     tribulation.

  ourselves  

   deception to great deception then 
  the end  

 how we treat prophecy

 if they persecuted me, they     will persecute you also. 
"son of man, i have made you a         watchman for the house of israel; so hear the word i speak and give them         warning from me. when i say to the wicked, 'o wicked man, you will         surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways,         that wicked man will die for his sin, and i will hold you accountable         for his blood. but if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways         and he does not do so, he will die for his sin, but you will have saved         yourself" (ezekiel 33:7-9). 

 
 i am innocent of the blood of         all men.        for i have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of god         (acts 20:26-27).  richard h. perry
