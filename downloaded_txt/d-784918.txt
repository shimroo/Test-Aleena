you are not alone.













our lives are spent in a journey to find god—a journey with lots of peaks and valleys. we experience god at home, at work, at school, while shopping, in church, in community service, and in prison. 
everyone is welcome and invited to join us in ministries of service, worship, education and prayer to experience the fullness of joy through faith in jesus christ.

connecting to god. the sacraments of holy baptism and holy communion are at the center of worship. and we love music!













choir music. organ music. band music. singing. we love music and are blessed with so many talented musicians from our community!click here to see more about how music brings added joy to worship.   connecting to each other.
