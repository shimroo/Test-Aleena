368th history & timeline



   ballad of the 368th fighter groupgerald m. hansonthese brave young men came from near’ every state,to save the free world from terror and hate.leaving their loved ones at home to worry and wait,they joined the fighter group numbered three sixty-eight.they headed for war with courage and their skills,to battle the axis powers that outlawed freedom and free will.back in the states they prayed to the almighty up in heaven,he answered their prayers with the p-47.the pilots, they were dauntless whenever they flew,entrusting their safe return to both god and ground crew.they wreaked havoc and hell from the wild blue yonder,flying tight in formation in their trusted fighter/bombers.when planes didn’t return it was part of the high cost,the price of our freedom paid, by those injured and lost.we thank our greatest generation, who fought ‘till the war was won,like the 368th fighter group, it was always “second to none”.

on day 9 of the battle of the bulge, 2nd lt. donald n evans was shot down behind enemy lines. defying odds, he survived bailing out of his p-47 fighter plane seconds before it crashed. he limped and crawled through the snow-covered ardennes forest until after dark,  trying to find a way back to the american front lines. lost, cold, and hungry, don spent christmas eve huddled under a pine tree, wondering if he'd ever see his family again. ahead lay capture by nazi ss troops, a 200-mile forced march, near starvation, abuse by guards, and internment in a german pow camp. his will to overcome nearly insurmountable odds is inspiring. that he actually did so is a miracle.
