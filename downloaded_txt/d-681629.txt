trakehner horses...
•beautiful, athletic, intelligent, responsive, substantial yet refined... 
•naturally talented and successful sport horses in dressage, jumping, three-day eventing, and the hunters... 
•loved and prized as professional, amateur, children's, and family horses. 
that's why we chose to breed trakehner horses, the most elegant of the warmblood horse breeds, at our family farm in northern michigan.

we'd love to tell you more about trakehners and our philosophies on
•raising foals and

great horses start as great foals, and good raising practices help our foals to reach their potential. our foals are handled daily starting at birth and are raised to develop their good temperaments, people-loving personalities, and willing dispositions. 
we breed horses for sale, so we strive to bring up our young trakehners to be just the horses that their future owners would have raised for themselves—kind and excellent partners—whether they are sold as weanlings or at riding age.
breeding trakehner sport horses

raising horses well takes dedication and a lot of time. as trakehner horse breeders, we are committed to improving the breed and producing horses perfectly suited to their purposes as riding horses. so we decided to focus on quality instead of quantity when we began breeding trakehners in 1997. we have only a few foals each year, and all of our young trakehner horses for sale are from our breeding program.
to breed quality sport horses you need quality mares. experts believe that the mare contributes up to 70% of her foals' attributes, so broodmares have to be the best available. our trakehner broodmares include our original three select ata official stud book mares and top quality mares from our own breeding program. 
we breed our trakehner mares to stallions who complement their strengths, choosing the best stallions by their proven performance ability, conformation, movement, bloodlines, and dispositions. we have always used purebred trakehner stallions, both imported and bred in north america, but now have two mares in foal to a thoroughbred stallion. our 2006 foal crop will include our first anglo-trakehners.
