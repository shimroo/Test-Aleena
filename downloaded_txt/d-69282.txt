what is earth/matrix ? 



in the earth/matrix series of essays, i explore the mathematics and geometry behind the ancient artwork. in october of 1992, i discovered images that were encoded into the ancient artwork. this discovery led me to research the mathematical basis of those geometrical designs.
        historically significant numbers apparently chosen out of randomness, in fact, reflect methods of computation that suggest the idea of a single system for reckoning time.
        
        we are here today because of the ancient past; we cannot continue to ignore this fact. it is time to recognize this by granting value to the ancient past and its legacy of knowledge. for that, the popular idea that the ancients knew little or nothing about anything must be discarded. it must be first recognized that we can learn from them. 





we must open our minds a little more. we must expect the artwork to speak to us, and lay aside for a while the intention of telling others what the artwork means. let the ancients tell us what it means. for that we need to study the math and geometry behind their designs.
      now, it is time to illustrate some of the images that are based upon those mathematical and geometrical considerations. i have already presented some images within the ancient artwork, such as the aztec hummingbird, pakal's cosmic principle of creation, and distinct analytical views of the aztec calendar. there are many, many more images encoded into the ancient artwork. i now wish to begin making these images public.
    let us look at the ancient past with an open heart, a learning mind. we are all students in the face of the past. and, anything we learn from them, we can only pass on to future generations, as they have done with us. more...

different planets as unit 1.0:

different planets as unit 1.0: mass, radii, density and other categories.
                  
                  in this presentation of slides, we examine the relationships of the planets as of specific characteristics with different planets being assigned unit 1.0 for diferent data.
                  comparisons based on different planets being set at unit 1.0 allow us to identify different relational aspects among the planets, and progressions in the numerical values otherwise overlooked.
                  the traditional analysis of maintaining earth the 3rd planets in the solar system as unit 1.0 denies patterns from appearing when other planets are assigned unit 1.0 for comparison. without this perspective, it is difficult to teach young astronomers the rich analytical possibility of this system. the scienctific literature conventionally presents the earth as unit 1.0 to its own detriment. ..more

the goldbach conjecture and the universe of primes numbers




book:the goldbach conjecture and the universe of primes numbers
              
the goldbach conjecture and the universe of primes nubers examines the even-sum 
        tables of the natural numbers and prime numbers in proving the conjecture. 
        the explanation of the inner workings of the goldbach conjecture are rendered 
        into simple math. knowing how to add is all that is required. profusely 
        illustrated with easy-to-read math tables explaining how the sum of primes 
        perform in relation to the conjecture.

the author examines the goldbach conjecture, a 262 year-old conjecture. 
        it is impossible to prove the goldbach conjecture in the manner in which 
        the theorists of mathematics have been demanding. instead of a resolution 
        based on algebra, an explanation of the goldbach conjecture based on the 
        numbers is required. in fact, this may be a simpler task than imagined 
        until now.

after posting the critique of einstein’s formula about the conversion of
                        massenergy on my web-site in december, 2011, i decided to consider the hydrogen
                        spectrum again. then an essay on the subject surfaced within my computer, one that i
                        had forgotten that i had even written back in 2008. so, i finally published this essay as
                        well about the rydberg constant [1.0973731568527]. its title: atomic spectral lines and
                        the rydberg constant: the lyman, balmer, paschen, brackett, pfund and humphreys
                        series (the 91.12 nm baseline for hydrogen)
                        numbers are important in physics. recently, i looked at einstein’s formula, e = mc-square,
                        and realized that when planck energy [1.9561] and planck mass [2.17644] are used
                        for the terms in that formula, the equation is a manipulation of powers of c,
                        the speed of light in vacuo: where energy is c to the 9th power; mass is c to the 7th power,
                        and c is c to the second power (squared) ---as powers are added in the equation . imagine that
                        planck energy (e) and planck mass (m) are simply fractal multiple expressions
                        of c (the speed of light in vacuo) to the 9th and 7th powers. this line of reasoning carries over into the study of spectral lines. first edition 2011. 42 pages.

the upper speed limit for a light photon is 299,792,458 meters/second. the square of 299,792,458 produces a numerical value that does not exist in any material sense of matter-energy. it is just a "big number" as some scientists hold, while others identify that number as only a "mathematical tool". johnson goes beyond a critique of albert einstein's famous formula based upon this unreal number. the rejection of the logic behind einstein's formula is explored through basic math, the summation of power's in the terms of the equation. this study also examines the powers of c (the measured speed of light in a vacuum) as contained in symbolic formulae of the planck constants for planck mass and planck energy.the planck constants are considered in light of c-square and other higher values for the exponents of mass and energy. first edition 2013. 229 pages.

the big bang theory debunked by its own reasoning: 
as illustrated in the popular scientific diagrams of the big bang 



the scientific diagram of the big bang theory of the creation of the universe reflect a purpose and intent of representing exactly what is purportedly to have existed. the critical evaluation of these diagrams and the theory they supposedly portray need to be questioned in a like manner of exactitude.
                      the question is whether the spacetime/motion coordinates presented in the diagrams are possible according to what we know about matter-energy as forms of spacetime. 
                      further, the theory of the big bang does not account for the apparent appearance or creation of matter in the cosmos, apparently from nothing. 
                      the big bang theory would presuppose the idea that whatever matter-energy was created at the moment of the big bang is what exists now and forever. 
                      its theoretical limitation is the restrictive interpretation of the transformation of matter-energy where it apparently appears to be created or re-created in some parts of the universe.... more

the 
      beal conjecture: ax + by = cz
a 
          proof and counterexamples
          [ax + by = zc]


the conjecture ax + by = cz made by mr. andrew beal is concerned with the common 
      prime factor for positive integers and their exponents. 

 "if ,ax + by = cz , 
          where a,b,c, x, y and z, are positive integers x, y and z are all greater 
          than 2, then a, b and c must have a common prime factor." [mauldin, 1997] this represents the original wording of the beal conjecture.

the beal conjecture requires positive integers 
        in the terms [a, b, c] and exponents [x, y, z] of the equation (the latter whose 
        value must be greater than 2). the products of the terms must reflect the selfsame 
        multiplication of the terms in whole numbers or positive integers. obviously, 
        no fractional expressions are to appear in any of the three terms or three exponents 
        of the equation. and, the most significant part of the conjecture affirms the 
        necessity that the terms share a common prime divisor. or, to the contrary, 
        present counterexamples.

the beal 
                conjecture: ax + by = cz a proof and counterexamples [ax + by = zc] 
the beal 
                conjecture and the limitations of algebraic notation


in our view, the concept of a counterexample 
      stipulated by the beal conjecture is simply impossible by definition. an equation 
      with co-prime terms cannot have positive integer terms and exponents, as stipulated, 
      given the very definition of primes and co-primes, and their multiples. if 
        a co-prime pair of terms (divisible only by the greater common denominator of 
        1) were to exist, then that would represent a counterexample in our view. now, the fact that the conjecture may wish to see a counterexample with 
      all exponents as whole numbers (as well as the terms) is simply expecting something 
      that cannot derive from co-primes and their relationship in the cited equation. 
      we shall explain the reason for this as of the concept of selfsame addition of terms.
the argument made in this essay is directed 
          at the system of notation that we have inherited throughout history, based upon, 
          in this case, the limiting method of selfsame multiplication of terms. in that 
          sense, these observations go beyond the beal conjecture. the insight posed by 
          mr. andrew beal in his conjecture serves as encouragement for looking at old 
          problems in a new light. we are simply attempting to peel back the first layer 
          of algebraic notation in order to emphasize the relations occurring behind the 
          symbolic language. and, in our mind, that is precisely what mr. beal has afforded 
          in launching such a critical conjecture.
