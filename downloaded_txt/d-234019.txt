my mushoom movie 2, (windows wmv 
	version, 56 mb)
my mushroom movie 2, (mp4 version, 245 
	mb)



in these and subsequent issues, i will be talking 
about the mushrooms found mostly between chester and quincy, in the northern sierras of
california. i may 
include mushroom recipes, anecdotes, and will try to feature at least one
locally available mushroom by linking to a page on the s. f. 
bay area mykoweb.com website.
to aid in understanding some of the terms used in my newsletters and  the 
mykoweb website, i have 
included a glossary, which was copied, with permission, from the mykoweb website.
i hope to get comments, favorite recipes, stories 
about memorable mushroom finds, and encourage anyone with a question about an 
unfamiliar mushroom to contact me. if possible, i will try to help you identify the 
mushroom and maybe include it in a future issue.



i can be reached at (530) 284-6241 
      (unless i am out hunting for mushrooms).
