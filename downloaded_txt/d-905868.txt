coastal testimonials stories from the shoreline 





 

participating in coastwatch‚Äôs shoreline monitoring program has connected me with the beauty of oregon‚Äôs coast on a profound level. it‚Äôs a privilege to contribute to its preservation and share my stories.
 -- sarah l., coastal enthusiast 



 

without the coastwatch program manager‚Äôs expertise in marine debris surveys, there is no way we would have made as much progress as we did with piloting and revising the marine debris mapping educator‚Äôs guide. students flourished while implementing the marine debris mapping protocol and teachers gained confidence as environmental educators. we connected teachers to resources and helped students meet standards in engaging ways, energizing our next generation of stewards through relevant citizen science work.
 -- denise harrington, noaa teacher at sea 2022, fellow 2023 



 

participating in the coastwatch in the schools program during the 2022-2023 school year had a transformative effect for students enrolled in two of my science courses: scientific writing and climate change biology.
 -- molly sultany, high school teacher, northwest academy, portland 



 

coastwatch is a program that provides amazing educational opportunities in the form of class visits and field trips for schools up and down the oregon coast. i worked with the coastwatch program manager last year and found the experience extremely valuable for my students.
 -- patrick farinholt, 4th grade teacher at kalmiopsis middle school  



 

the art and ecology workshop was definitely one of the highlights of my time in the program.
 -- annika bratton, curry watersheds partnership, now a 5th grade teacher at riley creek elementary  



 

i appreciated the coastwatch program manager‚Äôs enthusiasm, practical suggestions, and her extensive background knowledge about ecosystems along the oregon coast. over the past year, this initial meeting evolved into a vibrant, on-going partnership with coastwatch.
 -- molly sultany, high school teacher, northwest academy, portland 



 

thank you for creating the coastwatch in the schools program and initiating and leveraging oregon students‚Äô research to help educate all of us, while creating stewards of the future.
 -- barbara folawn, daughter of bob bacon, co-founder of oregon shores and lead campaigner for the oregon beach bill

we need your voice to pass the eelgrass action bill.eelgrass, oregon‚Äôs most common seagrass, plays a vital ecological role in the state‚Äôs estuaries. üíö an estuary is where freshwater from rivers and streams meets and mixes with saltwater from the ocean. üåä this marine plant roots into the mud and sand, and creates structured habitats that support salmon, dungeness crab, and water birds. beyond its ecological value, eelgrass helps mitigate climate change by storing carbon, reducing ocean acidification, and protecting coastal communities from storms and floods. however, this essential habitat is disappearing due to pollution, dredging, development, and sea level rise. we need to act now before it‚Äôs too late.to protect oregon‚Äôs eelgrass, a collaborative, grassroots movement is needed, bringing together local communities, sovereign tribal governments, and policymakers at all levels. the eelgrass action bill aims to do just that. we invite you to join us in writing to your legislators to profess your love of eelgrass and rocky habitats with a valentine‚Äôs day card. see the instructions:bit.ly/ooa_loveletterphoto credit: melissa ward

seagrasses sequester up to 18 percent of carbon stored in the ocean, capturing it 35 times faster than tropical rainforests, according to the world wide fund for nature. üíö seagrasses like the eelgrass that grows in estuaries in oregon, can also help protect our shorelines from damaging storms and erosion through dampening the force of waves. they‚Äôre also important ecosystems for juvenile dungeness crab and other commercially important species. ü¶Äoregon shores is part of a local movement to protect our eelgrass meadows, through our partnership in the oregon ocean alliance. through the alliance, we‚Äôre proposing new legislative efforts to protect these critical ecosystems. will you help us by showing your love for eelgrass? our friends at @surfrideroregon created ocean conservation-specific valentine‚Äôs day cards that you can send to your legislators in support of eelgrass protection. there‚Äôs also a helpful ‚Äúhow to‚Äù guide included. download them via the link in our bio. graphic: the pew charitable trusts

need some good news? newport is the first oregon coast city to formally integrate climate change into estuary management. on october 21st, 2024, the city council committed to revisiting the yaquina bay estuary management plan (ybemp) regularly to address sea level rise, natural resource changes, and development. this follows the council‚Äôs october 7th adoption of the first comprehensive ybemp update in over 40 years. ü§©this is a great start, but despite this progress, the plan lacks key amendments to ensure a climate-resilient estuary. oregon shores and other advocates pushed for stronger zoning standards to account for sea level rise, promote nature-based shoreline stabilization, and protect critical eelgrass meadows‚Äîessential for local fisheries and wildlife.the plan now moves to the toledo city council and lincoln county commission in 2025. stay tuned for ways to support a climate-ready yaquina bay, and see our recent interview with opb: think out loud, discussing this win (link in bio).üì∑: rena olson#oregonshores #protectthecoast #oregoncoast #coastalconservation #climateresilience #estuaryprotection

the oregon coastal ecosystems are at the heart of our state‚Äôs identity, economy, and environment. but they need your help.oregon‚Äôs rocky habitats, which make up 41% of the coastline, provide critical nesting grounds to over one million seabirds, habitat for hundreds of fish species including spawning areas for commercially important juvenile rockfish and dungeness crab, and are home for thousands of invertebrate species including sea stars, anemones, and shellfish.eelgrass meadows play a vital role in sequestering carbon, supporting marine life, and protecting coastal communities from erosion and ocean acidification. these habitats are the backbone of entire ecosystems, sheltering species from fish to marine mammals.we‚Äôre working to protect these essential habitats by supporting state agencies, community groups, and science-driven management efforts. your voice is critical to making this vision a reality. help us protect oregon‚Äôs ocean future. join us for an informational webinar: introducing the oregon ocean alliance: shaping ocean conservation through legislation, on february 3rd, from 6-7pm. rsvp via the link in bio.üì∑: @shifting_tides_nw#oregonoceanalliance #oregoncoast #oceanhealth #oregon #pnw

have you heard about the upcoming @winterwaterspnw series coming up in february? winter waters is an oregon-based organization all about encouraging people to eat local, sustainably caught seafood and farmed seaweed. as a conservation non-profit, oregon shores aligns with the mission of keeping local seafood local for multiple reasons:üêü when seafood lovers prioritize sustainable seafood, businesses and policymakers are incentivized to adopt better regulations and industry standards, such as quotas, seasonal fishing limits, and marine protected areas.üåä supporting seafood that is farmed or caught with minimal environmental impact (and kept in state rather than trucked or flown around the world) reduces greenhouse gas emissions, benefiting both the ocean and global conservation efforts.üíö sustainable seafood consumption raises awareness about ocean conservation issues, encouraging people to think critically about marine issues like climate change, plastic pollution, and habitat loss.learn more about winter waters events in oregon: winterwaterspnw.com#oregonshores #protectthecoast #oregoncoast #coastalconservation #sustainableseafood #oregonseafood
