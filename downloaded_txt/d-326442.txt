1968 mercury montego mx



april 16, 2003
 
well, it's been awhile since i've put in an update, but there really hasn't been too  much going on.
1.  got a new hood for my car.  it came off a 69 comet
2.  got a new dash pad (looks great).  no cracks, warps, splits...not even dry.  got it the other day
                           out of a 69 rag-top...it's black, but hey black goes with anything.
3.  got an old 302 out've a building that was falling in.  the 302 was complete except for the distribuator
                           and carb.  the heads, intake, oil pan, water pump, and timing chain all came off pretty easy.  the crank, pistons,
                           and cam were rusted badly.  i let them soak for awhile and finally got the pistons and crank out, but i found a crack
                           in a narrow piece of metal that comes down from the cylinder (it's not actually in the cylinder), so i don't know if it can
                           be repaired.
4.  i've taken the front seat out and all the carpet.  the floors weren't too bad.  i've sanded, cut,
                           and sealed.  they should be ready for patching now.

a 68 cyclone-i think this looks like a "fastback"
