attractions and activities
 



villa caribbean dream is situated on the most southern tip of the island and has extraordinary views of the caribbean sea and mountains. sunsets seen from the terrace are truly magical.you will find peace and seclusion, a breath-taking view from the sun terrace of our main house and private beaches just around the corner. we welcome lots of international guests, in the winter season in particular wind- and kitesurfers. but we also like to welcome nature travelers and people who would like to get to know the local life on this beautiful tropical island.our location is on the hill moule-a-chique in vieux-fort, which is not in the typical tourist center but away from the busy crowded bars and party areas . you will find it quiet, relaxing and truly a lovely natural setting. however, within a short drive you can enjoy 2 different wonderful beaches as well as a variety of delicious local and international cuisines. we have a local fresh fruit and veggies market and a nearby grocery store, which is about a 5 minute drive away. the beach also is only 8 minutes drive.it would really be best for you to have a vehicle to be able to easily access the many attractions offered in st lucia both near and far. but it is not a necessity… you could also take buses or taxis. we assist our guest with car rentals and taxis.

						thank you brigitte! villa caribbean dream was the perfect place for my family to stay for the night. the homes are located just about 5-10 minutes from the airport. they face the southern sea and the views are absolutely spectacular. brigitte offered us a yummy breakfast in the morning with the best mangoes i’ve ever had  you feel like you’re right in the middle of the jungle here — so secluded and only with the sounds of the birds to listen to. highly recommend!

						i can't say enough about brigitte and her property. at the airport, i was greeted by a professional car service who was waiting for me with my name on a sign. within minutes i was at villa caribbean dream. even though it was almost midnight, brigitte was up waiting for me. she was kind, friendly, and so very helpful. she even made arrangements for my day at gros piton with such professionalism and detail. the next day i was invited to join her and her friends for brunch. what a treat! the meal was delicious. my room was well air-conditioned with a large comfortable bed. bathroom and bedroom had clean towels and sheets. place was spotless! i must share the view from brigitte's property is unforgettable. the ocean  the garden  the sound of birds was the atmosphere i needed. although i traveled alone, brigitte's place felt likr home. she treated me like family. thank you brigitte!					


july 2024 






						we loved our stay with brigitte. she was helpful, kind, incredibly informative and had the best recommendations. the bed was comfortable, the a/c worked brilliantly and we felt right at home with brigitte. we took her offer up on breakfast, delicious, what a great chef! what i love most about our stay was brigitte’s approachability, knowledge of the island, her amazing network of contacts and her genuineness of wanting our trip to go smoothly and our heartfelt conversations. spectacular! thank you brigitte!!!

						an unforgettable stay.
we just returned from our wonderful trip to st lucia and had the pleasure to stay for 12 nights at the villa caribbean dream. for us it was the perfect accommodation. located in the hills between the caribbean sea and the atlantic, it offers fantastic views, a beautiful garden in a quiet and peaceful environment. the rainbow apartment is very spacious, with a kitchenette, which allowed us to self-cater, and a very comfortable king size bed. 
brigitte is a fantastic host. she gave us lots of useful information about the island and was very helpful. breakfast is delicious with many locally grown fruit and freshly baked bread. thanks to brigitte, we had the pleasure of lots of interaction with other guests and the surrounding neighborhood. we also greatly enjoyed the beach that is a short drive away, with wonderful swimming, a fresh breeze, plenty of shade and two local restaurants. an unforgettable stay.

						stunning location, amazing views, excellent host
my mum and i have just returned from a wonderful nine night stay at brigitte’s charming villa. the location was perfect for us, with amazing views, a beautiful garden, and our own cottage which had everything we needed for our stay. (we stayed in creole cottage)
brigitte was a fantastic host, she made us very welcome, helped us book tours, invited us to her weekly coffee mornings, and took us out to dinner with some of her friends. 
villa caribbean dream exceeded our expectations and we would definitely recommend it to others seeking a non- resort based holiday in a stunning, quiet location. thank you so much for a wonderful holiday brigitte! from bella and carolyn!

						authentic caribbean style and hospitality, tranquil setting, and so close to the airport!
i am a travel editor at a national magazine and was overnighting on beautiful st. lucia between visiting two other islands and discovered this charming gem of authentic caribbean style and hospitality! this tranquil little compound of old caribbean design cottages and bungalows overlooks the sea (and the famed pitons), and yet is just 15 minutes from the international airport! brigitte, the owner, was a delight and full of insights on the island, and served a delicious breakfast on her expansive, breezy porch. i loved this hidden gem and would totally return for more days.

						a sanctuary of peace & tranquiity on the hillside of moule a chique
my favourite parts of the guesthouse were the garden full of colourful flowers and the deck with the most amazing view over the sea. the sounds of nature at night are really fantastic. its the ideal place to relax with a good book from the bnb's extensive library and just chill out. i highly recommend the bnb's delicious breakfast and the lovely kind staff working there. by the way i travelled in july and needed no air con or fan in my cute little caribbean cottage.					


september 2023 






						look no further! perfect place to stay!
had a great time staying at brigitte’s little palace with the view that takes the breath away! 
after long and busy day of being a classic tourist, it was a bliss to sit on the terrace in the evening and watch those majestic sunsets. 
very clean and taken care of place. brigitte will make sure you will feel like home and help with arranging taxis or advising on shopping, travelling or dining. 

perfect place to stay no matter if you’re on holiday or in business. 
would definitely recommend to anyone that will plan to stay in vieux fort!					


july 2022 






						kiteboarding and diving trip to st. lucia
my husband and i travelled to st. lucia for 3 weeks in april to kiteboarding, scuba dive, snorkel and hike. we stayed at villa caribbean dream for the first 5 nights as it is close to the international airport and to a good kiteboarding beach. we found brigitte to be a very welcoming, friendly and helpful hostess! her accommodation is simple and clean, with the option to purchase a lovely breakfast or use the small kitchen available to guests to prepare your own meals. the verandah for meals has a beautiful ocean view and is a relaxing spot to meet other guests. brigitte goes out of her way to make sure each guest is comfortable! we enjoyed our stay here!

directions to villa caribbean dream 



unfortunately google maps or other sat navs send our guests always through a more complicated small off road. therefore here our correct directions:please drive to the end of new dock road shortly before the harbor. turn right up the hill to moule-a-chique. this road leads to the lighthouse. approx. in the middle (after a few housing complexes) there is a a blue neighborhood watch sign in a sharp bend and a right turn. the sign says “warning – neighborhood watch“. take that right turn please and keep left until you see a second same neighborhood watch sign. drive up the little hill at that sign (don’t go straight!). our property is the first one on the right side. it is white with a pink stripe around and  a blue and white lattice fence. you will see a garage under an apartment and our main house has a sign “villa caribbean dream”.i can give further directions on arrival if necessary. my cell number is +1(758)717-2908 











our team welcomes you 



your host brigitte and her friendly staff noelita and louis make a great effort to ensure you have an enjoyable and relaxing stay and feel truly at home.we speak english and german.

the “creole house” is a separate creole-caribbean style cottage. it boasts a lovely view of the caribbean sea, is very openly built and surrounded by a large beautiful terrace. it has it’s own bathroom, a queen size bed and a fully equipped kitchenette with fridge and all amenities. the large surrounding terrace includes a dining area and is decorated with tropical plants. the wooden louvre sliding doors open out onto the balcony.because of the open architecture the cottage is very well ventilated and also has a standing fan. 













 





rainbow-apartment 



the “rainbow apartment” lies somewhat more elevated than our main house (accessible via a small flight of steps). the caribbean colours give it, just like the creole house, a special flair. it is well ventilated through its very large windows and open architecture. beyond that, it captivates through the beautiful view of the caribbean sea. this air-conditioned apartment also has its own bathroom, a fully equipped little kitchen, tv and king size bed.the charm of “villa caribbean dream” automatically transfers over to those two apartments. the nearby gazebo in the tropical garden invites for reading or relaxation.
