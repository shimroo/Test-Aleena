beatles tours - from 2 hours to all day beatles tours, we have the right beatles tour for you. 

vip beatles tours for beatles aficionados with author david bedford, these tours are unique to us 







specialist tours second world war, 800 years in a day and the american connections







out of liverpool take a trip to the lake district or into north wales - so much to discover










on our all day tour and vip silver and gold tours, you get the chance to go inside the childhood homes of john lennon at mendips (above) and paul mccartney at 20, forthlin road. these homes are operated by the national trust, and we can include this tour within your beatles tour. the houses are not open every day so check with us first.


advice for  your beatles tour:  get your trip of a lifetime right!
if you are planning your trip to liverpool, and want a beatles tour, then you will be taken to see:
where ringo starr and george harrison were born, where john lennon lived with his aunt mimi at âmendipsâ and where paul lived at 20, forthlin road.


one of the hidden gems of the beatlesâ liverpool, you need to visit the casbah coffee club, the true âbirthplace of the beatlesâ.
go on a private tour and discover the incredible stories, with the club that john, paul and george helped to paint - and you can still see their artwork. donât miss it.


you will also see brian epsteinâs home, penny lane, st. peterâs where john and paul met, and strawberry field. you could take a quick bus tour or in a taxi too and see the popular places. 
however, we donât believe in giving you the tour we want, but the tour you want. 
we are different.




thatâs why our beatles tours have been designed by david bedford, author of the only book on the beatles and liverpool: âliddypool: birthplace of the beatlesâ. we even have vip tours where david can accompany you. one tour doesnât fit all. we have several unique options, so that you can choose the beatles tour that you want: just tell us where to go!
spoiled for choice? use our tour planner to tell us what you would like to do and we will recommend the best tour for you. why liverpool beatles tours? we were chosen by paul mccartneyâs film team to help with the pre-tour film on his âback in the worldâ tour, and showed may pang, john lennonâs former girlfriend, around liverpool too.





one of our vehicles - travel in luxury with us in our air-conditioned mercedes (right)
or choose a cheaper option in a taxi for a fab four taxi tour
