lake ogascanan is 15 miles long with numerous long, narrow, sheltered bays that
          provide interesting shorelines to fish. it gets its name from the native word for 
		  "fish
          hatchery". ogascanan
is a natural hatchery for walleye, northern pike and lake trout.

 important to know..... 





when
        you're looking for a quality fishing lake, ask these questions:










is the
            lake easy to get to?




are
            there towns close by?




are
            there private cottage leases?




are
            there year-round residents living on the lake?




is it
            a restricted area ... or is it free-public access?




are
            there other lodges/ outfitters on the lake?




is the
            fishery protected?








ogascanan is different ..... it's better ... and here's why:











remote - 2.5 hours on bush road - not cottage country!




no towns close by!





nobody lives there; we
            are the only land owners!





restricted access -
            controlled zone! no free-public access!





we are the only lodge
            operation on the lake!





the fishery is
            protected by law!








law prohibits winter fishing!
law demands the release of smaller and
            bigger walleye!







these differences.....










set ogascanan apart
            from many other lakes.




account for ogascanan
            being a better fishery than most.




ensure fisherman that
            time invested learning ogascanan, is time well spent.











the fish pictures in this
          website substantiate the fishery ... we show you quality and quantity. look through the site, check out the fish, and look again. our
          pictures are dated to show you an accurate representation of the fishing now.
          we hope you'll compare them with others. at ogascanan you'll have the opportunity to catch
          lots of fish and big fish ... and we're going to help you.

          lake with great fishing, ogascanan has it.
