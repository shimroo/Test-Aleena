@marisathetilechica ‚Äúit‚Äôs international women‚Äôs day, i want to make a big shout out to all the amazing women i know and to all the female trades women out there!. it was very challenging journey for me to become the confident tradesperson i am today. there is always going to be people who will try and tell you that you can‚Äôt, you won‚Äôt be good enough, you should just quit now. i just want to tell the women in the trade to keep going, it may be hard and sometimes you might want to give up, but you got this! show them you are talented, you are strong, you are smart, you are a tradesperson! female or male shouldn‚Äôt matter it is the skill you provide. üí™üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚úä #womeninthetrades#tradeswomenofig#womenofinstagram #proknee#stabila #madeinperth#incatileandmarble #tradieladyclub@mdouganze_incatile@trades_women_of_ig‚Äù‚Äîmarisa d‚Äôalimonte of inca tile & marble in perth, ontario

@fantumkarpets ‚Äúare they worth it? yes, even with a knee infection i can work today. the proknee pads take enough pressure off my knees and put it on the shins so that i can still work. ‚Äú‚Äî juan friesan of fantum carpets in canada
