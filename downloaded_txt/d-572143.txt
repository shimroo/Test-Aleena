what is in a name?
ireland bank. you’re probably asking yourself the question right now, “are they associated with the country of ireland?” ireland bank was founded in 1892 and our name comes from one of our founders j.n. ireland. in the nineteenth century it was customary to name a new bank after one of its founders. the new board of directors unanimously voted to name the new bank after j.n. ireland, the most senior of the founders and hence came the name of ireland bank. in fact, up until 1981 our name was j.n. ireland and company, bankers. spanning three centuries and multiple generations, we are proud of our heritage as idaho’s oldest state chartered bank. 






inspiring change, together we serve
employees from our magic valley branch joined forces with sleep in heavenly peace during their community building event. the twin falls community came together to build 100 beds for kids in the community who do not have one. every child deserves a safe and comfortable place to rest their heads at night and we are grateful to be able to make a difference in our community.
