testimonials





★★★★★

this place is a real gem in the heart of cincy. their shwarma was so delicious that i'm already hoping to go back for more! the hummus was excellent and the bread was warm and crisp! a little pricey but worth a lunch. street parking makes it easy on a weekday.

★★★★★

i had heard of andy's great food from several friends so when i had the chance i stopped by for lunch. andy's met my expectations.  the meal was delicious and reasonably priced.  everything tasted fresh and homemade and our waitress couldn't have been friendlier.  i'm already looking forward to another visit.

★★★★★

if you have been to the mediterranean, this place is legit.  great food, nicest people running a family business that makes you a part of the family when you visit.  the spanakopita is unreal!!  the hummus is real, not that clumpy stuff in the store, but smooth as silk!
