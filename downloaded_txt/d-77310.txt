welcome to wheatfarm.com
a
website about farming and mechanical stuff




Â welcome
      to my hobby site. this site was created to share my interest and
      enjoyment of farming and all things mechanical.
i've kept a journal
      for each year of harvest that i've worked as a combine and semi
      truck driver; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. i also have some pictures from the 1998 harvest that i helped with for a week. a comparison of some older gleaner
      models is here. here are some pictures of an early model gleaner.
      ever wonder what gleaners look like on a production line? know what a bankout wagon is? these are some pictures of the
      gmc
      general
      truck i drove hauling wheat the summers of 1999, 2000, and 2001.
      here are some pages about equipment i own or have worked on for
      friends: ford
      lt110 lawn tractor,
      allis-chalmers
      716h garden tractor,
      a box
      scraper
