zantrex 3 dangerous.  not use again. so far so good 17 feb 2006 - april of california, usa writes: i used this product for 2 weeks so far. i am 5-7. 124 pounds. i walk about 30 mins and workout about 1hr a day, 5 days a week. i eat around 1200 calorie a day. i bought zantrex-3 and was hoping to lose about 10 pounds. i don't drink coffee at all, so i decided to take only 1 pill a day before lunch. it makes me drink tons of water and decreased my appetite. i've noticed that i don't craving for sugar anymore. i kept my old workout plan but i didn't get the energy boost like many people did. i've been feeling extremly tired and sleepy the past two weeks.i had serious diarrhea the first week. however, just 1 pill a day, for 2 weeks, i lost 5 pounds already, i am really excited. highly recommend to people who's situation is similar to mine. i love it. 13 feb 2006 - adam of ohio, usa writes: i love this product. i started taking it 4 days ago, and lost 3 pounds. the first few days i only took 1 pill to get used to the high amount of caffeine, then i upped it to 2 pills. other than being a little jittery, that wears off after you eat a meal. my performance throughout the day is much better, i seem more attentive. i would highly recommend this product to everyone, just take it slow to begin with and you'll be good to go. good for energy 12 feb 2006 - victoria of nevada, usa writes: i've used zantrex-3 on and off for about a year. doesn't really help for weight loss, but i keep a few in my purse for when i find myself falling asleep at my desk. it doesn't curb my appetite, in fact, sometimes the nervous
