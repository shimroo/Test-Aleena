we had been searching for several months prior to working with the help company and had not had any luck, yet within weeks of working with them we had several great candidates who all honestly could have been a great fit. we ended up with an incredible employee who has exceeded all expectations.

the help company has helped me hire several household staff over the past few years and i cannot express how easy and enjoyable the entire process was. they took the time to really know me and what type of household we run and they sent very well qualified candidates. each time i hired quickly and easily and they are all incredible team members.

the help company has understood our evolving needs ever since we had our first baby in 2016. relatable, empathetic, and creative, they have come to our aid multiple times, thereby enriching our lives—and those of our children!

so many of the skilled, reliable, talented and loving people they have introduced us to have become permanent members of our extended family, starting from the time they’ve worked for us and extending long past it. i have always felt that the help company truly understands my family and our needs.

it all started with our own kids…


            our first client is also our founder, claudia, who, having set out in search of the world’s best nanny for her then-infant son, discovered that it was scarier and more complicated than expected. her own need became her calling and, 38 years later, claudia and her team are still matchmaking outstanding service providers with those in want of their help.
