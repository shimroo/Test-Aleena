about gulliverhi! my name is gulliver! i was eleven months old and one of seven pmu foals that lived in a pasture, on a pmu farm in north dakota. 
my owner had gone out of business because he lost his contract with wyeth pharmaceuticals, the big giant that makes the drug premarin. he searched and searched for homes for us, but i was at the highest risk of going to slaughter because everyone thought i was big and ugly!
