welcome to cambria mortgage, the joe metzler team. joe and his team are committed to helping you make a truly informed mortgage decision. our advice goes way beyond just quoting rates and fees. we provide you with a complete analysis of your mortgage debt picture through analysis and reports. most people don't understand the life changing differences between different loan programs, but we want to make sure you do.


with our low interest rates and low closing costs, you might be wondering about the kind of service or expertise you'll receive. you're in for a pleasant surprise. we've gone to great lengths to streamline the loan process and make it the easiest, most convenient experience imaginable. no appointment needed. no account numbers or shoe box full of financial papers. just the information that's in your head.


find out how good it feels to work with a lender that delivers on both price and service. read our reviews, then you'll know why we enjoys a 98.0% overall recommendation rating, which we'd like to point out is a far higher standard than mere satisfaction.



i have closed thousands of loans in my career. that's a lot! those customers contributed to our continuing success because they know we got them a better deal!



phone apps, robots, application clerks, and rockets don't care about you or your loan. it would be cool to just push a button and magically get a mortgage loan, but it really doesn't work that way, no matter what the tv commercial shows.


how can you be sure you are getting the best deal? we are in your corner. as the actual lender, home loans are all we do. we beat the banks, the big internet lenders, and the realtor's in-house lender everyday with our great interest rates on home loans, and personalized service from local professional licensed loan officers. 


cambria mortgage pros like joe metzler work directly with you to ensure you stay informed and on track throughout the entire performance.  we succeed when you succeed. our ultimate goal is to create lasting relationships by closing your home loan on time with a stress free process.


we can do the same for you! so if you are checking mortgage rates in our backyard of minneapolis, st paul, or all of minnesota, colorado, florida, wisconsin, south dakota, north dakota, iowa, we can help you get the lowest cost mortgage of anyone on your area, saving you thousands of dollars!

 


 top reasons you should have us help you:

we keep it simple for you! slick advertising is not our game. we are a top mn lender, and it's not just because of our low mortgage rates. its because we offer the whole package! we provides fully automated digital process, with all of the latest electronic signatures, secure document transfer, and instant approval systems. plus we even give you instant notification for each step of your loan with our smartphone app!
