focusas a boutique judgment recovery firm, we give individual attention to each case, unlike general collection agencies which deal in volume and thus struggle to spend the time necessary to thwart professional debtors. effective judgment collection requires finesse, strategic structuring, resources and patience. at the end of the day, assignment can be the solution for many beleaguered creditors.



patienceour firm takes a holistic approach, looking at the bigger picture and into the future. contrary to what may be touted online, it is a simple fact that some judgments, particularly large complicated cases, may take more time and resources than anticipated. absent low-lying fruit, we are prepared to invest in a long-term approach when necessary.



knowledgeour firm's ability is rooted in experience, intelligence gathering, and having talented specialists across multiple disciplines, underscoring that 'knowledge is power'. this, combined with resources, talent and determination, can stack the deck in a creditor's favor where previous hopes had dwindled. some judgments, however, are uncollectible, and all the effort and resources in the world would have no effect. it is thus important to know the difference.
