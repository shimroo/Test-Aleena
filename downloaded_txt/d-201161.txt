welcome to gullah tours charleston, sc 
the language was spoken by the lowcountry's first black inhabitants. the language and culture still thrive today in and around the charleston/beaufort, south carolina region. gullah tours explores the places, history, and stories that are relevant to the rich and varied contributions made by black charlestonians.
as the name implies, the gullah language, native to the charleston area, is featured on much of the tour. of course, if gullah was spoken throughout the tour, you would not understand, nor would you enjoy the beautiful and interesting sites of charleston. your tour guide, alphonso brown, is a native of rantowles, south carolina, a rural community of charleston, and is fluent in the gullah language and familiar with many of the gullah customs.
