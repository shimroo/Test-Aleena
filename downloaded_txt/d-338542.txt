utc
regions




utc’s u.s. regions are the focal point for localized networking and educational activities. utc member companies in the united states automatically become members of the utc region(s) in which they operate.
each of these regions has its own chairperson who is elected by the members of each region. each region sponsors a regional utc meeting and serves as an on-going resource for employees of utc member companies in that geographic region.
