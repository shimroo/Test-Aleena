supporting vulnerable children in southwest floridanew name, same missiona.n.a.’s friends serves abused neglected and abandoned children in southwest florida. formerly known as the guardian ad litem foundation – 20th judicial circuit, a.n.a.’s friends works tirelessly to provide these vulnerable young individuals with the support, care, guidance and resources they need to overcome adversity and build brighter futures.





    see our continued impact
  




























on any given day in south west florida (swfl) over 1,000 children are displaced due to abuse, abandonment, and neglect in their home. more than half are under age 5. spanning from newborn to teenager, these children have unique physical, social/emotional, educational, and normalcy needs. children typically remain in the foster care system for a year or longer and cannot return home to their parents until the court allows. while childhood is fleeting, each day feels like a lifetime to a child waiting to go home. these children need community, caregiver, and peer support to know their value and reach their full potential.



100% fulfillment for children's needs
