masoud yasami’s paintings, much like the works of caravaggio, delve into the exploration of reality through a unique lens that combines intuition and a deep engagement with the natural world. yasami’s intent seems to be not just to replicate the physical world but to capture the essence of reality through the interplay of light, shadow, and color, creating a compelling illusion that invites viewers to experience a deeper perspective.caravaggio is renowned for his use of chiaroscuro, a technique that emphasizes contrast between light and dark, enhancing the three-dimensionality of his subjects and instilling a sense of drama. similarly, yasami may utilize light and shadow to create depth and texture, evoking emotions and provoking thought about the nature of existence.both artists share a profound connection with their subjects; caravaggio often depicted biblical scenes with stark realism, while yasami’s work might reflect broader themes of existence, perception, and the interplay between the seen and unseen aspects of life.
