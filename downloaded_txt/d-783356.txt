who we are…



the allied construction employers association (acea) was incorporated in 1936 to represent union-signatory construction subcontractors in labor relations and other industry matters. acea is the collective, unified voice of union-signatory construction subcontractors in wisconsin. acea also manages the industry advancement program (iap) and provides resources for union subcontractors to improve their understanding and access to pertinent industry specific information. in 2021, after many years of working with legal counsel john nesse during contract negotiations, acea partnered with management guidance, llp (mgllp) to administer the association. this partnership has strengthened the financial longevity of the association and gives all acea members access to qualified legal counsel with experience in the labor relations, employment law, and construction law fields.



what we do…



the top priority for acea is providing solid communication for our employers when it comes to negotiating and understanding collective bargaining agreements (cbas) with local unions. since 1936, we have provided our members with contract administration services, including interpreting and publishing labor contracts, and helping them to navigate any grievance proceedings.
