100 years of innovation	
memories are many for four generations of the wooldridge family. it has been 100 years since the establishment of "wooldridge boats." it was 1915 when "grandpa" wooldridge (1896-1986) built his first river boat to make that first-ever float down oregon's rogue river.

another alaskan getting released into the wild!  there are good reasons these are one of our all time best sellers, taking you places you never thought possible, with the people you always wanted to get outside with.  these boats have loads of room for gear, fishing space, and what ever else you want to put in them.  lifetime of memories just waiting to be unlock.#wooldridgeboats #builttoughboats #pnwmadeboats#jetsled #riverrunning #outboardjetboat #fishingboat #shallowwater #shallowwaterfishing #shallowwaterjetboats #madeintheusa #adventure #nwfishers #builttough #workboat #agencyboat #wooldridge

we are very saddened to have lost one of the most amazing human beings we have ever known. richie underwood was definitely one of the good ones and we will miss him immensely. not only was he a respected elder in the quinault nation but he was a person that connected with everyone he was around. richie loved being outside and was a legendary fishing guide in the quinault washington area. those who knew him, loved his big heart and kind personality. he loved to share stories from his long list of lifetime experiences to anyone who would listen. when richie spoke, you listened. he was immensely wise with a wealth of knowledge but always humble. he was a proud quinault nation elder but, in our minds, he was an elder to any man no matter who you were. thank you for everything richie. our prayers are with you and your family.  - wooldridge boats

we have been getting a lot of questions about are aft helm boats lately, so we’re going to be sharing some of the cooler aft helm’s we’ve built in recent history.  to start off we have this 20’ alaskan xl.  the windshield on this guy was moved back 18”, allowing for a platform for bow fishing to be mount up front giving superb visibility and room for fellow archers or whatever cargo this customer may decide to carry. also worth noting the center door, not something you normally get on your average alaskan xl.  fish boxes, canvas top and curtains, and mercury 150 round out this fantastic package. #wooldridgeboats #builttoughboats #pnwmadeboats#jetsled #riverrunning #outboardjetboat #fishingboat #shallowwater #shallowwaterfishing #shallowwaterjetboats #madeintheusa #adventure #nwfishers #builttough #workboat #agencyboat #wooldridge
