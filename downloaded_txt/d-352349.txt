about us












some of our colleagues call us the “dream team”, and i think we’d agree with them! a real estate agent married to an interior designer. sounds like a match made in heaven, right? we think so, too. we met each other thanks to a client who had asked for both of our services, and we just clicked! sharing our stories, passions, life goals, and more over several dates made us realize that our paths were aligned. fast forward to now—we’re happily married and love doing what we do! we started this blog in the hope that all our readers will truly enjoy what we have to share and gain some interesting lifestyle knowledge along the way.
