experience the  magic of little gardens














of all the atlanta-area venues perfectly suited for spring and summer weddings, little gardens is nothing short of a masterpiece. while the venue might be named little gardens, there is nothing little about this place! with a capacity of up to 300 as well as ample photo-ops available in the lush manicured gardens, this venue makes a big impact on all those who visit. on a seven-acre estate in lawrenceville, georgia, this impressive house and ballroom sit grandly atop a hill, far removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown atlanta.  it boasts a large, enchanting outdoor ceremony space, with a picturesque waterfall pouring into a beautiful koi pond. in japanese culture, koi fish are a symbol of good fortune, and their presence adds to the feeling of eclecticism and originality found within this stately beauty. with its spacious rooms, large doorways, and modern character, little gardens brings the best of old and new. within the home, the upstairs features a luxurious bridal suite with overstuffed sofas, a floor-to-ceiling mirror, an original fireplace, and even an additional changing room and restroom. the upstairs also boasts a grooms suite with a private restroom and changing area as well. downstairs is the beautifully designed ballroom, enclosed in a wall of french doors that give way to the secluded garden, idyllic for an indoor-outdoor reception. no matter what season you’ve chosen to say “i do”, our garden is sure to be blossoming with gorgeous blooms all year round. if you’re searching for an atlanta-area garden wedding venue, look no further than little gardens!

 enchanted engagementsdon't just take our word. hear what our clients have to say.“we absolutely loved the venue, the waterfall, the flowers and the house. they were all just perfect for us! throughout the entire process we felt as though we were in great hands; we were definitely taken care of before, during and after our event. the food tasted and looked amazing! we loved everything. also, our wedding cake by magic moments was delicious! i loved my bouquet, the decorative flowers, and everything magic moments did. the overall result achieved the look and feel we were going for and event surpassed it.”jennifer & tylerlittle gardens
