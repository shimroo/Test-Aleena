a brief message about funding your venture. 
private placements (reg d offerings)
 did you know that a business plan is not enough to legally 
          raise capital? protect yourself and your investors with a private placement 
          memorandum (regulation d) that is required to conform with state 
          and federal securities law. make it easy for your investors! we 
          provide support for reg d offerings (click here for a sample) and integrate 
          your business plan into a complete financing package.

        before you go any further.
sample business plans 

        need a business plan, but don't know what it should look like?  we attracted investors and obtained 
          a bank loan package totaling more than $800,000 for a startup business, 
          just by rewriting its business plan and repackaging its documentation. 
          our  sample business plans are 
          actual business plans we've used to obtain funding for our clients. we 
          also provide integrated financial models 
        for various industries.

        radio station, with only $1,000 in hard cash, financing the rest. later 
        sold it for a $2.2 million, and a $1.1 million profit!

        turnaround strategies that saved them. we cut more than $18,000 a month 
        off a small company's overhead with no decrease in quality or level of 
        service. we also restructured a business with $1 million in sales but 
        a negative net worth and converted $3 million in debt to equity. then 
        sold it for $5 million. to analyze your business, take the  
        business/financial fitness test.
