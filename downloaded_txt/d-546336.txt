william james sidis (sigh-dis), a world-famous child prodigy said to have been a "prodigious failure," actually wrote many books, articles, and periodicals. he wrote using pseudonyms  because he abided by the principles of anonymous contribution and avoidance of fame. thus through his own choosing the media did not know of his highly productive life.  sidis  worked fulltime jobs and did his prodigious thinking and writing on his own time.
the w. j. sidis archive presents here all of his writings found so far: four books; four pamphlets; 13 articles; four periodicals (36 issues); 89 weekly magazine columns; a design for a corporation owned and operated by a federation of its employees; and one wonderful invention. also find here selected correspondence and financial documents. see also dr. abraham sperling's short bio of sidis; adam alonzi's  short bio; and dan mahony's compilation of materials for biographers failure?

w.  j.   sidis model of the universe





 dark matter consists of stars in the dark buildup phase of their eternal cycle
the universe is infinite and eternal
galaxies are distributed in an irregular three-dimensional checkerboard of positive and negative sections
"we thus find the universe to be made up of a number of what we may call bricks, alternately positive and negative, all of approximately the same volume; a sort of three-dimensional checkerboard, the positive spaces counting as white (giving out light), and the negative spaces as black (absorbing light)."—the animate and the inanimate, chap. xii

shapes of the "brick" sections are made irregular by harmonics

"the irregularity may thus be of two varieties: either      the medium pair of faces is caved in, and the largest and smallest bulged out somewhat less; or the largest and smallest pairs of faces are caved in slightly, and the medium pair of faces extremely bulged out."—the animate and the inanimate, chap. xii 


 


a rigorous examination of the second law of thermodynamics led to the sidis model.
" ... we come to the conclusion that the second law and its reverse are equally probable."—chapter 4

3-d checkerboard?  dark matter (blue) surrounding nprmal matter (red) and vice versa. this visualization from bicep2 is intended to represent the "first tremors of the big bang," but instead it illustrates well the sidis model. the blue areas represent the negative dark-matter sections, the red the positive ordinary-matter sections, each type surrounding the other as sidis predicted..
 

 




sidis re the stars
the universe is infinite and eternal.
stars exist in an eternal darkstar-lightstar cycle. 
galaxies are distributed throughout the universe in an irregular three-dimensional checkerboard of ordinary-matter spaces where they follow the second law of thermodynamics and expend light and heat, and dark-matter spaces where they reverse the second law of thermodynamics and build up heat and do not emit light.
dark matter consists of hot dark stars still in their galaxies and filaments.
dark matter makes up 50% of the infinite and eternal universe. " ... we come to the conclusion that the second law and its reverse are equally probable."—chapter 4
sidis's  theory is a consequence of the laws of physics, e.g., the first law of thermodynamics (energy is neither created nor destroyed).

animations of sidis irregular three-dimensional checkerboard model of positive sections (ordinary matter) and negative sections (dark matter), and alma model of same.
slowly, over epochs of time, the negative sections become positive sections again as their stars finish reversing the second law of thermodynamics (building up heat). then they begin following the second law expending light and heat again.

						meanwhile, the positive sections having expended all their heat go dark and begin reversing the second law.
 

sidis:
 " ... the negative sections must be completely surrounded by positive sections and must therefore be finite in all directions. by reversing this (since we have seen that all physical laws are reversible), it follows that any positive section must also be finite in all directions, and be completely surrounded by negative sections.."—the animate and the inanimate, chap. xii
 

3-d checkerboard?   dark matter (blue) surrounding   normal matter (gray) and vice versa


dark matter consists of hot dark stars still in their galaxies and filaments





  "our previous consideration on the production of radiant energy from the stars indicates that such production of radiant energy is only possible where the second law of thermodynamics is followed, that is, in a positive section of the universe. in a negative section of the universe the reverse process must take place; namely, space is full of radiant energy, presumably produced in the positive section of space, and the stars use this radiant energy to build up a higher level of heat. all radiant energy in that section of space would tend to be absorbed by the stars, which would thus constitute perfectly black bodies; and very little radiant energy would be produced in that section of space, but would mostly come from beyond the boundary surface.  ... if we were on the positive side, as seems to be the case, then we could not see beyond such surface, though we might easily have gravitational or other evidence of bodies existing beyond that surface."—the animate and the inanimate, chap. xii

  the animate and the inanimate
sidis starts out noticing something remarkable about the laws of physics: "among the physical laws it is a general characteristic that there is reversibility in time; that is, should the whole universe trace back the various positions that bodies in it have passed through in a given interval of time, but in the reverse order to that in which these positions actually occurred, then the universe, in this imaginary case, would still obey the same laws." astronomers are beginning to find the dark galaxies sidis predicted must exist. next they will discover the dark stars therein.
 

 
  the tribes and the states  100,000-year history of north america 
"the weaving of wampum belts was a sort of writing by means of belts of colored beads, in which the various designs of beads denoted different ideas according to a definitely accepted system, which could be read by anyone acquainted with wampum language, irrespective of what the spoken language was. records and treaties were kept in this manner, and individuals could write letters to one another in this way."
 
 
  notes on the collection of transfers
"this book is a description of what is, so far as the author is aware, a new kind of hobby, but one which seems on the face of it to be as reasonable, as interesting, and as instructive, as any other sort of collection fad. this is the collection of street-car transfers and allied forms. the author himself has already collected over sixteen hundred such forms, there being no duplicates included among that number; and he has found the process of collection, and the things observed during the process, both interesting and entertaining. he believes that others could get the same interest in such collection, even though it were made on a more limited scale."  the media industry, believing that this was his only book, proclaimed it evidence that sidis had "burned out."
 
 
  passaconaway in the white mountains "the young man who wrote this book commenced his explorations of passaconaway-land when four years old, at which mature age he climbed to the "turn of the slide" on mount passaconaway. with him it was a case of "love at first sight." he cannot remember when he did not love the white mountains. and with each succeeding year, that feeling has deepened. how the world looks from a beal-loved little mountain nestâ"score-o'-peaks"âthe youngster will tell. if, by his chapters, he shall succeed in imparting to some weary soul a tithe of the pleasure which has been experienced by one family during nearly a score of summers, i shall think that it was indeed a happy inspiration which led me to suggest to the lad that he record the things herein set down."

 re atlantis manuscript    lawyer's letter indicating publisher interest. 
"i received a reply from the mcclure newspaper syndicate. they are evidently interested in your 'atlantis manuscript'. they also mention the fact that the selling season starts right after labor day, and that therefore quick attention is advisable."

 
  re two more manuscripts 
dr. sperling's letter to helena sidis refers to a manuscript on philology, and another on anthropology, which he showed to a publisher. sperling wrote: "mr. mcdowell's comments on the manuscripts were these. both of them he thought were rather scholarly and thus would not lend themselves to publication for popular sale. he suggested that you have some one or more of the outstanding scholars in the the fields of philology and anthropology respectively read both manuscripts for the purpose of passing on their merits and suggesting possible agencies for publication. his feeling was that most commercial publishers would have the same reaction as he had and that you would do best through some educational agency or publication through a scholarly grant."
 
 
 the peace path [fragment] sidis wrote in a letter: "i am now writing something that i am entitling the peace path, on the old courier system and the many ramifications of its consequences in modern life. it seems to be rapidly developing toward book length, and it seems to have interested the few people who have had a chance to read as much of the manuscript as i have gotten ready so far."â1943.
 
 
   re guide books to the local transportation systems of boston and the district of columbia. "several volumes, including two for the boston area and one for the district of columbia, are now ready to go to the printer, and several more are almost ready." "we know of an unpublished guide book that has complete local transit and street-number information, as well as adequate maps; but it is no good to visitors as long as it remains unpublished." ... "according to an unpublished boston guide-book .... "

"the invention relates to perpetual calendars in which week-days can be found directly for any given date whatever; and its object is, first, to provide a means by which all such week-days can be looked up in a direct, simple and easily understandable manner; secondly, to avoid the cross-reference tables or complex mechanism, one or the other of which have hitherto generally been features of perpetual calendars providing means to look up the week-day of any given date whatever."

"the peridromophile is a paper issued primarily for the benefit of the followers of the hobby of transfer and token collection, and who consequently, from that point of view, have an interest in matters relating to local transit all over america. this paper was taken over by geprodis system on october 16 last, the paper itself having been operated since september, 1926. its connection with geprodis system was further strengthened by the fact that the geprodis perpetual calendar, the first unit to be taken over by the geprodis system, was a development of a "condensed calendar" which appeared in the peridromophile for january, 1927."--geprodis organisation news, feb., 1930
