				winter market postponed			

the la mart extends heartfelt gratitude to first responders for their bravery in battling the southern california wildfires. we also express our deepest condolences to those who have lost their homes or loved ones during this harrowing time.
 in light of these events, and in support of our community, we are postponing the la mart 2025 winter market until march 18-21, 2025, to coincide with our spring market dates.  
our showrooms remain open and available to buyers monday through friday, 9 am to 5 pm, providing a continued connection and support within our community. ❤️la
