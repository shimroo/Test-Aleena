club statementsblack lives matter the riverside boat club community stands firmly against racism.  we condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the excessive use of force by law enforcement against black and brown people, as well as ongoing systemic injustices such as mass incarceration and voter suppression. in particular, we condemn the unjust killings of george floyd, ahmaud arbery, breonna taylor, rayshard brooks, and countless others, both known and unknown.we are holding introspective conversations throughout the club about our previous failures to confront racism in our history and sport—and we commit to taking active steps to support access to rowing for underrepresented communities to ensure they feel welcomed and included at riverside boat club. read more…﻿
