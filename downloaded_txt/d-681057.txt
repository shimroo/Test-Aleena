a full service electro-mechanical job shop specializing
					 in design, prototyping, and manufacturing








our services
bmicad is your one stop shop for projects, offering innovative 
							electro-mechanical design services based on a design for 
							manufacture (dfm) approach. this includes completely integrated 
							mechanical and electrical analysis and thermal stress/strain 
							finite element analysis (fea). for a single component or a complex 
							system assembly, this approach allows detailed documentation and analysis of the design.






design

we follow design for manufacturing (dfm) guidelines utilizing autocad and solidworks to produce a 3-d image of the final product, turning your concept into a reality.






cnc machining

our advanced cnc machining capabilities deliver precise, high-quality parts with exceptional accuracy and efficiency, ensuring your projects meet the highest standards with consistent, repeatable results.






3d printing

the several 3d printers at our disposal allow us to bring your ideas to life. with a 14" x 10" x 8" build area, we can transform your 2d image into a 3d, usable part.






laser marking

with our 60w yag (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser, which etches images or logos onto your product, any material can be marked.






milling

manual and cnc milling/turning is performed using a 4-axis vertical mill, lathe mill, or cnc lathe. we offer advanced threading and tapping, to a resolution of +- .0001"






welding
