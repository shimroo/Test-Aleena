the toughest challenges lead to the greatest times of growth
when les stroud started his adult life’s journey 40 years ago, his goal was to connect people with nature in the most authentic way possible. 
through his adventures as survivorman, he was chased by a jaguar, lived through frigid sub zero nights, and has kept himself alive on 6 continents. 
and along the way, his work created an entirely new genre of television — survival tv. his time in the wild brought with it lessons about finding true resilience when faced with challenges, tapping into creativity to innovate better solutions, and unlocking the limits of what’s possible. 
there is a success instinct™ inside of each of us that allows us to assess any situation, adjust our outlook, and trust in our instinctual knowledge to overcome challenges, innovate, and forge a path to a better future.
