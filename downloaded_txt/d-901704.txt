welcome home to the lofts san marco  




 




a historic school building graduates to become the lofts san marco 















live / work / play 




 





originally built in 1916 as southside grammar school, the lofts san marco was purchased by cesery companies in 2001 and redeveloped into san marco’s first lofts (38 units of live / work / play project). while it is similar to those exclusive live / work lofts found in other metropolises such as new york, san francisco, seattle and atlanta, the lofts san marco definately has its own unique charm. the lofts san marco offers big-city-lifestyle and work space just outside of downtown jacksonville. located in the heart of san marco, the lofts has an eclectic neighborhood feel and is only walking distance from the st. johns river, san marco square, and downtown jacksonville. the loft’s design offers a variety of one-level floor plans and unique two-story units. there are also three newly constructed, aia award-winning townhomes with garage, hardwood floors, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, washers and dryers, and more.
