brenda was on the ball because she realized i had booked my departure incorrectly and was flying into the wrong airport for the tour. she called me at home and i was able to correct it with the airline at no additional cost to me. i was very thankful !

i wanted to send you this brief note to tell you what a great job gabriela has done in planning our trips over the last four years.   she is efficient, courteous and promptly responds to requests.  she goes above and beyond and researches various trip options while trying to get us the best deal. she has saved time and money and makes her clients feel valued and appreciated.
 
thanks to her, i have not had to haggle with travel and airline companies about trip details or prices.     
 
your company is very lucky to have her as an employee.   i wish her continued success with your company.

we cannot begin to say what an excellent job that our travel agent, cheryl has always done for us, she consistently does an outstanding job. we are not seasoned travelers and she has always been very patient with us. when we inquire about anything her response is both rapid and fitting. if we were to able to travel more she would be our first choice to utilize due to her fine attitude and talent.
