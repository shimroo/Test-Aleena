freeze dried rose petals
our freeze dried rose petals will add an elegant touch to your wedding.  instead of bird seed or bubbles, use freeze dried rose petals to toss when exiting the church.
they are a natural, biodegradable product, so clean up is easy. 
				in addition, you can use them for flower girl baskets since they 
				are much less likely to stain than fresh petals. table 
				decoration is another popular use, our petals make an excellent conversation piece.when using the freeze dried rose petals for tossing, cones are a great way to distribute them to guests!

				packs of 1000 petals for your large volume needs. whether you

welcome, we're glad you found us!  please take a moment to browse our website,
 you'll be pleased to find we have the best selection of quality petals available.  
what sets us apart from all the other websites selling rose petals?  for 
starters, we're not just a website.  at our 7400 square foot building 
located in a corporate park, we do it all, from customer service and order 
processing, to freeze drying and warehousing.  we are direct importers 
of silk rose petals, made to our specifications.  what's more impressive, 
however, is our freeze drying process.  we literally take thousands of real roses 
every week and turn them into beautiful freeze dried rose petals.
if you have questions, please contact us.  send an email and you'll 
receive a response from the president of the company.  give us a call and 
you'll speak with someone who handles petals all day long.  we are 
experts in our field, in business since 1998.  we don't sell a full 
assortment of wedding supplies, party favors, etc., we just focus on rose 
petals, along with organza bags to package them in.  we do, however, have a 
great deal of experience assisting wedding decorators, so you can count on us to 
assist you in making your event special.
we just added several colors to our line of
artificial rose petals. these are great 
for a bride on a budget looking to cover large areas.  we will also be 
expanding our line of freeze dried in the coming months.
