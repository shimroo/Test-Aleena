what people are saying about our team:



sally janavicius
22 job openings

"i just wanted to report that my experience with cybercoders, my first, was amazing. sally janavicius was so professional, responsive and informative that i was completely blown away by how awesome the experience was. i almost wish i was jobless again (no i don't).  
the backstory is that i applied for a role, but it was filled. a couple of months later, the role came open again and sally reached out to me. what luck!"
melanie c, trust & safety manager
