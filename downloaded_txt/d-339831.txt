"i'm compromising too," they said.





"oh," i replied, "tell me how you're compromising, to help me better understand and then we can find some middle ground."[unsaid: because in the 4+ years i've been taking care of your finances, food supply, refuse disposal, correspondence, medication, medical appointments, blood pressure monitoring, trying to dig out your home from 40+ years of neglect, and in the 2+ years i've been doing this, by myself daily, i haven't noticed anything resembling compromising on your part.]  "i'm aging in place.  i'm not in long-term care where you'd have to visit me every day."it's been over a week since this exchange took place.  and i still am unable to digest it.

was it something i said?





dear mom at school:

three times this school year, we've chatted amiably at pick-up time.  and three times now, a third mom has approached us.  each time, in mid-conversation you've turned your back to me to talk with the third party (different person every time), and ignored me for the duration.

i know that hanlon's razor states that one should:

never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity*.

* or in this case lack of manners. 

but it's starting to feel personal.  ya know?

cut it out.

yours,
m.

tired of the affirmations yet?





from hay house:

today i will let go of my need for approval and my need to be liked. instead, i will choose to like and approve of myself. the people who count (including me) will respect me when i'm true to who i really am.

another affirmation





another affirmation from heal your life:

i release all feelings of worry and guilt.

throughout life, the two most futile emotions are guilt for what has been done and worry about what might be done.

what else am i going to have to teach at home?





some people belive that cursive is still part of the school curriculum.  from the toronto star:

it was always my 
understanding that the “examples” provided at any grade level for any 
specific learning expectation were based on what students should be able
 to do at that particular grade level.  

on page 72 of the 
current ontario ministry policy document for language arts the example 
provided for grade 3 expectation 3.7 says (e.g. use legible printing and
 some cursive writing, etc.) it is incumbent on teachers to make sure 
that students are able to do all of the examples provided. 
 

teachers are required 
to assess students’ knowledge and skills and provide instruction and 
practice so that students can acquire and master them. cursive writing 
is included in every 3.7 learning expectation from grades 3 through 
grade 8 in the ontario language arts policy document. 

there is definitely an
 expectation that cursive writing be taught in ontario schools. cursive 
writing was used as an example rather than as a separate learning 
expectation to underscore the need for students to master a range of 
ways to communicate including the use of technology. 

read more.

interestingly enough, i've yet to find a teacher who interprets the text as it's explained above.  

*sigh*

today





from heal you life:

today i will tell myself that who i am is okay, and that what i'm doing is good enough. of course i make mistakes and get off-track sometimes, but that doesn't mean that i'm not as good as everyone else. no one is perfect, and that's just fine.
