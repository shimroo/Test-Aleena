president’s message

linda terrill property tax law group, llcthe country now seems to be slowly recovering from a deep recession, which severely impacted real estate tax values. across the country assessors are thus beginning to increase assessed values to – in their view – better reflect the realities of our post-recession market. this phenomenon will therefore require close attention to the new values being issued to make certain they do, in fact, reflect this slow real estate valuation recovery. our member firms are on the forefront of the legal precedents and valuation methodologies to address these assessment increases and stand ready to assist property owners in evaluating, and if necessary, contesting these revised values.
