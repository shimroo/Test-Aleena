						“education is our foundation” 						

 this is the core principle upon which industry pioneer, peter brunelli, founded universal imaging, inc. in 1974. peter recognized the importance of pairing imaging technology with training and education. only then could equipment consistently produce the highest quality imaging for precise diagnoses.
universal held its first ultrasound education course over 30 years ago and we currently conduct, administer, or sponsor over 100 credited continuing education courses each year. whether you purchase equipment from us or simply seek further insight or updates on the latest innovations, the universal team is always here to support you. we are very proud to say that peter’s legacy continues to guide us.
