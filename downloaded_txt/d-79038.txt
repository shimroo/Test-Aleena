​authentic psychic medium, psychic joy has retired. please visit to learn more.​indianapolis psychic medium






joy has been described as one of the most authentic psychic mediums of our time.​certified in psychic mediumship, joy has been helping seekers just like you for over 25 years.over time i have come to realize that the psychic medium sessions i do is not the thing i do but the thing that happens in you when i do them. the love, warmth and supportive environment from all of you that i have read for has been amazing. being able to connect with loved ones on the other side and help bring you closure, raise awareness and give guidance based on your issues is a gift. i cherish it and thank you for allowing me to do my life work. unfortunately due to health reasons i need to retire.  cancer sucks! i have not been able to work and unfortunately i am asking for your help with my general expenses. if you want to help it is greatly appreciated. please help at this link.
















excerpts from feedback about joy's psychic readings from clients just like you.
my reading was so exact. i actually felt my mother with me. what a wonderful psychic.
joy has been the only consistently accurate advisor for me. she has brought thru touching information from my grandmother and she channels very high and clear guidance.
truely a wonderful reading. she reminded me of psychic medium john edward. she has the gift. call her, words cannot explain....
i've tried a few other psychics but i keep coming back to joy. she picks up the vibrations, interprets them and gives rock-solid advice.
absolutely phenom... it's as if i am speaking to somebody who has known me my whole life and knows my every thought. thank you joy for putting things into perspective for me...again...it is so needed for me sometimes to speak with you to bring the "big picture" together again.
thanks you joy for your help. you set my mind at ease regarding my father's passing and helped me connect with gran as well. no wasting of my time and i was able to validate much of what you said. thanks again.
wow, if you have her go check the "other side" for you be ready to take notes, and fasten your seat belt. amazing. thank you.
i ordered a private reading with joy and i have to say it is one of the most wonderful experiences i have had in this lifetime! not only did joy connect to those closest to me that have crossed over, but the validations were amazing. no one could have know the things that were coming through....
i had the honor of having my late husband brought through by joy. what she gave to me can never be replaced as i have not seen him since we married and he passed in desert storm. she gave me closure as well as connecting us for a brief moment that will last an eternity.
i was truly amazed. this was the first time i have ever had a reading. she told me things about my situation and everything that was told to me ended up taking place. it was well worth it and will definitely call back soon to have another reading with joy.










joy's gift allows her to touch into your vibrations and channel information specific to your needs at a given time. explore all aspects of your life. ask your questions. find closure where needed. for many, the loss of a loved one leaves unanswered questions, unfinished business, or unresolved issues. our loved ones on the other side really do stay connected with us from spirit. their energies, levels of consciousness, states of awareness, never really dissolve into thin air, but stay unified and inner-connected. they are aware of what is happening in our lives. they communicate and convey their presence in their own mysterious way. all we have to do is pay attention, listen, and open our hearts to receive.joy has been described as one of the most authentic psychic mediums of our times. she receives and conveys messages with profound accuracy giving names, dates, events you can validate. she channels information from loved ones crossed over in a positive light with amazing clarity. joy touches into your energy soul to soul and gives what comes thru. she does not use divination tools such as tarot, crystals, runes, astrology, etc. joy's work as a psychic medium is her life work, and her way of helping all who seek answers. since 1999, joy has provided thousands of clients with in-depth psychic readings and helped professionals and laymen alike on their spiritual path. joy earned her certification in psychic mediumship as a student of the sandy anastasi psychic development system. alumni include famous psychic medium john edward and other authentic mediums.i want to thank all of you and wish you the best as time moves forward. there are very few authentic psychic mediums and i am not able to refer you to other psychics. search for and find authentic psychics that you are drawn too. when the time is right, it will happen. love and light, joy
