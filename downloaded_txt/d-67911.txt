				samizdata quote of the day – churn and change samizdata illuminatus (arkham, massachusetts) · economics, business & globalization · slogans & quotations competition has utterly transformed telecommunications after the state post office monopoly was ended. the same happened with deliveries when amazon came along with an innovative service. uber and airbnb have each transformed their markets.
that is how competition works. it is schumpeter’s creative destruction. like evolution, it works by a selective death rate. it is not who owns the production, it is how easy it is for potential competitors to gain access to the market. growth, productivity and innovation are driven by competition. producers vie to satisfy the consumers, and those who do so survive, for a time, over those who do not.
one thing that competition ensures is change. it leads to a dynamic economy, just as its absence leads to a static one.

				a new concept: how money vanishes from the earth if rich people are allowed to keep it johnathan pearce (london) · economics, business & globalization in all the calls i come across from the left, it is not often to find examples of how rich people are attacked because if they are allowed to keep more of their wealth (even if is legitimately acquired and without coercion), the money disappears. forever, kid. it’s lost.
yes, you read that right. the money vanishes into a black hole. an argument against “trickle-down” economics (which is a term no serious free marketer i have heard of actually uses) is that nothing “trickles” anywhere. apparently, there is this place, someone on earth, where money is just sitting around, gathering dust, all on its unproductive exile, just waiting to be rescued by a benevolent state so it can be put back into work. it sounds like a first draft of the plot from the count of monte cristo and the bit about the secret treasure that edmond dantes discovered and used to persecute his foes.
why do i mention this bizarre idea? because i read it defended and set out in a book, the future of finance: the rising tide of fintech lending and the platform economy, by francesco filia and daniele guernini, (whitefox publishing, 2024). the book is a mostly informative account of how modern digital technology is changing finance. it talks about the role of  blockchain; decentralised finance (defi) and other developments. it has lots to commend it if you want to understand these ideas, and the use cases in finance for technologies such as ai. but…some of the economic contentions in the book are bonkers.
for example, the authors claim that “we know” that wage growth and equality drive economic growth. (no clear evidicence is given for this contention.)  they argue that wage growth continued for about 100 years until 1970, when it apparently stopped.
however, that begs the question of whether there was a lot of equality in that period. was there a lot of equality, in relative, equality-of-outcome terms, during the “gilded age” of the rockefellers, carnegies and the rest? (there was not, but the rising tide of wealth nevertheless was considerable.) was there much of that during the 1920s? i suspect that equality, brought about by steeply progressive tax rates (and they caused issues) did not really manifest itself greatly until after ww2, and even then, given exemptions and other forces, american society in some ways was less egalitarian than in western europe.
the authors argue that a labour shortage drove this wealth growth, but surely, absent the restrictive and destructive impact of labour union restrictive practices, it was superior capital investment, and hence superior productivity, that meant tight labour markets coexisted with rising real wages in certain countries. (west germany rapidly overtook the uk, and it was a country where income tax rates kicked in at higher levels, unions were less obstructive, and there were fewer price controls under the adenauer administrations than, say, the uk.)  the authors make no reference whatsover in this part of the book to investment in capital. but it is total factor productivity (physical capital, human capital, etc) that makes the difference  over time to income growth. the us labour market was, relatively, less unionised in the post-war period than the uk one, for example, but the standard of living in the us rose relatively faster, as milton friedman pointed out in his book, free to choose.  
the idea that real incomes have somehow stagnated because wages have stopped rising ignores what might have caused that stagnation. i argue that they get causation back to front. if it is a shortage of labour that causes wages to rise, then surely, absent state intervention, capital will flow into machinery and the like to make up the shortfall, and such a country will also attract immigration (hopefully, of the sort that adds value via skills). in the us, as recounted by alan greenspan and adrian wooldridge in their masterful account of american capitalism, that’s exactly what happened. during the 19th century, even before the us civil war, the us saw tremendous growth of labour-saving devices to handle this labour shortage issue. for instance, the mccormick reaper-binder, singer sewing machine, and more. light bulbs, early air conditioning…you name it, have also increased returns on human labour because light bulbs allow 24-hour shift work; ac enables places that are otherwise stinking hot to be more economically viable, and so on. and this capital equipment made us workers more productive and increased their real income, other things being equal.
but it is on page 64 that filia and guernini ramp up their error wholesale and put forward what i call the “consumption theory of wealth”, which puts spending, rather than investment, innovation and creativity, as the cause of why we are better off: i am going to quote a passage in full:
“when employees and ordinary people (as opposed to odd people, ed?) have more money in their pocket, they spend it. the go out and spend money in restaurants and bars or entertainment venues, they buy new cars or modernise their homes. as a result, that money goes into the real economy to create demand for goods and services and helps businesses prosper and the economy to grow. but when already wealthy people and business owners keep more money via tax cuts, that money is squirrelled away. it’s dumped in offshore trust funds to minimise tax till further or it’s used in stock buybacks. it never reaches the real economy. all it does is to create even greater inequality.” (my emphasis in bold.)
so, if a person saves any money or “squirrels it away”, it is potentially gone.  the idea that savings are important, and a source of investment, is totally absent in this account as several on this blog such as paul marks regularly point out, a problem in many modern economies is that when investment is financed by central banks’ printing of money, and not real savings made possible by foregoing consumption, it bids up the factors of production, and that without injecting yet more funny money to keep the party going, there’s a crash. the importance of savings cannot be overstated in making sustainable growth possible. the authors claim, with no real evidence, that if money is salted away in a low/no-tax jurisdiction such as the cayman islands, mauritius, jersey or dubai, that this money disappears. it’s gone. but that’s plainly rubbish: that money is invested. why else put it offshore? even if that money is put into government bonds, that is lent to someone to finance something.
it is true those who use such jurisdictions hope to reduce their overall tax, and in many cases, they defer tax burdens rather that remove them. after all, a person may still want to repatriate their wealth eventually, for whatever reason, and they pay tax on it when that happens. they could, i suppose, give it to charity – but then that money will also go into the “real economy”.
but the idea that money that is not taxed goes out of existence is beyond bizarre. i don’t even know if thomas piketty, the french academic who called for progressive taxes and assaults on wealth, went so far into arguing that rich people’s money just vanishes from “real economy”.
anyway, apart from page 63 and 64, it is a decent book.

				calling out europe’s repressive hypocrisy perry de havilland (prague) · international affairs · slogans & quotations i say “ourselves” because i fundamentally believe that we are on the same team. we must do more than talk about democratic values; we must live them. within living memory of many in this room, the cold war positioned defenders of democracy against much more tyrannical forces on this continent. consider the side in that fight that censored dissidents, that closed churches, that cancelled elections—were they the good guys? certainly not. and thank god they lost. they lost because they neither valued nor respected the extraordinary blessings of liberty: the freedom to surprise, to make mistakes, to invent, to build. as it turns out, you can’t mandate innovation or creativity, just as you can’t force people what to think, what to feel, or what to believe.
unfortunately, when i look at europe today, it’s sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the cold war’s winners. i look to brussels, where eu commissars warned citizens that they intend to shut down social media during times of civil unrest the moment they spot what they’ve judged to be “hateful content.” or to this very country, where police have carried out raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist comments online as part of “combating misogyny on the internet,” a so-called day of action.
i look to sweden, where two weeks ago the government convicted a christian activist for participating in quran burnings that resulted in his friend’s murder. as the judge in his case chillingly noted, sweden’s laws to supposedly protect free expression do not, in fact, grant (and i’m quoting) “a free pass to do or say anything without risking offending the group that holds that belief.”
perhaps most concerningly, i look to our very dear friends, the united kingdom, where the backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of religious britons, in particular, in the crosshairs. a little over two years ago, the british government charged adam smith-connor, a 51-year-old physiotherapist and an army veteran, with the heinous crime of standing 50 meters from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes—not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own. after british law enforcement spotted him and demanded to know what he was praying for, adam replied simply that it was on behalf of the unborn son he and his former girlfriend had aborted years before.
the officers were not moved. adam was found guilty of breaking the government’s new “buffer zones” law, which criminalizes silent prayer and other actions that could influence a person’s decision within 200 meters of an abortion facility. he was sentenced to pay thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution.

				samizdata quote of the day – recovering the west’s mojo edition johnathan pearce (london) · slogans & quotations · uk affairs “our problem in the west, i believe, is that we got into a vicious circle of decline. our victory in the cold war removed the pressure to remain productive and to constantly demonstrate the superiority of the western model of free markets and free nations.”

he refers to a new essay he has out to coincide with the alliance for responsible citizenship (arc) conference that has been going on in london. i think it is a worthwhile read.

				‘i was a green energy zealot – until i had a nightmare heat pump installed’ natalie solent (essex) · environment · political economy · science & technology · uk affairs the title of this post is taken from the title of this telegraph article:
all paul robinson really wanted were some solar panels on his roof.
the company director, who had recently moved to a quiet market town in mid wales, is a firm believer in green technology. in the 12 years before he moved, he had benefitted from solar panels and a home battery, both of which shaved money off his power bill.
the government offers homeowners grants towards solar panels through its energy company obligation (eco4) scheme. but to take advantage of the generous initiative, robinson was also required to install an air source heat pump, an endeavour that proved to be more trouble than it was worth.
“i’m so glad i didn’t pay for any of it,” he says. “the amount it cost is crackers.”
robinson estimates that around 18 tradesmen – a team of electricians, plumbers, plasterers, and supervisors – descended on the stone barn conversion in welshpool, with the entire installation costing at least £40,000, according to estimates seen by the telegraph.
mr robinson is understandably glad he didn’t pay for any of it.
uk taxpayers, are you glad you did?

				samizdata quote of the day – usaid’s demise is nothing to mourn perry de havilland (prague) · slogans & quotations at the request of us president donald trump, elon musk and his department of government efficiency (doge) have been through usaid’s books. there they claim to have found an organisation funding myriad dubious campaigns and groups around the world. among many other activities, it’s been backing drag shows in ecuador and transgender operas in colombia. it’s dished out $84million to chelsea clinton through the clinton foundation. it also gave $54million to the controversial ngo, the ecohealth alliance, which collaborated with the notorious wuhan institute of virology in ‘gain of function’ experiments that are alleged to have made covid-19 more transmissible.

				samizdata quote of the day – covid inquiry actively suppressing evidence perry de havilland (prague) · health & medical · science fiction & fantasy · self ownership · slogans & quotations · uk affairs it is notable that the inquiry’s concentration on the work of the government’s dis- and mis- information operation assumes that anyone questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines is spreading such information. in reality the main source of dis- and mis- information is the government: the manifest failings of the mhra have been concealed; the safe and effective narrative is a sham.
i have yet to see any news report of the meeting but hope one will appear somewhere. i also hope that transcripts of the speakers’ presentations will become available. i note that the perseus group has made several witness statements to the hallett inquiry; whether these have been put on the inquiry website is a little difficult to determine, as the ‘statements’ tab leads to a list which is 809 pages long. i got through the first five without finding anything sensible buried among the trivia. maybe the submissions are there somewhere. somehow i doubt it.

				can the uk have a tech industry? rob fisher (surrey) · civil liberty, law & regulation · economics, business & globalization uk government tech policy must become libertarian, writes preston byrne.
the government wants to boss tech companies around, but it might not get its way any more, because the market is small, tech companies are mobile, and:
…the permanent bureaucracy in the united states which might otherwise have helped the uk apply informal pressure on americans who dared to disobey its decryption and censorship edicts – none of which, it bears mentioning, are enforceable against an american who refuses them and is happy to avoid setting foot in british territory – is gone.
we should adapt.
if the uk chooses to be the worst place for an ai company, or a social media company, or a digital asset company to incorporate and do business, it will find that it has very few such companies. regardless of your opinions on how british society should be structured, the nhs, immigration, or the appropriate quantum of social welfare, if you don’t have high tech employers generating revenues and paying taxes, social programs become very difficult to pay for.
will we get a government capable of making this realisation? or will we continue to self-destruct?

				“blasphemy laws are incompatible with free speech” natalie solent (essex) · civil liberty, law & regulation · deleted by the woke media · media & journalism · middle east & islamic · religion · uk affairs “blasphemy laws are incompatible with free speech”, writes tom harris in the telegraph.
the government is known to disapprove of the term “two-tier”, especially when applied to policing, in which case, says a recent home office report, it can be a telltale sign that you’re of the “far-right”. isn’t everything? 
i shouldn’t have laughed at that, but i did.
yet in the last few days we’ve had a perfect example of how our laws are written to be, and correctly interpreted by judges as, two-tier, meaning that they are laws intended to offer different levels of protection and punishment to different groups of uk residents, depending on their faith or ethnic origin. 
martin frost of manchester chose (ill-advisedly, i might add) to burn a copy of the koran in public, live streaming the event, in response to his daughter’s death at the hands of hamas terrorists on october 7, 2023. 
it is notable how many media outlets skated over the fact that hamas murdered martin frost’s daughter. you might think the telegraph’s phrasing (“her death at the hands of hamas terrorists”) was mealy-mouthed enough, but just compare it to this itv report that said, 
the “trigger” for his actions was the death of his daughter in the israeli conflict which had affected his mental health, the court heard.
note the scare quotes around the word “trigger”, the words “the death of” as if she died a natural or accidental death, and the reference to it occurring in “the israeli conflict”. not the hamas conflict, not the gaza conflict, not even the israel-palestine conflict, but the israeli conflict. 
tom harris’s article continues,
he [martin frost] claimed also to have been protesting at the murder of iraqi asylum seeker salwan momika who was murdered in his apartment in stockholm after he performed his own act of koran burning for his internet audience. 
forst [sic] pleaded guilty to charge of “racially or religiously aggravated intentional harassment or alarm by displaying some writing, sign or other visible representation which was threatening, abusive or insulting thereby causing that or another person harassment, alarm or distress.” that charge is contained in the text of the crime and disorder act 1998, introduced by tony blair’s government. 
the old blasphemy laws may have been consigned to history decades ago, but they were replaced in 1998 by new ones: it is widely accepted that muslims take very seriously the physical abuse of their religion’s holy book and are known to feel personally offended by any disrespect shown towards it. similarly, most muslims also take personal offence at any physical representation of the prophet mohammed, hence the outcry against the teacher at batley grammar in 2021 who did exactly that by showing his pupils a cartoon depicting islam’s founder.
that teacher is still in hiding.
in modern britain, islam and the koran are protected by the law, by the courts and by the police. christianity is not. that is not an argument that christianity should receive equal protection; it is an argument that islam should receive the same level of legal respect and protection as christianity – ie, none. two-tier protection is unacceptable because it equates to two-tier freedom of expression, freedom to criticise one religion but not a different one. 
yes. to forestall criticism that just saying “yes” adds little of value, i shall try to give better value by amending it to “yes, yes, yes!!!”
we can imagine the horror that police officers, court officials and politicians must have felt when legal proceedings didn’t go their way in the case of jamie michael, an ex-royal marine who had served his country in iraq but whose anger at the southport murders of three young girls last summer led him to upload an ill-advised rant against illegal immigrants that a member of staff working for a labour ms (member of the senedd) felt so offended that they just had to report it to the police.
i would not have guessed that someone working for a labour member of the welsh government actually did have something worse to do with their time than their day job.
 a jury took less than an hour of deliberation to acquit him. 
the terms mr michael used were obnoxious and unpleasant. but as the jury agreed, that should not impinge on his right to free speech.
juries often do things like that, even now. that’s why “progressives” keep whittling away at the jury system: “former justice secretary calls for scrapping of defendants’ right to choose jury trial.”

				deep state götterdämmerung? perry de havilland (prague) · north american affairs · slogans & quotations naturally, the press has echoed the deep state. “this is a hostile takeover of the federal government by a private citizen of unlimited means with no restrictions and no transparency,” said kara swisher of a man presently working for the democratically-elected president of our country, following his orders directly, and who at any moment can be (and ultimately almost certainly will be, let’s be honest) fired. “it’s a coup,” said lindsay owens of groundwork (some kind of tedious, commie, dark money think tank), which was echoed throughout the press. “…what’s going on right now really is a genuine crisis,” said jesse singal, “and it should be recognized as such.”
but a crisis for who? i don’t share politics with the deep state, and am not a huge fan of permanent, unelected, unaccountable power in general, so maybe this is hitting me different. in any case, i’ve been wondering: where is this level of “crisis” reporting on the president’s flurry of trans orders? his dismantling of dei? the trade war (already mostly over, by the way) or panama (also basically handled now, but i digress). with the exception of selena gomez, i haven’t seen many tears for deported violent criminals, something we heard a lot about back before the election. no, panic is almost entirely focused on saving federal bureaucrats. why?

who are we? the samizdata people are a bunch of sinister and heavily armed globalist illuminati who seek to infect the entire world with the values of personal liberty and several property. amongst our many crimes is a sense of humour and the intermittent use of british spelling.
we are also a varied group made up of social individualists, classical liberals, whigs, libertarians, extropians, futurists, ‘porcupines’, karl popper fetishists, recovering neo-conservatives, crazed ayn rand worshipers, over-caffeinated virginia postrel devotees, witty frédéric bastiat wannabes, cypherpunks, minarchists, kritarchists and wild-eyed anarcho-capitalists from britain, north america, australia and europe.
