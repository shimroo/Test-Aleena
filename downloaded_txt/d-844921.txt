who we are







                                 the white rock lake foundation focuses on the preservation of white rock lake’s natural health and beauty for the
benefit of people and wildlife.

the lake







                                 white rock lake is considered the jewel of the dallas parks system. from boating, biking, and bird watching to
walking, picnicking, and fishing, there’s something for everyone.


explore white rock lake













                                                watching and helping to nurture the growth of the white rock lake foundation the past 23 years has
been such a pleasure and, at times, a challenge. helping to create public and private funding for many
exciting projects has been incredibly rewarding and will always serve as a great sense of pride and
joy.  many thanks to everyone who has supported the foundation in the past and those who continue
to do so. great things can happen when everyone works towards the common good.

learn more about wrlf









                                                the white rock lake foundation has been a staunch advocate and supporter of white rock lake park for
over 30 years through numerous fundraising efforts, including their annual golf tournament and the
jewel of dallas gala. the foundation’s commitment to signage improvement is evident around the
lake, including the new portal marker at west lawther and williamson roads. my wholehearted
endorsement of this organization continues because they are completely forthcoming and embrace our
lake with open arms.
