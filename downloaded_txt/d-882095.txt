welcome to the first church in chestnut hill!

notice: due to weather, our 10:30 service on sunday, february 16 is cancelled. stay warm and safe and we’ll see you next sunday!
we are a unitarian congregation in the progressive christian tradition where members from many religious backgrounds have found a home.
our service is rich and meaningful, yet simple, and it is deeply rooted in the religious history of new england. our prayerbook is drawn from the anglican service of morning prayer.
our congregation is thoughtful and intellectually curious. rev. mark caggiano’s sermons weave history and current events with lessons from scripture and our discussions touch on all aspects of where we fit in an increasingly complex and diverse world.
we are located at 26 suffolk road, just off hammond street, in chestnut hill.  our door is a quick, 3-minute walk from the chestnut hill t stop and parking is available on the street in front of the church.
for more information on upcoming events, see our calendar and monthly bulletins.
