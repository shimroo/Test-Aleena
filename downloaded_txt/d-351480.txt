wusb sunday street series presents: lou reed & paul simon
by acradio on tue, 02/11/2025 - 9:44pm

sharing some long island roots (as per their high school yearbook photos), lou reed graduated from freeport high school in 1959 where he played guitar and sang in doo-wop groups while paul simon graduated from forest hills high school in 1958 and, with classmate art garfunkel initially recorded as ‘tom and jerry.’
their musical careers saw simon working with garfunkel before pursuing a solo career and reed doing likewise following his departure from the velvet underground. their separate paths would cross in 1980 with reed playing a record executive in ‘one trick pony’ a film simon wrote and starred in.
in the tradition of past sunday street shows honoring artists including warren zevon, mose allison, randy newman, john prine, and jimmy webb, we bring together some of the area's top musicians to share songs from the extensive catalogue of these two singer/songwriters who worked in rather different musical directions..
advance sale tickets at www.sundaystreet.org for $ 25 through march 7th with any remaining tickets at the door for $ 30. (cash only).

exploring digital immortality: eternal you’s hans block & moritz riesewieck on the sounds of film with tom needham
by acradio on thu, 01/30/2025 - 11:07am


on this episode of the sounds of film with tom needham, we delve into the thought-provoking documentary eternal you with directors hans block and moritz riesewieck. known for their acclaimed debut film the cleaners, the duo now tackles the technological revolution of “digital immortality”—a groundbreaking concept blurring the boundaries between life and death.
eternal you examines how artificial intelligence and advanced technologies allow people to interact with digital avatars of deceased loved ones. from a grieving mother reuniting with her late daughter in virtual reality to a man spending months talking to an ai replica of his girlfriend, the film raises urgent questions about grief, ethics, and the commercialization of human emotions.
tom needham engages the filmmakers in a compelling discussion about the psychological, social, and philosophical implications of resurrecting the dead through ai.
the episode also explores how this technology challenges traditional ideas of mortality, accountability, and the very essence of what it means to be human.
join us for an eye-opening conversation about the promises and pitfalls of digital resurrection, the race for afterlife-related technologies by major corporations, and the future of humanity in an increasingly digitized world.
listen to the interview on america’s longest running film, music and ideas radio show, the sounds of film on wusb on thursday at 6 pm.
