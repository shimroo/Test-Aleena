the complete baseline of health
for anyone truly interested in  health and nutrition, jon barron's book, the complete baseline of health is  essential. at  over 1,300 pages, this is a complete graduate-level masterclass in alternative  health. and with over 1900 clickable citations, the complete baseline of  health is the ultimate research and reference tool for anyone  interested in holistic healing. this is not just another ebook translation of a  printed book. it was designed from the ground up as a digital book (there is no  printed edition), with hundreds of live links, and over a dozen embedded videos. 
for  those reluctant to download it, consider: 

at only $9.95, it is the biggest  bargain in alternative health.
for those who think 1,300 pages is  too much to read, remember, this is not a novel. it’s a comprehensive,  completely searchable reference tool on health and nutritionâthat just happens  to be as easy and fun to read as a novel. you can:

methodically work your way through  it from beginning to end if you’re looking for the full graduate level experience.
read it at your own pace if that’s  what you want.
or bring it up as needed and run an  electronic search on whatever particular health issue you want addressed at the  time.

for those who want a printed version,  it’s 1,300 pages. if we sold a printed version, that would be 3 volumes and  would be far, far more expensive than $9.95. (at 20 cents a page for full  color, it would cost over $200 dollars if you printed it yourself, and that’s  without binding.) and you would lose access to over 3,000 pages of linked  information. or to look at it another way, you would loose access to over two-thirds  of the book.
and for those who want a pdf  version, that too is unworkable. 

first of all, amazon charges authors  a 15-cent delivery fee for every mb of file size. since the ebook version is 12  mb, that’s $1.80 amazon takes off the top. they then collect a 30% royalty fee  for selling the book on amazon. that leaves $5.70 for the author.
but pdf files run at least 10 times  larger than ebook files. that means amazon would charge an $18.00 delivery fee.  since the book would then be over $9.95, amazon would take a 35% royaltyâleaving  $4.55 if the pdf were priced at $25.00. but more important, since the book  would be priced higher than $9.98, it would no longer be able to be part of  amazon marketplace, which would severely restrict the ability to sell the book.

      and in addition to cost, unless you’re printing out the pdf file (which as we’ve  already discussed is not a viable option), pdf files are much less readable on  a screen than are ebook files. for more information on the advantages of ebook over  pdf, click  here.
