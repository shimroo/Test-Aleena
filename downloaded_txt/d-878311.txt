environmental resiliency via readiness and environmental protection integration (repi)



environmental resiliency via conservation. the ward burton wildlife foundation is the lead partner to the army national guard for the repi program at ft. barfoot in virginia and ft. indiantown gap in pennsylvania and the marine corps repi program at marine corps base quantico. camp guernsey in wyoming is is currently applying for a repi program, and if approved, wbwf looks forward to being named their primary partner. the military needs bases and training lands for military exercises, training, soldier skill testing, and other operations. training restrictions, costly workarounds, and compromised training realism can result from incompatible development surrounding the installation (external encroachment) and from threatened and endangered species on the installation (internal encroachment). wbwf has the privilege of working alongside like-minded organizations and localities surrounding these installations to provide experience in natural resources, conservation, and land management. with everyone working together in concert, the military missions will be protected from encroachment while the beautiful rural landscapes of virginia and pennsylvania will be conserved for future generations.the wbwf offers several options to landowners to reduce housing development, and landowners are paid for the alternative they choose. the options include conservation easements, deed restrictions, and purchase of the property if the landowner desires.
