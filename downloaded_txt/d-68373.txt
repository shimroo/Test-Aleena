fresh approach
									manufactured by faux effects international inc., the recognized industry leader in faux and decorative finishes, faux effectsâ® products are a complete line of water based products from primers to topcoats engineered to work with ordinary latex paints. these advanced technology products provide consistently slower drying times, allowing maximum workability. and their water based formulation ensures easy cleanup and environmental friendliness.
								








the tools and the techniques!
									our installed base of faux effectsâ® retailers, conveniently located throughout the country, are accomplished faux finishing and decorative painting studios, offering a wealth of real world knowledge and technical support. each studio offers workshops that will show you how to use our glazes, crackles, stains, and stone to produce a wide range of finishes from faux stone, brick, leather and easy marbles, to some of the hottest decorative and fantasy finishes on the market today. no more struggling with unclear directions and uncooperative materials; learn from the pros using professional grade products how to achieve consistently spectacular  results every time with ease, and in far less time. 

								











our mission

at fei, our engineering department uses the best of today's technology to scour the globe to find those lost minerals and natural substances necessary to produce products capable of reproducing the colors and textures that make up the tapestry of our past. 
                            
                            our studios teach not only the best of today's faux and decorative finishing techniques, but also the historical art forms of trompe l'oeil, faux bois, murals, grottesca, and classical ornamentation. the studios we have chosen to represent us are hand picked not only for their talent and accomplishments, but also for their continuing support for our firm commitment to ensuring that these age old art forms are not lost to future generations.
