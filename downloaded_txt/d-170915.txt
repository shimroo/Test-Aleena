what clients say




“marcia hawken is a superb real estate professional. she helped us buy our current condo and sell our old one. contrary to the norm, after sniffing that the market had changed, she suggested a high sales price, urged us not to reduce it and she got it. she has a terrific way with clients, in understanding them and their needs, and in gently guiding the process. she is a delight to work with. smart, professional, and classy. we have recommended her to friends with great success.”
- roger & maureen p.


“well, she is clearly the best there is. made our months of looking very enjoyable. she listens and really understands her client's needs. her knowledge is incredible. through our somewhat long process, we all gained a new friend. i cannot imagine going through this with another realtor®. she listed our old house and sold it within a few short weeks. your company is definitely getting a gem.”
- 
						shelley & larry c.


“in 2017 we decided to make naples our primary residence after living in boston for 38 years. getting it right was critically important. marcia was our broker. she served us exceptionally well. she knows the naples market incredibly well (we chose pelican bay). we never felt any pressure at all. her style is to take all the time we needed to find exactly what we were looking for. she educated us thoroughly on the market. naples can be overwhelming with all its options. once we defined exactly what we wanted, marcia kept an eagle in on the market and kept us fully informed on possibilities. marcia’s communication and follow-up are outstanding. after visiting many homes with marcia it was clear she is well known and highly respected by her peers in the trade. she is a sharp negotiator and we were very satisfied with the price that was accepted. during the closing, marcia was with us every step of the way. marcia introduced us to excellent professional services such as attorneys and insurance agents. finally, marcia has become a trusted friend. couldn’t recommend her more highly.”
- jane & kevin b.
