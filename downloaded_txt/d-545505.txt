about us



the beginnings of lake panorama can be traced to 1931, when building a dam near panora on the middle raccoon river was discussed. more than three decades later, the first by-laws of the lake panorama association were approved. dam construction began in 1969, and lake panorama filled in 1970.plans for the lake panorama development included two golf courses, one on each side of the lake. richard watson was hired to design both. the result was the 18-hole lake panorama national on the  east, and the 9-hole panorama west, both of which opened in 1971.in addition to golf, lake panorama national resort offers onsite lodging, lounge and event space. other amenities include an outdoor swimming pool, sports courts that include pickle ball, basketball and tennis, fitness center and access to private beaches and boating on the beautiful 1,400-acre lake.lake panorama national resort is owned by the lake panorama association, which represents more than 1,750 property owners on the largest private lake in iowa.
