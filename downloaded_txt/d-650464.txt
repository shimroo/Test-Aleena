we welcome our own stephen kallas to the ccrmc





stephen will be speaking to us on "a discussion of the use of tariffs to accomplish both economic and foreign policy goals"

stephen has served in many republican leadership positions such as: platform committee chairman for senate district 8 (sd 8) and the state of texas as well as the rules committee. he currently serves as precinct chair for precinct 102 as well as second vice chair of the collin county republican party. he has also twice been appointed to advisory boards for collin county. in both 2022 and 2024, he had the pleasure of working as the sd 8 member of the republican state convention platform committee.
