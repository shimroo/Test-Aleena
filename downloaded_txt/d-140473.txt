peter e. randall publisher book publishing & marketing

peter e. randall book publisher

peter e. randall publisher was founded in 1970 to provide a high quality book publishing service for municipalities, groups and individuals. we start with your raw manuscript and images and end with a quality book, ready for the marketplace. at per we provide a complete service that includes editing, indexing, design, layout, printing and binding and marketing consultation for both clothbound and paperback books. our titles often win awards.
as we are a subsidy or custom publisher, the author or group bears the cost of publication. this means that the author or group also retains creative control over the project and of the schedule of publication. this is an important detail for many of our authors.
we are a selective publisher, unlike other subsidy houses, and will publish only work that we feel has merit. our focus is primarily non-fiction. our core subjects include: illustrated history, photography, children’s titles, biography and memoir.
per titles receive an excellent marketing foundation. we offer a distribution program for printed volumes, e-books, and print to order titles. we provide full marketing services, with print and online media kits, review contacts, social media networking and stunning author websites, book trailers and collaterals.
we are in this business because we love books and we find authors to be interesting people. if you would like to speak with us about your next project, we invite you to contact us directly by phone, mail or email. we enjoy hearing about new projects!

what our clients say


 
“i am delighted with the appearance of the book. the cover is beautiful! it isn’t very often among reprints that i have seen that the reprint looks better than the original. thank you for all your assistance.”

—maurice m. whitten, author, gunpowder mills of maine

“even though i had written a book, i didn’t consider myself an author. it was just words on paper, until i began working with deidre, and peter e. randall publisher. they understood the importance of my work to me, and helped me turn these words on paper into an award winning book, and me, into an author.”

—mike bonacorsi, certified financial planner, author, retirement readiness: creating your vision, knowing your position, & preparing for your future

“peter randall, my publisher, encouraged me from the beginning to continue with my work. since this was my first attempt to write a book, i needed someone like peter to show me the way. his background that included publishing over 400 works, many of them on local history, made me confident that he could steer me through this process that was so unfamiliar to me. the quality of the book, the layout and design work done by his designer grace and the photograph on the dust jacket all contributed to the appeal of the book.”

—jean foley doyle, author, life in newburyport, 2007
