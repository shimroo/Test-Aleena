derek's oilfield photography

  

welcome to the derek's oilfield 
	photography website! 
		since 2001, i have posted my collection of oil field related photographs 
		since there weren't many websites that dealt 
		with the topic. since 2001, i have posted oil field photos and videos 
	from the united states. i began the website on the geocities platform then 
		switched to independent web hosting in 2003. my photos have been used in 
		text books, trade show backdrops, brochures, and websites. 

    	 

the oil patch has been a part of my 
		life ever since i was a toddler and could crawl to my grandparents 
		window in clarksville city, texas to watch the pumping unit in their 
		yard go up and down. when the well was plugged in 1993, i decided that i 
		needed to start taking photos of the wells before they disappeared 
		forever. now with over thousands of photos of oil fields, i have put a 
		part of my collection on the website. in 2008, i began publishing videos 
		on my youtube channel, link is on the left.
