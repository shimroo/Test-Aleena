	 the east end

from ktultulsa - some downtown merchants are hoping to curb a problem with parking meters. office workers are monopolizing those meters. so, driving customers can't reach downtown businesses. newschannel 8's jerry giordano explains what they're looking to do."that white (car) has been here only a little while, but it will be there the rest of the day."chuck adamson is a merchant in downtown tulsa. he's got plenty of shoes. what he doesn't have is plenty of parking."they plug the meter every hour on the hour," adamson says.
