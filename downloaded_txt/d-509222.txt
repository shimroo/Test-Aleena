				i am often asked what we do with race mules when they are no 
				longer racing. there is a misconception that racing can have 
				negative implications to a mule. i learned this first hand. when 
				i was struggling to locate a mule prospect for the upcoming 
				racing season in 2017, i put my request out on facebook to a 
				group that has some 4000+ members. from the feedback i received, 
				the one that stood out the most was why wreck a good mule by 
				putting it on the race track, enough with this nonsense? i was 
				shocked as i had no idea there was this perception out there. 
				while this article is not to convince anyone of the good that 
				comes to these mules from racing, it is merely to educate those 
				who are not familiar with the mule racing industry and share 
				with you some pretty awesome stories about what happens to these 
				mules when they are no longer racing. to read the full

senorita makes mule racing history by don jacklin: president, 
				american mule racing association

driving, held determinedly, no mistakes....these were some 
				of the words published in the daily race rag to describe 
				senorita in her previous races leading up to the big race in 
				fresno, as she embarked on her quest to finish out a first ever 
				in the history of mule racing, undefeated championship season.
				october 16th, fresno county fair marked the final race 
				of the 2016 racing season and senorita came out on top, 
				capturing the world championship title and the fresno amra gold 
				cup. this marked her second consecutive year to win the world 
				championship title and her 3rd time overall. the challenge 
				requires superior performance throughout the race year against 
				former world champions bjf red ticket and bjf hot ticket. 
in 2013, senorita suffered chip fractures to both of her 
				fetlock joints while in a training session. it nearly marked the 
				end of her racing career. dr. bob schneider, a renowned vet with 
				mckinley peters equine, who specializes in injuries to race 
				horses and had a long history as a vet at portland meadows, 
				evaluated senorita in feb. 2014, as a then 4 year old. it was 
				recommended that she have surgery, followed by several weeks of 
				rehabilitation. she then went back into race training in april 
				2014 and went on to win the championship that same year and has 
				only improved and posted faster times since her this surgery. 
				we are so fortunate to have of the best lameness specialists 
				and surgeons on this side of the rockies, right in our backyard 
				said gayle stegmann, gem state mule company, rathdrum, id. he 
				saved her racing career which now stands in earnings over 
				$70,000.senorita is a 6 year old dapple grey molly bred 
				by roger downy and owned by gayle stegmann and david wood. she 
				is trained by ruby thomas and was rode to her championship race 
				in 2016 by jockey lewis godoy. watch for senorita on the 
				california state racing circuit again in 2017 as she vies for 
				her 4th world championship title. popular mules including red 
				ticket, cowboy way, and cali mcgee will be back for what 
				promises to be another exciting racing season.

amra workers' compensation assistance for new and 
				current owners!!amra will pay to member/owner at 
				the end of the racing year an amount per start that will be 
				determined by the board of diretors. funding will be from the 
				general fund and will be in the approximate amount of $20,000!! 
				this financial incentive is designed to encourage new owners and 
				retain current owners and to help in the reduction of costs 
				incurred as a result of the ever-increasing workers' 
				compensation charges.

				bjf hot ticket, with a culminating and convincing win in the 
				fresno amra gold cup.owned by gayle stegmann and dave 
				wood, ridden by jockey joe crispin and trained by ruby thomas, 
				senorita exploded out of the fresno gate on october 17,
