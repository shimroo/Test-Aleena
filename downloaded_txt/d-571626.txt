still early, snowdrops and outnumbered.





1. i've already been in a taxi and had an mri, and it is still so early that no-one is up at home, so i stop in the park cafe to drink coffee, eat a shortbread and read an edith wharton ghost story.2. nick wonders about the little white flowers outside the back door. they're snowdrops, and they mean spring will soon be here. earlier i saw a planting of giant snowdrops, cyclamen and hellebores at the gates of dunorlan -- all good friends when the rest of the park looks like it has been left outside all winter and then sat on.3. bettany has been asking about outnumbered, which originally broadcast before she was born. we watch an episode (me through my fingers because well observed sitcoms about family life are just a bit too close to home; and her round her phone, occasionally laughing or asking a question).

beyond the barriers, going home and half term.





1. at the station, a friendly face waiting beyond the ticket barriers.2. i walk on to the platform in time to see the destination on the front of the train just arriving: it's on its way to tunbridge wells.3. our lovely child -- just a little bad tempered -- is home for half term.

fruit bowl, plans and resonate.





1. i come down to a fruit bowl full of bright new oranges and apples -- veg box arrived while i was sleeping.2. she asks for a hug so she can lie next to me and tell me all about her plans for own clothes day.3. the folk show is particularly good this evening. most of the tracks seem to speak right to us, and for an hour then show holds our attention so that we listen, rather than seeking other things to do while it plays.

jam, an hour later and gothic.





1. my mother brings us two jars of blackcurrant jam -- perfect timing, because it's hot cross bun season.2. when i look up, it's an hour later and i'm 1,000 words in.3. to marvel at the set before the production starts. this is dracula -- so of course there are ruins and high windows and disconcerting stairways.

clean-up, remembering and winning at chess.





1. brushing mud off my waterproofs -- much easier to clean them dry than wet.2. we've been throwing out some old school books. i find nick sitting on the floor among the recycling reminiscing over photos the teacher has stuck in among the worksheets.3. i win at chess against my son -- but only because he helps me.

questions, chocolate mousse and steady rain.





1. as we make pudding for the evening, she is still asking questions about the sound of music. i've found a playlist and the songs are streaming straight into the kitchen.2. dipping spoons through the bubbly surfaces of our chocolate mousses.3. out there in the dark, the sound of steady rain. this is my best kind of rain: steady, and not happening where i am.

obscure, reminiscing and own suppers.





1. the satisfaction of finding a nice obscure news story that not many other people are talking about.2. the little glint in nick's eye as he talks about the young men behind the names on the honours boards at alec's school.3. from the empty containers in the sink, we can see that the children have done as we asked and got their own suppers out of the freezer.
