	 a teen!
	 
    


sidney is a teenager now! 13 and in high school! it was a rough start though. he heard some things that caused him unnecessary anxiety which led to physical issues. issues that lasted much too long. issues that resulted in him having to spend time in the hospital even. the good news is that we know the cause, we know the result and we can hope to help sidney learn to manage his stress levels so as not to have this happen again. ever.
other than that he's good. he does well in school. he harasses his younger sister by not paying her much attention, and he's a little protective of me which i find too sweet.
he's a good child. i wouldn't trade him. no matter how much he gets on my nerves sometimes. lol  he also make me laugh! oh, how i love him.

sid lost his third tooth this morning. he had been playing with it from last night. he's so grown these days - growing into a handsome young man. and he's still so intelligent. he's a sweetheart to his grandmother, my mother. she loves to have him around cause he's so laid back and just goes with the flow. she calls him "my sid." there is a lot of love there.
