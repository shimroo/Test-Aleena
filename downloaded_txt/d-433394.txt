welcome tothe chapel





our mission is to connect college students to jesus

 

we are a student-led campus ministry of the lutheran church missouri synod (lcms) - but we welcome all no matter what your spiritual background may be! we believe that the bible is entirely true and is the one source of faith. our service, preaching, and musical worship is centered on the words of scripture. we exist to show this by carrying out the gospel and uniting those of all ethnicities, cultures, and socio-economic statuses.“he called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our lord jesus christ”  2 thessalonians 2:14
