why we should be looking at children’s learning from a  long-term perspective





with the final exams looming, we favor more intense practice and repetition of our studies rather than achieving mastery and understanding of a syllabus. it’s an understandable circumstance as the exam results reflect their academic performance.however, do their results truly reflect what they’ve learned accurately? do they achieve true understanding or simply know how to answer the questions and maximize their gain of marks?it is common knowledge among parents that early childhood education is important in social, cognitive and career/academic development. while parents want their children to get a headstart, often it is misplaced to stand out among peers and aim for the best exam results. learning should be more balanced than chasing the best results possible. while indeed important, learning should be a habit or means to a goal of success, ambition and personal development.developing foundational skills is one factor; another factor parents also overlooked is honing those skills. children’s learning is an ongoing process. through this process, we can identify their strengths, flaws, and learning styles. identifying these can help with their journey of not only their textbook learning but also their learning to know more about the world around them.questions have to be raised when we see reforms in our curriculum requiring students to study school syllabi that are deemed overboard. is there too much homework or assignments for children to do today? does the pressure of performing well in exams make them miss the true aim of learning? is learning supposed to be as torturous as we make it out to be?these are some reasons why the demand for homeschooling and private schooling is rising. there is an emphasis on learning based on the child’s suitability and pace of learning. this is where eye level can fulfill this need through tailored and personalized learning programs. they offer subjects of math and english where learning is based on your child’s level. eye level malaysia has over 100 centers currently, catering to thousands of children.find out more about eye level malaysia at myeyelevel.com. book your child’s diagnostic test for free today!

learning has always been distinctive, not uniform






we are approaching the end of the school year, so most students are scrambling to prepare for the final term exams. some students grasp concepts quickly and race ahead, while others process new information at their own pace. each student’s journey is distinct, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to learning. this is something that should be celebrated, not discouraged. in today's fast-paced world, the pressure to perform uniformly can cause the students to feel overwhelmed or even left behind. however, it’s essential to remember that learning doesn’t have a finish line. it's a continuous process, where every child will progress at their own rate, mastering skills and subjects as they go along. what matters most is the support and guidance they receive on this journey.some students quickly breeze through their lessons, while others take their time, ensuring they understand each concept fully before moving forward. and that’s completely okay. the most important thing is that learning continues at a steady pace and in an environment that supports the child's unique needs. the school holidays are a great opportunity for children to have a study reset, to be a bit more lax with their studies and perhaps explore new passions. learning during holidays should improve their transition into a new school year.that’s exactly what eye level malaysia offers. we recognize that no two students are the same, and that’s why we tailor our programs to suit each child’s learning pace and ability. whether it’s mastering english or math, eye level’s structured, step-by-step approach allows students to build confidence in their skills, ensuring they fully understand each concept before moving forward. this personalized learning system encourages students to become self-directed learners, helping them thrive academically.to make things even better, eye level offers an exciting year-end promo! for just rm40, your child can enjoy 2 trial classes and discover the eye level difference firsthand. plus, you'll receive rm50 off the registration fee when you sign up. it's the perfect opportunity to give your child a head start in the new year, setting them on the right track to success.learning truly is distinctive and different with every child. with the right guidance, every child has the potential to achieve great things. take advantage of eye level’s discovery class promo today and help your child unlock their full potential! this post was brought to you by eye level malaysia.
