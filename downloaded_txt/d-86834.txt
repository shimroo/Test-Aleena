welcome to cypress lakes!
 
cypress lakes makes the leap from good to a great because we’ve spent the last ten years transforming ourselves into a championship style course. 18 holes, par 72, and 7240 yards of hybrid 419 bermuda grass, stand ready to test your skills. our newly renovated champion bermuda grass greens lay down like smooth carpet. precision growth and management techniques ensure the best possible chance of making par.
an extremely fair course to play, you can take it on as aggressively as you desire. and because it has no blind spots to the greens, you won’t be forced into extremely challenging shots unless you want them. whether you play it assertively or safely, cypress lakes uniquely tests every caliber player at their own level.
