our mission



we are an apostolic community of women, baptized in christ and vowed to continue the mission of god’s church.  in the spirit of st. vincent de paul and st. elizabeth seton, the congregation conceives its purpose to be an active ministry on behalf of the kingdom. 
our service is informed by gospel values, responsive to the needs of a changing world, guided by the prudent use of available resources,  respectful of human dignity,  protective of human rights,  devoted especially to the poor and oppressed,  supported by the common life, animated by prayer, rooted in faith, and performed in humility, simplicity, and charity.                                                                                         












together forward

the history of the sisters of charity of seton hill reflects a spirit of courage founded upon a strong faith and trust in god’s providence. impelled by that spirit, our congregation looks to the future with hope and renewed dedication to the mission of christ and the church.
in our pursuit of change, we recall the words of saint ann elizabeth seton: “all journeys cause us to leave something behind as we move toward something new.” we embrace the motto of the seton coat of arms: hazard yet forward. elizabeth always encouraged her sisters to remain faithful and push on, even in the face of uncertainty.
