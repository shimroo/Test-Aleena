pathology & laboratory medicine










            we embody the vision of founding chair dr. w.a.d. anderson:  “pathology should form the basis of every physician’s thinking about the patient.” our mission is to deliver excellence in patient care, train the next generation of pathologists, and promote basic and translational research.  our program has a culture of diversity, equity, inclusion, innovation, and continuous improvement.
