amazing museums 





from the towering giant sequoias in northern california to the perfect white beaches of southern california, this sunny state is probably my favorite in the united states. the relaxed atmosphere, the green palm trees along the roads, and the spirit of the “american dream” are in the air. this state of road trips, beautiful and tanned people and incredible scenery and many beautiful museums.

for falling in love with california:


for the beauty of nature. surprisingly, california is not a young state at all. both the coastline, with its picturesque cliffs, and its snow-capped mountains have been formed over thousands of years by plate tectonic movements that still cause strong earthquakes. in the 19th century, conservationists succeeded in turning the state’s natural beauties into national parks, rather than losing them to industrial development and infrastructure building.


for diversity. from the gold rush to the boom of internet companies, california has always remained at the center of things. to this day, hollywood is the center of the world’s film and television industry, sustained by the culturally vibrant life of the state’s entire population. here all the time some revolutionary ideas appear or the most popular brands are born. and their creators aren’t just office “plankton” but free-thinking surfers, artists, and dreamers.




to atmosphere. any road trip you make in california will surprise you every mile. even away from the cities, you’ll find unique experiences – charming little towns, stunning national parks, vineyards stretching for miles, or gorgeous bays with azure ocean. there is no place not worth seeing. and there’s a distinctly californian, relaxed, drive-thru vibe everywhere.


here’s to local cuisine. since california is the producer of most fresh food in the united states, the food is as fresh and delicious as possible. moreover, here was born the cult of healthy eating and organic cuisine, so at every step you will find cafes with kombucha and organic muesli with chia seeds. in fact, in america, which is rightly considered the land of steaks, burgers, and fries, this choice of healthy food is very valuable.


it seems to me that there is something different about california that appeals to everyone. but every self-respecting traveler should visit this magical state. just be careful – so many people stay here to live!
