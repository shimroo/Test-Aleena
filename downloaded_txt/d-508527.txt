how to travel as a minor

september 5, 2020							                            comments off on how to travel as a minor 

generally, there is nothing wrong about allowing your child to travel alone. most airlines allow minors to travel unaccompanied. however, there are certain precautions that you must take when planning to send your child on a flight unaccompanied. the following are important tips for minor travelers that you should observe. 
know the age guidelines for unaccompanied minors  
do not just assume that all minors can travel alone. airlines consider children between 5 and 14 years old to be minors who can travel alone. if your kid is within that age bracket, they must be booked into the ‘’unaccompanied minors’’ service to travel alone. however, it is optional for minors aged 15 to 17 years old. 
minors aged 5 to 7 years old can fly to single destinations alone but, not connecting flights. those aged 8 years old and above can change flights but, with the help of flight attendants. 
any minor under the age of 17 years old who is flying abroad unaccompanied may be asked to provide a signed letter of consent from a parent or guardian. 
inform the airline in advance 
do not wait until the time of boarding to tell the airline that you have a minor traveling unaccompanied. instead, call them well ahead of time to know your options, related charges, and any other requirements. 
consider buying non-stop tickets 
even if your child is old enough to hop onto connecting flights, you should buy non-stop tickets to avoid any confusion. it will also ensure a quick journey. 
familiarize the minor with the itinerary 
you should also make sure that the minor knows the itinerary including the routes and things to do at each step of the way. that will enable them to keep to the plan, thereby avoiding any deviations.
traveling as a minor might seem like a scary experience at first but, it is always a great way for the younger ones to explore the world and test their instincts. instead of wondering about their safety, prepare a good travel plan and let them go experience the unique charms of new environments.

how traveling affects your personality

december 31, 2019							                            comments off on how traveling affects your personality 


traveling has been lauded as one of the best ways to improve our personality. it broadens our perspectives, exposes us to new experiences and refreshes our minds from the daily routines. read on to find out more.
neuroticism
this refers to emotional instability. in life, we must cope with changes- whether subtle or intense regularly. individuals who travel often are used to random changes and unfamiliar situations. therefore, such people are adept at adjusting to these dilemmas, compared to those who don’t travel. traveling thus helps to solve issues of neuroticism.
it makes you more agreeable
in addition to adding a fresher perspective to how you perceive things, traveling improves your confidence and social skills. this happens when you interact with new people from different backgrounds in terms of culture and language. it also opens your eyes to the dramatic differences between the people you meet and your own culture. these experiences help you to become more compassionate, agreeable and friendly as time goes on.
conscientiousness 
this helps you to follow rules, complete tasks and remain cautious throughout. while traveling, conscientiousness is an attribute that you must possess to avoid bad travel experience. it helps you to avoid being driven crazy by loose travel plans or overexerting yourself due to overloaded to-do plans.
makes you open to experiences
while traveling, it’s impossible to avoid meeting new people. these people bring with them new experiences as your interaction continues. as you get immersed in these new encounters, your personality develops openness trait.
you look at things from a different perspective 
when you travel, you meet and interact with new people. this opens your mind to see the world from a different perspective. you learn that different people have different ways of doing things. and, this broadens your perspective. 
travelling, therefore, is a great tool for re-shaping your personality by exposing you to new challenges and experiences.

how to travel with your dog on an airplane

december 31, 2019							                            comments off on how to travel with your dog on an airplane 


if you plan to travel with your dog on a plane, the process can be costly and tasking. this article will help you to gauge the options available.
pets in the cabin
you can take your dog on the plane, under the seat in front of you. in some major airlines like southwest and jetblue, this is your only option as they don’t allow pets in the cargo hold at all. some airlines have restrictions for first and business class seats on certain types of planes. you need to schedule your pets to travel with the airline 14 days in advance. this is because there are only a particular number of pets allowed per plane. the cost on most airlines varies between a hundred dollars to two hundred dollars to carry your dog in a plane. 
the main problem with this arrangement is that the dog may not be small enough to fit under the seat.
service animals
in some instances, service animals help blind people to move easily. these animals walk the blind to their seats conveniently by avoiding them bumping into other passengers. service animals are always welcome in planes as they perform an important task on the plane.
emotional support animals
since the cost of taking a dog on the plane is high, some people register their pets as emotional support animals to avoid charges. this has been made easy by the emergence of online companies that sell you an esa letter easily. normally, you need a letter from a mental health professional indicating that the animal performs a necessary function for its owner.
species restriction for in-cabin animals
since january 2018, united have been restricting emotional support animals to dogs above four months of age. this restriction now applies to united, delta, alaska, and spirit. these airlines will also require three forms. these are the vet certificate, a letter from a mental health professional, and a liability waiver from the pet’s owner, and a 48 hours’ notice before the presentation of the esa letter.
dog in the cargo hold
 some planes have pressurized cargo holds that ensures the survival of pets. this requires early booking, as there are limited spaces. different airlines will charge differently.
it is important to read through the above options to avoid bad outcomes that may spoil your travel experience.
