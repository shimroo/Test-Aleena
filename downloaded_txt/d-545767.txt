approach













caring culture
building a culture of caring is our first priority. we all learn better when we feel cared for and know we are wanted in the community. we believe teacher-student relationships are everything.

safe climate
we take safety very seriously. from teaching prevention to preparing for emergencies, our students are cared for and protected.

inspirational instruction
it is our great privilege to immerse our students in creative inquiry every day. we think learning new things and making discoveries is awesome and we pass that feeling on to our students.



learn more


















equipped for the future
when students leave us they will be more curious than when they arrived and more prepared for the next phase of their life. whether that is higher education, career training or the job of their dreams. we prepare our students so their choices are limitless.
