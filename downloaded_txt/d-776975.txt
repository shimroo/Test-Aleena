fine food - craft brews - wine - cocktails













the taverncraving a place they could enjoy a craft-brewed beer, nice glass of wine, organic food and live music year-round, jeff and susan gecas opened the gunflint tavern on may 22, 1998 in the old grand marais state bank building. it continues to thrive on these same principals today. cheers to great food & great drinks!













the raventhe raven is a quaint timber-framed pub across the hall from the main bar and dining room. the raven serves fine spirits and specialty drinks in an olde world atmosphere that will make you feel comfortable and content. enjoy sports on the big screen tv or just come on down for some food and drinks!
