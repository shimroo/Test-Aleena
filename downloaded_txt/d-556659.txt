welcome to asne tidewater section!


our historythe american society of naval engineers (asne) was founded in 1888 to foster research and development in the new technology of steam propulsion and in new materials as applied to naval warships. asne has since expanded its breadth of interest to all engineering matters as related to naval ship design, maintenance, and operation. current membership is comprised of over 5,000 engineers engaged in shipboard hull, mechanical, and electrical systems; combat systems; hydrodynamics; naval architecture; nuclear and conventional propulsion; aircraft systems; and a potpourri of traditional engineering disciplines as applied to naval ships.
