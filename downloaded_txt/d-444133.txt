clients feedback  






















“as a leader in the united states navy and as a colleague of michael eric owens, i highly recommend s.o.u.l. to anyone who wants to be a leader. owens has codified some of the most authentic leadership principles in this book. the strategies employed in school of unselfish leadership are practical, doable, and tested.  by engaging in this seminal work, you can become the leader you always wanted to be.” –







aaron vickers,
 petty officer 1st class, retired


“s.o.u.l. is a much read for all leaders.  michael eric owens has used his years of military and private sector experiences to produce a new philosophy of leadership. as a veteran, i have not read a book more thorough on this topic.  school of unselfish leadership will change how you lead and interact regardless of the industry you work in.”







 bernard robinso
 chief petty officer, retired


“what is leadership? michael eric owens answers this critical question in s.o.u.l. every seasoned and emerging leader can learn from this book. this is a groundbreaking dive into all aspects of leadership, mentoring, diversity, and so much more. school of unselfish leadership is the best leadership book i have every read.”







 bethella sam phillips
 chief petty officer, retired


“this should be required reading for every leader and leadership course. owens provides operational steps for becoming a dynamic and unselfish leader.  s.o.u.l. reads as a user’s manual for what leadership is and what it is not. it’s beyond simply a guidebook for leaders; school of unselfish leadership provides life-changing concepts that will transform the way you approach your role as a leader.”
