mystery of the ring – madison version
a resident of lake ronkonkoma, ny contacted president marty alpert last fall. he found a madison ring on the beach. it’s a boy’s ring, class of 1956, initials inside seem to be rmk but could be rmh. this very nice man sent this to us and we are holding on to it until claimed. it’s in our hands right now but in the spring, we will place it in the alumni memorabilia room at madison, on display. if you think this is your ring or that of someone you know, please contact marty at admin@jamesmadisonalumni.org.
