the dark star website explores 
the existence of an additional, massive planet in our solar system.  it is 
usually referred to as planet x.  recently, astronomers and 
astrophysicists have begun to name this putative object 'planet nine'.   
other ideas about planet x focus 
upon references made in various mythical 
writings to rogue gods and fabled worlds.  
this website explores 
the science behind planet x. however, it is also open to other ideas, in 
particular the ancient celestial phenomenon known as nibiru.   
it follows the truth, whichever direction it takes.



 
the dark star theory considers 
whether a 
binary failed star may be orbiting our sun at a great distance.  this binary 
object is a sub-brown dwarf, probably several jupiter-masses in size.  it 
occupies the mysterious realm between planet and brown dwarf star.  this 
dark star may be 
the cause of many effects on our 
solar system.  it can explain a wealth of anomalies in the outer solar system 
- 
particularly in the distant kuiper belt.  the scientific evidence is solid 
enough, which has been explored in detail in the popular 2005 book 

'the 
dark star' and updated in 2019 in the entirely new 
book 
'darker stars'. 

planet x may be the 
key player in cosmic catastrophism, particularly during the early life of the 
solar system.  even now, it may play an unseen, but vital role, in our 
solar system's dynamics.  much of what you have read on social media about 
a brown dwarf companion started life on this website.



 
the dark star may also play an important part in our 
own history.  because this object emits heat, and perhaps a small amount of dim light,  
it is capable of warming and nurturing its own planetary system.  it 
follows that the dark star's planetary system would be capable of supporting 
complex life right on our cosmic doorstep.  potentially, this sub-brown dwarf is part of a much bigger picture 
- one involving a whole new cosmic paradigm regarding our own origins.
