who is god? 



     he has revealed himself in his word as father, son, and holy spirit; three persons, one, true god. he is a spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable, in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth. (matt. 2819, 1 john 5:7, john 4:24, psalm 90:2, psalm 147:5, rev. 19:6, isaiah 57:15, deut. 32:4, psalm 100:5, exodus 34:6) 








what is christian worship?
 



to declare god’s law, god’s salvation through his son, jesus christ, teach the whole counsel of god, provide corporate worship and prayer to god, equip the saints for the work of the ministry, and disciple the nations, transforming the culture to his obedience. (acts 1:1-8, rom. 10:14-17, rom. 3:31, matt. 28:19, mk. 16:5, matt. 21:13, eph. 4:11-16) 








what is the church? 



     the church is the body of christ, the total number of those who believe in christ. the fellowship of believers is the community who share in christ and all his treasures and gifts for the service and enrichment of others. (1 cor. 1:9, 2 cor. 8:1-5, eph. 2:19-22, col. 1:24, 1 cor. 12:12-31) 












 









 









 









 





























living the great commission 



go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit,  teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you; and lo, i am with you always, even to the end of the age. 














at mercy seat christian church, we are dedicated to following the great commission 



scripture teaches we should maintain and extend god’s church by telling others about jesus christ and by personal service, prayer, and tithes.the purpose of the church is to declare god’s law, to declare god’s salvation through his son, jesus christ, to teach god’s whole counsel as revealed in scripture, to provide a place of corporate worship to god, to provide a place of corporate prayer to god, to equip the saints for the work of the ministry, and to disciple the nations, thus transforming the culture to his obedience.scripture also teaches that we have a holy obligation to act on behalf of the preborn babies threatened by abortion because they are our neighbors and jesus taught, “love your neighbor as yourself.” (luke 10:27-37)
