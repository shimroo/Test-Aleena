          how can service providers gain access to new revenue streams? look no further than rogers.

the canadian csp offers a great example of how leveling up service operations could lead to innovation and new revenue streams for telcos.

rogers had a clear goal when approaching ericsson: wanting to evolve its service orchestration and assurance capabilities in order to offer network slicing and all the associated services to its customers.

with ericsson, they started out with deploying a modern service orchestration platform, addressing not only business needs, but also legacy system challenges.

after deployment, the operator is now able to operationalize and commercialize network slicing on scale thanks ericsson dynamic network slicing in a matter of minutes with guaranteed slas.

⭐ this one-two punch upgrade using ericsson solutions facilitates swift network slicing operationalization, automating service life-cycles for enhanced efficiency - a great choice for csps looking for extra monetization opportunities in their 5g networks.

you can learn about the challenges and learnings of their journey in the case study on the link below.

do you think more csps should follow suit and double down on upgrading their oss and bss?

          dapps: real-time o-ran ric apps

◼ rapps, xapps and dapps
- rapps: applications that run on the non-real-time ric, responsible for long-term control actions and decision-making that require timescales greater than one second.
- xapps: applications operating on the near-real-time ric, which handle control loops ranging from 10 milliseconds to a few seconds. they are capable of closed-loop control for use cases like mobility management and network slicing.

- dapps: distributed applications running directly on ran elements, such as cus and dus. they handle real-time control loops below 10 milliseconds, focusing on radio management, resource scheduling, beamforming, and modulation functionalities. dapps provide faster control for these functions by operating closer to the data source, ensuring fine-grained management and reducing overhead.

◼ need for dapps
while rapps and xapps deliver meaningful improvements, their architecture falls short in providing efficient control at sub-10 millisecond scales due to inherent latency in data collection and decision implementation. dapps address this gap by embedding control logic directly into the ran nodes. they achieve reduced latency, programmability at the edge.

◼ interaction with the user plane: 
access to low-level user data, such as iq samples, allows dapps to manage interference, beam directionality, and modulation while maintaining privacy and security.

◼ challenges and architectural evolution
the concept of dapps, though promising, presents challenges related to resources, orchestration, and standardization:

- resource management: with multiple dapps sharing the same physical resources at dus/cus, intelligent resource allocation is crucial to avoid conflicts.
- standardized interfaces: the interfaces connecting dapps to the cus/dus need to be defined and standardized to facilitate seamless data collection and control.
- orchestration: an orchestration framework is essential to determine which tasks are suitable for xapps versus dapps and to mitigate conflicts between them.

◼ proposed architecture for dapps

- dapps as softwarized containers
- southbound and northbound interfaces
- conflict mitigation
- intent-based orchestration

◼ real-world applications
- beam management: dapps can implement ai-driven beam selection logic to enhance spectrum utilization and reduce interference.
- ultra-low latency applications: by managing scheduling and slicing at sub-10 millisecond timescales, dapps can support ultra-reliable low-latency communication (urllc).

institute for the wireless internet of things (wiot), which has been a leader in research on real-time ric and dapps, published a paper on the topic and made a more detailed proposal at the last ric forum. collaboration between industry and research is crucial to realizing this vision, addressing challenges in standardization, resource management, and orchestration.

          pakistan’s digital future: hyperscalers, 2africa, and twa's role in connecting millions
today, much of our connectivity comes from undersea cables that stretch thousands of miles across the ocean floor, traditionally operated by telecom companies. however, this is rapidly changing. hyperscalers—major tech companies like google, meta, microsoft, and amazon—are investing in their own undersea cables to meet growing data needs. this trend is impacting pakistan with the arrival of the 2africa cable system, a vast undersea network aimed at transforming connectivity across asia, europe, and africa.
in pakistan, the 2africa cable project includes a karachi branch, where transworld associates (twa), a leading name in pakistan’s telecom industry, is the key landing partner. twa has teamed up with meta and china mobile international (cmi) to bring this powerful connectivity infrastructure to pakistan, aiming to strengthen the nation’s digital backbone and improve internet quality for people and businesses alike.
a new era: open and carrier-neutral connectivity
twa’s collaboration with meta and cmi is about more than just faster internet speeds; it’s an entirely new digital infrastructure for pakistan. twa is setting up a carrier-neutral data center and an open-access cable landing station specifically for the 2africa cable. this means other telecom companies in pakistan can also access the cable’s high-speed connectivity while staying within the ambit of existing regulations regime. it gives meta and other companies direct, unrestricted access to the data, ensuring faster, more reliable internet services across the country.
this open model is a win-win: pakistani telecom providers can improve customer service and expand offerings nationwide, while the overall quality of connectivity improves. as more companies join this model, costs may decrease, making quality internet access more affordable for everyone.
better connections, bigger impact
the 2africa cable and twa’s open-access facilities mark a critical shift in pakistan’s connectivity landscape. with twa’s forward-thinking approach, pakistan now has access to a world-class level of internet infrastructure that is both open and scalable. this isn’t only about data; it’s about creating opportunities for economic growth, connecting families and businesses, and fostering a digital future that aligns with global standards.
the road ahead: a stronger, more connected pakistan
looking forward, pakistan’s digital potential is promising. as hyperscalers continue expanding undersea networks, twa’s innovative, open-access approach ensures pakistan can take full advantage. this groundwork paves the way for the nation to thrive in the global digital age, empowering everyone—from tech leaders to everyday citizens—to stay connected to what matters most.

          telecom vendor selection isn't the same as other procurement.

so if your vendor selection process tries to:
- only factor in price,
- rely on outdated information,
- overlook location-specific coverage...

...expect it to create sub-optimal connectivity at best, business disruption at worst.

this one-size-fits-all approach might work in centralized procurement but in telecom - it falls short.

which is why i'm equal parts surprised & not surprised it's so common.

surprised because it's clearly the wrong approach.

but also not surprised because it's easy to see how we got here...

telecom used to be very centralized.

and, at that time, this made perfect sense.

the carriers were limited.
the options were standardized.
most services didn't leave the bounds of the office.

these stakeholders needed to be able to control costs. the process supported that.

it was only when remote work did end-users start having sway over connectivity decisions.

in response, telecom procurement corrected course.

but it over-corrected.

and now the correction needs correcting.

i'm not saying throw out procurement best practices.

but i am saying that it should enable productivity as quickly & efficiently as possible.

eliminate the guesswork.
keep the oversight.

the roles of ai/genai in intent-based and intent-driven network automation highlight a progression in technology application—from structured, rule-based operations to dynamic, learning-driven processes.

◼ conventional ai in intent-based network automation
in intent-based network automation, ai's role is primarily focused on translating high-level business intents into specific, actionable network configurations. the use of ai in this context is generally more constrained and structured, revolving around specific algorithms and models designed for predictable and predefined tasks.

- policy translation: ai algorithms interpret business intents (expressed in natural language or structured formats) and convert them into technical configurations that can be directly applied to network devices.
- configuration validation: before deploying changes to the network, ai systems can simulate and validate configurations to ensure they will perform as expected without disrupting existing services.

◼ genai in intent-driven network automation
intent-driven network automation represents a more advanced application of ai, specifically leveraging capabilities of genai, which include adaptive learning and the ability to generate outputs based on a wide array of input data. genai in this scenario facilitates a highly adaptive, responsive, and proactive network management system.

- translating business objectives: llms can interpret the natural language to understand business goals and translate them into technical network configurations. this makes it easier for non-technical stakeholders to interact with network systems.
- dynamic intent interpretation: genai systems process and interpret a variety of data in real time, including network performance data, user behavior, and external market conditions. they dynamically refine and adapt network intents based on this data.
- predictive analytics and adaptive configuration: utilizing advanced machine learning models, genai predicts future network states and automatically adjusts configurations to optimize performance, prevent failures, and meet changing demands.
- cross-domain orchestration: genai coordinates actions across various segments of the network and business operations, managing dependencies and synchronizing activities to improve overall outcomes. this is especially crucial in complex environments like multi-service networks or integrated it and telecom infrastructures.
- continuous learning and optimization: unlike traditional ai, genai continually learns from ongoing operations and adapts its models without explicit reprogramming. this capability enables the network to improve its operations over time, based on actual performance and outcomes.
