“i am a couples counselor … i am utterly amazed at the accuracy of what michelle has written. i would like to make these books available in my office for clients.” dr. lacey london on
“i have been reading your book all week and have found it to be completely insightful and clarifying. i have been married for 7 yearsand have a 3 year old at home. i have not engaged in an affair but over but over the last few months have definitely considered looking for it…thank you for sharing your wisdom. i feel clearer now than i have for a long time. i know my whole family is going to benefit from this information.” katie little
“…chapter [2], alone, is worth the us cover price…what is here is impressive…” – donna dillman, grip magazine
“i never write testimonials, and seldom review books. yours however, is exceptional…your book provided me with a compass and powerful insights that guided me through the most confusing and difficult time of my life. this kind of insight simply was not available anywhere else. my wife was able to tell me the truth last night while we had a good heart-to-heart conversation. it appears that we have a good chance of our separation concluding with my wife moving back home and us working on our marriage together. it was a treacherous journey, one that i would have most surely bungled without your book. – best regards, mike lucas
“i just happened across your website today and what i’ve found is truly enlightening. as a psychologist i did have occasion to study marriage and marriage counseling to some degree…clearly there is a significant absence of information such as yours being disseminated to graduating psychologists in training. having been down the marital breakup path, i can also clearly attest to the accuracy of your conclusions…you have provided me with a wealth of insight that will serve me well in my professional work but more importantly, at least for me, you have helped me to understand some of the primary if not the primary factor in the eventual failure of my own marriage…   read more

female stages of infidelity

excerpt from women’s infidelity: living in limbo
stage two —> women at stage 2 experience reawakened desire stimulated by an encounter outside the marital relationship. whether these encounters with a “new” man involves sex or remain platonic, women will typically give a tremendous amount of emotional significance to these encounters. many women in this stage haven’t felt any sexual desire for a long time. many experience tremendous guilt and regret, regardless of whether their new relationships are sexual, merely emotional, or both. most begin to experience what could be termed an identity crisis—even those who try to put the experience behind them. constant reminders are everywhere. they feel guilt when the topic of infidelity arises, whether in the media, in conversations with family and friends, or at home with their husbands. women in this stage can no longer express their prior disdain for infidelity without feeling like a hypocrite. they feel as though they have lost a part of themselves. reflecting society’s belief that women are either “good” or “bad,” women will question their “good girl” status and feel that they might not be deserving of their husbands. many will try to overcome feelings of guilt by becoming more attentive toward and appreciative of their husbands. however, over time many women will move from appreciation to justification. in order to justify their continued desire for other men, women will begin to attribute these desires to needs that are not being met in their marriage, or to their husband’s past behavior. many women will become negative and sarcastic when speaking of their husbands and their marriages and it is not uncommon for an extramarital affair to follow. 

stage three —> women at stage 3 are involved in affairs, ending affairs, or contemplating divorce. women who are having affairs experience feelings unlike anything they have experienced before. they feel “alive” again and many believe they have found their soul mates. these women are experiencing feelings associated with a chemically altered state, or what is typically referred to as being in love. these women are also typically in tremendous pain, the pain of choosing between their husbands and their new love interests. they typically believe that what they are doing is wrong and unfair to their husbands, but yet are unable to end their affairs. many often try several times. prior to meeting with their lovers, they will vow that it will be the last time, but they are unable to stick with their decisions.
unable to end their extramarital relationships, women at stage 3 conclude that their lovers are soul mates because they are unaware that they have become addicted to the high caused by chemicals released during the initial stages of a relationship. many live in a state of limbo for years. “should i stay married or should i get a divorce?” this is the question continuously on the minds of women at stage 3 – it is also common for women at this stage to attempt to initiate a separation. in most cases, husbands of women at stage 3, will launch futile attempts to make their wives happy by being more attentive, spending more time at home and helping out around the house. regardless of women’s past and present complaints, the last thing women at stage 3 want, is to spend more time with their husbands. 
the reason many women will give for their desire to separate is a “search for self.” they convince their husbands that they might be able to save their marriage if they can just have time to themselves. they tell their husbands that time apart is the only hope of improving their current situation. women at this stage want to free themselves of the restrictions of marriage and spend more time with their lovers. most think that eventually their confusion will disappear. they think they will eventually know with certainty whether they want to stay married or get divorced and be with their lovers. separation allows women at this stage, to enjoy the high they experience with their lovers without giving up the security of their marriages. husbands of stage 3 women are often unaware that their wives are having affairs. their lack of suspicion is typically due to their wife’s disinterest in sex and in their belief that their wife is a “good girl.”
women at stage 3 may also be experiencing the ending of an extramarital affair, and the ending may not have been their decision. they may have been involved with single men who either lost interest because … read all four stages
