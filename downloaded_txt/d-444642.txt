                                      blue book 

mr. fromm,
    









                                      today i was repairing a k7000 that
                                      had me stumped, as usual i found
                                      the answer in my big blue book. i
                                      can't tell you how many times i
                                      reference your book when repairing
                                      monitors. it has never let me down
                                      yet. i have hundreds of dollars
                                      invested in test equipment, but
                                      the most valuable tool is your big
                                      blue book.
  i'm
                                      off to finish my repair just
                                      thought i would let you know how
                                      much i appreciate your technical
                                      ability.
thanks
                                      again,

                                      hello my name is charlie
                                      fleck.  i attended your
                                      school in ottawa,  il. 
                                      employed by m and m vending and
                                      amusement of macomb, 
                                      il.  thought i'd drop you a
                                      line to let you know your class
                                      helped me tremendously.  m
                                      and m is a very big amusement
                                      operation where there are plenty
                                      of monitors to be fixed
                                      daily.  before i attended
                                      your class we had 82 broken
                                      monitors sitting around.  on
                                      average we have 2 to 3 go down a
                                      week.  i couldn't imagine
                                      learning how to fix them in 1
                                      weeks time i was assured i would
                                      from my boss.  you gave me
                                      the basics and i read your book
                                      over and over till it almost
                                      turned black from all the crud on
                                      my fingers from those monitors but
                                      i thank you for the enjoyment i
                                      get out of fixing them and i'm
                                      sure my boss would thank you for
                                      all the money he's saving $80 to
                                      $100 a monitor with
                                      shipping.  did convince my
                                      boss mike paisley to buy cr7000
                                      sencore rejuvenator which fixed
                                      appoximately 20 of them but i
                                      couldn't live without it just
                                      using it to test them tells me in
                                      1 minute if the color problem is
                                      in the board or the tube. 
                                      will quickly let you know what
                                      i've fixed since the 4 mos. that i
                                      attended your school.  90
                                      plus monitors around 12 of them
                                      being 25" to 27",  9 
                                      megatouchs new models and
                                      old,  and can't forget dad's
                                      1981 25" zenith tv.  just
                                      knowing how to read the schematics
                                      has helped me fix numerous old
                                      arcade games that everyone seems
                                      to want instead of new.
thanks
                                      again thought you'd enjoy the
                                      praise of your work!

randy,
i attended
                                      your arcade school during
                                      september at  brady
                                      distributing. i flew in from tampa
                                      that week to take your course and
                                      it was well worth it. i have moved
                                      from a miserable, warehouse
                                      manager position to become head
                                      technician for all brands vending.
this was my
                                      first week on the job and i am
                                      loving every minute of it. i have
                                      already repaired four cougar dart
                                      machines, three jukeboxes, and a
                                      golden tee golf game. i never knew
                                      work could be this much fun!
my
                                      assistant will be attending your
                                      orlando class in december. i have
                                      already told him what to expect
                                      from you as a teacher. he is
                                      looking froward to the
                                      experience. 
thank you,

hi randy:
i was really impressed
                                        with your school.
after twenty years
                                        fixing avionics in the navy and
                                        then three years with dale 
williams at disney,
                                        the two days with you were the
                                        most educational.  if the 
military would have
                                        been training techs to actually
                                        fix things (like you do) 
instead of some kind
                                        of ersatz engineers, my life and
                                        career would have most 
certainly been more
                                        enjoyable.
kudos, keep cranking
                                        out good techs.

i now have $300.00

                                        supplies instead of $300.00
                                        worth of throw away power
                                        supplies.

i really enjoyed this

                                        than i did in six months of
                                        technical school.
