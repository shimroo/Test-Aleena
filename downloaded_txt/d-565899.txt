one of the most memorable tours visiting rome, italy was a tour to the colosseum. this 3 –tiered monumental amphitheatre built more than 2000 years ago is the most recognizable buildings of ancient rome.this tour included the neighboring landmarks as emperor’s constantine‘s arch, and palatine hill, and forum -– political, religious and commercial centers of ancient city.we enjoyed the tour and recommend to have it on a short bucket list visiting rome, italy.a.g. june 2016

we were very pleased with our vatican tour. we visited vatican museums, sistine chapel & st. peter's basilica. our guide franchesca was very knowledgeable and insightful. his is the best way to visit the vatican, and skip lines.

walking tour of rome.took a walking tour of rome in summer. the tour is free, and you give tip at the end of the tour. our guide fabio was great, we saw trevi fountain, pantheon, spanish stairs, piazza navona with its famous and wonderful bernini fountain. we learned a lot about the history.
