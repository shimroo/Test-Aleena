what our students are saying about us




diana is the best, i walked in being brand new to this industry, knowing very little. i walked out after day 4 so knowledgeable and ready to offically start my insurance career. she takes what is complicated material to the average individual and makes it relatable and easy to understand by applying it to real world situations using her entertaining stories. i was not looking forward to sitting in a classroom for 10 hours a day, but at the end i wanted to know more! i cant wait to pursue other licenses and take more courses offered by diana!


lindsey m.






this was my first time attending the school. fantastic experience all around! i really enjoyed the way ed navigated the materials. his thorough instruction helped me retain majority of the key concepts i would need to pass the state exam. with the schools help, in addition to personal studies, i passed the state exam on the first attempt. i will definitely return to this school for my 2-20 license studies.


james g.






diana is such an amazing instructor. not only is she incredibly knowledgeable. she does know how to make difficult material seem bearable and super fun! i recommend her 100%
