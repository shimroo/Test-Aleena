from concept to complete











giclées
giclée (pronounced “zhee-clay”) is a newly coined word for the process of making fine art prints from a digital source using ink-jet printing. the word “giclée” is derived from the french language word “le gicler” meaning “nozzle”, or more specifically “gicler” meaning “to squirt, spurt, or spray”. the name has since come to mean any high quality ink-jet print and is often used in galleries and print shops to denote such prints.
all giclées are offered on canvas or on paper (unless otherwise noted). giclées on canvas have painted sides (black) and are varnished.
types of giclées offered:• limited editions• minis• artist proofs• printer proofs• special editions
 











posters
a lithograph print is a reproduction of the original work of art usually done in full color. each color in a print requires a separate pass on the lithographers press, with a minimum of four colors required to obtain the full color spectrum. these colors are created by printing different size dots of colors onto the surface. purchasing a lithograph print is a smart, economic way to own the artist’s best works and attain an authentic signature.











serigraphs
a serigraph print is the same thing as a silkscreen print. it’s a relatively new word given to the old and relatively simple process of silkscreening. these serigraphs were produced by azumi kato fine art in torrence, ca. a master award-winning serigrapher, azumi kato has retired and returned to japan. because of the quality and very limited quantity, these serigraphs are hard to come by, very valuable and highly collectible.
 
all serigraphs are accompanied by a certification of authenticity.
