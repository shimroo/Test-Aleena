                david e. wunsch.
                (updated 1/10/2012)
the legend of uncle
                  willie & the brandy snifters, or how to enjoy
                  playing old-time music without the pitfalls of worldly

                the mid-20th-century old-time appalachian music scene in
                minnesota.
traditional music
                  photo album -- photos of old-time musicians we've
                met, from 1961 - 2007 and counting. this is the same
                site as the link on the brandy snifters page. we're
                listing it here also, because people were having a hard
                time finding it. (2/8/2010).
 traditional music
                  sonic album -- a collection of some things that
                happened to happen while the tape recorder was running,
                and which may be of interest to others besides

 lofgren, johnson,
                  swenson family history -- a brief, extended
                  history of the lofgren, johnson and swenson families
                  who settled near harris, minnesota. the geneaology
                given is intensely boring if you're not a relative, but
                some of the family stories might interest others. they
                prove that truth is not only stranger than fiction, it
                is indistinguishable. warning: the introduction contains
                philosophical thoughts on personal history that some may
                find bizarre (updated 12/2/2013).

                devoted to his family's history (1/28/2006).








selections from lyle's journals






note the dates, as these entries are presented mostly
                as they were originally written, without updating to
                account for more recent information or changes in my
                opinions. if you have any comments, i'm at lylelofgren@visi.com.

west coast business
                  trip, 1967 -- june, 1967, edited and with
                commentary added in the summer of 2005. a peon's-eye
                view of a small part of the military-industrial complex
                as it was in the late 1960s. (9/12/2005).

the deep well of death
                -- june 1978. this short diatribe seems quaint now, but
                i'm not sure why, because the topic is still current.
                (5/3/2005). (note added, 4/25/2011)

the lammergeyer is
                  one of our prettiest birds -- july 1978. reading
                peter matthiesen's the snow leopard sent me to
                the library for some research on the lammergeyer (or
                lammergeier) and tibetan burial practices. it got me to
                thinking about which element i want to return to when i
                die: earth, water, fire, or air. air burial sounds like
                a neat idea, except -- what if i end up being consumed
                by chickens? (11/26/2007)

wyndaweed instruction
                  manual -- october 1979. read carefully before
                assembly. if i were to write it over, i'd put in a lot
                of pointless warnings and cautions, but  i didn't
                foresee all those consumer  lawsuits. 
                (5/3/2005)

arkady -- january
                1981. i try my hand at memoir, attempting to reconstruct
                the thought-processes of a 7-year-old. the result
                is  juvenilia, even though i was 45 when i wrote
                it. people still get irritated with me and say, "will
                you stop that humming?" but, of course, i won't.
                (5/3/2005)

literary news
                -- october 1981. i never would have guessed, back in
                1981, that i'd ever be nostalgic about microfische. sure
                enough, i'm not, but i am nostalgic about walnut
                card catalog cases in libraries, just like i was back
                then. (5/3/2005)

                  procedures -- march, 1992. thirteen years after
                the three mile island nuclear reactor accident, there
                were still lessons to be learned. unfortunately, i don't
                see how learning the lessons will make us any safer.

                september, 1995. except for the white-collar variety,
