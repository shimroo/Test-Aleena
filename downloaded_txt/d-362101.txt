fred swan

a graduate of the u.s. naval academy, fred swan is completely self-taught as an artist.  his meticulous attention to detail gives his paintings an immediately recognizable style. his paintings are filled with nostalgia and warmth.  the extreme realism and beauty of his creations cause others to look to the future and remark, "now that is the kind of peaceful setting i want when i retire."














fred swan

fredâs paintings are found in many private and corporate collections including those of johnson and johnson and the estate of malcolm forbes.  he has been a yankee magazine feature artist, is a past winner of the saturday evening post cover contest, and has been featured in many national publications. 














fred swan

due to the length of time necessary to complete a painting (500 hrs. on average) he is often unable to fulfill the demand for his original acrylics.  each image is richly rural, a way of life experienced by few, but fondly remembered by many.  these qualities have earned swan a lofty reputation as one of our nationâs finest landscape artists.
