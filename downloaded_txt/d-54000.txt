our research
the reputation of our research and teaching faculty is the biggest strength of the department. many faculty members have been recognized both at university and national levels for their excellence in research, education, and service.
focused in six key areas, our faculty and their graduate students conduct research that fights drug-resistant diseases, builds cancer-finding circuits made of dna, trains ai to detect propaganda, and more.
