proudly serving our members in southeast tennessee with safe, reliable, affordable electricity since 1939











founded in 1939, the sequachee valley electric cooperative (svec) was initiated by community visionaries aiming to electrify the valley's rural regions. drawing its name from the local cherokee river, svec uniquely retained the original "sequachee" spelling. with support from the rural electrification administration, svec acquired power lines from the tennessee valley electric power company in august 1939.
by september, they began operations, taking assets from the tennessee electric power company, embarking on a mission to provide affordable, transformative electricity to the community.
