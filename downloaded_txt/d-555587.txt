our flounder, ivar haglund





ivar’s calls the pacific northwest homefrom its early beginnings — with ivar haglund selling fish ‘n chips on seattle's waterfront in 1938 — to today, ivar’s has winged its way to marysville and tacoma, plus a few clam beds in between. the ivar’s dining experience offers 18 fast casual seafood bars and three full-service waterfront-view restaurants: ivar's acres of clams, ivar's salmon house, and ivar's mukilteo landing. ivar's also operates stadium concessions in t-mobile park, lumen field, cheney stadium, and husky stadium. no matter which restaurant you choose, you’ll find the award-winning ivar’s seafood you love.

“keep clam!”ivar haglund  |  flounder

  







  

our storythe northwest dining legacy that is ivar’s began in 1938 with one very entrepreneurial spirit, the late ivar haglund. his future in music and entertaining took a slight detour when his waterfront aquarium needed a vendor to feed its guests. using his own classic northwest seafood recipes, ivar’s was born. this dining destination has since spawned many more restaurants to delight future generations. click the link below to read about the beginnings of our “flounder” as a restaurateur and his wacky promotional antics.more history
