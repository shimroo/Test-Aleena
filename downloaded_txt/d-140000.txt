your city, your chamber of commerce!
the rialto chamber of commerce is a voluntary group of actively concerned businesspeople and citizens who have banded together to advance commercial and civic interests of our community. basically, we are people who know that far more can be accomplished collectively than individually. a chamber of commerce mobilizes these people to form a pool of talents and skills enabling them to accomplish, as a team, in a professional atmosphere, what the individual could not. why are members so excited? because they know this system works for them and for the total community. chambers of commerce broadly reflect their communities, they have become recognized as a central source of information of all sorts about their communities. our members know that the chamber of commerce is their "voice of business" and as such is the one agency working diligently to preserve and enhance the free enterprise system. by investing in the chamber, our members have "hired" the chamber's professional staff to refer clients, to act as resource personnel, to answer questions and to meet individual business needs. your chamber of commerce also increases working opportunities which in turn increase profits.
