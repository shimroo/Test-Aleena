territory acknowledgement college of the rockies serves the communities of the east kootenays. all of the college’s campuses are located in the traditional territory of the ktunaxa people which is also home to the kinbasket people. five first nations bands are located in the regional boundary of the college: four of which are ktunaxa and one is shuswap. additionally, the college partners with the kootenay regional office of the métis nation, bc. we are thankful for all our indigenous partners and are constantly seeking new ways to support the development of our community.
