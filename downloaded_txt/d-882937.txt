the good feeling lasts all year










the third sunday in september each year



missionnational neighborhood day inspires, builds, and sustains                            the neighborhood relationships that provide the foundation                            for civic action and the building of stronger, more                            caring and effective communities.













robert d. putnam(on national neighborhood day)"communities work better ( students perform better, crime rates are  lower, kids are safer, people live longer) when neighbors know one  another better. knowing your neighbor on a first-name basis, as national  neighborhood day suggests, is a surprisingly effective first step toward  a better america."



visionnational neighborhood day was established to reinforce the relationships that form the fabric of our communities. it is a day of simple gatherings to share food, fellowship and fun while re-kindling friendships; welcoming new neighbors; catching up on each others' families, interests and needs.bringing neighbors together builds connectedness. and connectedness builds more satisfying, self-sufficient and effective communities that strengthen our nation as a whole. national neighborhood day is celebrated in neighborhoods across the country each year on the third sunday in september.
