get involved bats are at risk as a result of habitat destruction, the introduction of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. bat populations could continue to decline, and without intervention, these threats could lead to species extinctions. we have the power to help bat populations throughout washington by working together. join us in our mission to increase public awareness and promote a greater appreciation for bats.

white-nose syndromewhite-nose syndrome (wns) is a disease that affects hibernating bats and is caused by a fungus, pseudogymnoascus destructans, or pd for short. pd grows in cold, dark and damp places. it attacks the bare skin of bats while they’re hibernating in a relatively inactive state. as it grows, pd causes bats to become active more than usual and burn up fat they need to survive the winter.
