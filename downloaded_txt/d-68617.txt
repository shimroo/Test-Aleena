2025-february ❤️ happy valentines! ❤️
the home page has received a significant upgrade! here's what you need to know:
            
if you prefer printable puzzles, be sure to select the printable 🖨️ filter.  this will insure that the tiles always navigate to printable puzzles (otherwise, you may get interactive by default). this also weeds out the interactive-only puzzles.
            similarly the interactive 📱 filter weeds out print-only puzzles and insures the tiles link only to the interactive versions.
            if you like both kinds of puzzle, leave these filters unselected.  you'll get the most popular kind of puzzle (interactive vs print) by default, so i suggest you use the phone 📱 and printer 🖨️ icons beneath each puzzle to clearly specify which you want.
            the sudoku filter shows a lot more puzzles, and makes more filter options available, for fans of sudoku variants.
            got some favorites?  use the star ★ icons to bring them to the top of the page! no more hunting!
            enjoy!
