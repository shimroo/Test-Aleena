a
supported life is a life that is rich in qualities a person most 
          desires, and one which shows how connected we all are to each other. 
          
a 
          life which: 



grows 
            from a person's own choices, desires and dreams; 
is 
            not controlled by what kind of services are currently available; 
goes 
            beyond just meeting a person's basic needs, to reaching a rich quality 
            of life;
includes 
            all areas of a person's life; 
is 
            always changing throughout a person's life; 
is 
            the kind of life we all want and is not unique to people who happen 
            to have disabilities.
