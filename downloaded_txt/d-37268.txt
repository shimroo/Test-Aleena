yōkoso!welcome to sengokudaimyo.com—a webpage started by the late anthony j. bryant as the central linking point to shops and various projects, mostly related to medieval japan. it is now maintained and updated in his memory by his friends and students so that it remains available to everyone with an in interest in japanese history.while much of the information in these pages is strictly historical or primarily historical in nature, some also pertain to re-enacting medieval japan in the society for creative anachronism, where tony was an active member, and well respected by the japanese history community.for anyone interested in viewing the original site, it has been maintained in an archive on the site.so, as tony did, we invite you to visit these various sites and we hope you will find them useful and enjoyable. the sites on the links pages are those that we have found informative and entertaining. we hope you shall also find them so.
