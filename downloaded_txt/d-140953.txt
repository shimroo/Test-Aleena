testimonials



have i mentioned how awesome your product [elegant ribbon] is lately?  i know i can be critical at times but i want you guys to know without your control my product would be nothing.  there are still a few things that i need but your product is fantastic.  my product could not look any better than it does.  i will be sending you guys a beta of my software in a few weeks.  you might use it because it is for developers.  once it is finished i will give you guys a few license keys for your use.  i really appreciate you guys and the changes you have made for me." chris herrington, css, inc, usa



"prof-uis is an excellent professional software library that let’s the developer have the focus on the functionality rather the user interface. in combination with the perfect technical support it is unbeatable. if you ever want to sell your software product prof-uis library is a must. i’m looking forward to the next version of this outstanding software." roland ehlert, maxcrc gmbh, germany



"thanks guys, renewing was a no-brainer for us.  we are definitely happy with our decision to go with prof-uis.  after two long years of effort on our new product, the quality and reliability of prof-uis along with your excellent support allowed us to concentrate on the things we do best.  keep up the good work!" bob sabiston, canfit-x software architect, canada



"i am also impressed as to how easy it was to create a custom cell type.  i had originally set about creating one from scratch that would provide a combo box that listed line drawing styles (solid, dashed, dot, etc) as actual lines.  but have since learned that i could just derive my custom type from cextgridcellcombobox and override the onpopuplistboxdrawitem and onpainttext methods to handle the drawing.  so what had started out being a 1.5 day project to create it from scratch, due to learning what had to be included in the class, turned into a ½ hour project." marty barringer, senior principal engineer, usa
