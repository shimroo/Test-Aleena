macky’s bayside bar & grill, where life is good, has been an ocean city staple since 1994. with ocean city's population growing week by week, macky's takes pride in its small town community feel. whether its delicious food with family or a night out with friends macky’s is the place to be. the dog-friendly oc landmark offers an open-air bar and restaurant, bayfront tables and modern american pub food. macky’s is open during the season from may through september and features lunch, dinner, happy hour, plenty of nightlife fun and the best sunsets on the bay!





























lauren h. 2024“solid happy hour and great sunset views. the food was great - especially the jerk chicken strips.”
