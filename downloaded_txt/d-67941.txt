  hayes equipment has shut down as of august 1st, 2023
 after 22 years serving the ponca city area we've decided to close up shop for good.it's been a major pain the last 2+ years to get enough inventory to supply our normal mower sales quantities. parts continue to be slow in coming in with unprecedented backorders from various brands making it a nightmare to keep up with our normal service levels in the repair shop.we want to thank our 1000's of local equipment customers for their support over the years! it's been a pleasure!


   




    for our hayes products customers throughout the u.s and abroad...
