the passing of alvin fielder january 5, 2019 ended the creative run of the kidd jordan-joel futterman-alvin fielder trio, but kidd and joel carry on. together these three sympathetic artists had brought listening and interacting to a new level. they were dedicated to spontaneous in-the-moment improvisation based on their skilled abilities. in memory of alvin, i created an album/slideshow containing a chronolgy of my photographs of alvin. i added the album to the top of an updated page which featured the trio member, kidd, joel and alvin. click on this  link or the photo to connect to the page.

i provided the cover photographs and design for the question, a new book by joel futterman. i also helped format and edit the text of this unique volume. check it out.

 pianist joel futterman's creative energies have burst forth in this unusual and compelling volume. joel's empathy for humanity is paramount. for a world with great economic disparities, and in social, political, and spiritual turmoil; joel provides a series of dialogues of questions and parables that advance the search for inner and outer peace. the question could be the answer.

 
the question is available by direct purchase (click) from joel's web site.



the reflection cd release by pianist joel futterman ia a two-cd set of 2014 solo recordings demonstrating joel's multiple musical perspectives. i provided the photo/graphic and did the layout for the package.
marc medwin wrote: 

if his creation series is a compendium of his pianistic techniques, reflection distills and augments them, documenting the continued development of a master technician, a probing intellect and a spirit whose adventurousness and creativity know no boundaries and who accepts only the freedom that comes from music born of dedication and created in the moment.
