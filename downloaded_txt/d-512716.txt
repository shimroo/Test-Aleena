financial market and economic research







crestmont research develops provocative insights on the financial markets, including the stock market, interest rates, and investment philosophy. the research focuses on the drivers and characteristics of secular stock market cycles, the impact of the inflation rate and interest rates on the stock and bond markets, and a conceptual approach toward investment strategy that is applicable to the current market environment.


research objectives
the objective of the research and its publication on this site is to present rational perspectives based upon a diligent analysis of historical data. through understanding and developing perspectives on that data, vital new knowledge is formulated. armed with that knowledge, we can then start to make informed decisions.
crestmont’s research is intended to be observation-based rather than prediction-oriented. its purpose is to provide information and perspectives to assist in rational decision-making. the research does not provide predictions or recommendations on investment alternatives, although you may find its implications for investment strategy quite compelling.
stock market
the overall market is highly volatile and affected by generally long secular cycles. you may wonder is it worth the risk?. further, returns in the stock market depend upon the level of and trend for the inflation rate. in this section, you’ll gain insights toward the obvious question: what can we expect from here?.
ten, twenty, or even thirty years is not long enough to ensure successful returns in the stock market. current and recent levels for the p/e ratio suggest that expected returns will be disappointing for many investors. pundits are professing, “returns will improve when the economy begins to recover!” but hope is not a strategy.
though traditional wisdom relates p/e ratios to interest rates, that relationship works only in periods of positive inflation. with the risk of higher inflation or deflation looming on the horizon, the analysis titled “p/e ratios & inflation” will clarify that p/e’s are driven by inflation. as well, see “stock market returns & volatility” for a surprisingly strong relationship between the level of volatility in the stock market and its direction.
“financial physics” represents the interconnected relationships among several key elements in the economy and the financial markets–relationships that determine the stock market’s overall direction. this presentation will provide a highly provocative and insightful perspective on the relationship of the economy (the source of wealth) and the equity markets (the measure of equity wealth). whereas other presentations present analyses of historical data to provide perspectives, this analysis is dedicated to exploring the fundamental factors and economic relationships that drive trends and valuations in the financial markets.
harry markowitz, nobel prize co-recipient for modern portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model, published “portfolio selection” in the journal of finance during 1952. he led with a critical point: “the process of selecting a portfolio may be divided into two stages. the first stage starts with observation and experience and ends with beliefs about the future performances of available securities. the second stage starts with the relevant beliefs about future performances and ends with the choice of the portfolio. this paper is concerned with the second stage.” as markowitz emphasizes, it is the investor’s responsibility to use “observation and experience” to develop “beliefs about the future performances.” crestmont’s research is developed to provide practical insights for investors who don’t have 75 to 100 years to wait for historical average returns.
interest rates
short-term interest rates (one year or less) are generally determined by the federal reserve; long-term interest rate yields are driven by the inflation rate or inflation expectations. the relationship between interest rates and inflation was not evident before the 1960’s. current research now suggests implications for the future.
though there are occasional, very limited periods that break the general rule, crestmont research’s the 6/50 rule states: “interest rates will change by at least 50 basis points (0.5%) within the next 6 months.” there’s almost 50 years of history–virtually without exception–in our favor. chances are that the change will be a good bit more than that, too. see the details and charts titled “the 6/50 rule.”
economy
uncertainties about the economy pose a unique crossroads for the current decade and beyond. further research and analysis is needed to assess conventional wisdom for myth and insight.

outlook: how crestmont research forecasts
view item


the first principle of investing is that “past performance is not indicative of future results.” yet, many in the investment industry and investor community rely heavily on the rear-view mirror. product summaries boast returns for the past 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. some investors buy currently hot stocks as they cull losers without much regard for their potential. too often, it’s human nature for us to anchor on yesterday’s trend to extrapolate tomorrow’s outcome.
the most common misunderstanding about crestmont research is that its articles and charts follow that industry norm. but, crestmont’s identification of secular stock market cycles is not based upon recent eras of strong or weak returns. instead, crestmont is keenly focused on the outlook for most investors’ horizons—periods of five to twenty years. secular calls are driven by current conditions and outlook, not by past trends.
this two-page article describes the key principles underlying crestmont’s research and related charts and writings. it closes with links to selected pieces that epitomize crestmont’s work.




the big shift: a secular realignment of profits and p/e
view item


why are reported profits for the s&p 500 index so much higher than normalized profits? although implied earnings per share (eps) under shiller’s cape p/e10 and crestmont’s normalized p/e are expected to be near $90 in 2019, the current forecast for as-reported gaap eps is $165.
why are wages relatively stagnant overall (and declining as a percentage of the economy) while corporate profits increase as a percentage of gdp?
why does the stock market appear so overvalued to many analysts when, in reality, it may be near fairly valued?
in summary, (1) increased profit margins are the result of slower economic growth; (2) the related increase in eps will be offset by a lower market p/e and thus will not provide stock market gains; and (3) future returns will remain muted despite an apparently lower level for p/e in the future.
note: the material in this article is so provocative that the concepts are not affecting other material on the website at this time.
