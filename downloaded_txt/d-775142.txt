the museum needs your help!we’ve started an emergency fundraiser to help cover the unforeseen cost of replacing one of our heat pumps.  anything you can contribute would be much appreciated!  simply click the link below to help us meet our goal.





 
 
the museum is testing out a new online donation platform called zeffy, which is specifically geared towards nonprofits. zeffy is free for nonprofits to use, and doesn’t charge a credit card processing fee. when you click the link below to make a donation, you will be asked to add a contribution to keep the platform free. if you do not wish to contribute, or you would like to contribute a different amount, simply click the 17% box and select ‘other’ (as you can see on to the right). then you can put in whatever number you would like, including zero.

essex county museum & historical society building



about our museum
essex and its county seat, tappahannock, lie on the beautiful rappahannock river in virginia’s middle peninsula. the essex county museum, founded in 1996, and the essex county historical society joined forces in 2006 to celebrate the heritage of the town, county, river, and its people and is now the essex county museum and historical society (ecmhs).
the museum houses a number of exhibits that include pre-historic through modern displays of life in essex and on the rappahannock river. in addition to these collections, the museum has a research room with a small library as well as a gift shop with handcrafted jewelry, home accessories, art, books, children’s toys and games, and more!   all proceeds from the shop benefit ecmhs’s programs and operations.
outreach is an important component of the museum’s mission and ecmhs collaborates with other museums on the northern neck and middle peninsula to bring a “history on the go” program to local elementary schools. the essex county museum also has a variety of other educational programs that are offered either at the museum or in another venue as well as live and virtual programs throughout the year that are offered to the community.
