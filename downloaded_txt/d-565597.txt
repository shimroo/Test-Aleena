the california alarm association (caa) recently announced the launch of the women in the security evolution (wise), a committee that is dedicated to supporting, empowering, and promoting women across all disciplines within the security industry spectrum of professional roles.

about the caa 
the california alarm association develops and manages programs to benefit members and to promote the growth of professionalism in the electronic security industry throughout the state of california. membership dues provide the foundation for funding these programs, but we rely on the financial support of individuals and companies to expand existing programs and launch new initiatives. these non-dues revenues are critical for the protection of the industry in which we all make our livelihood, and to preserve our ability to enhance public safety in our communities. our mission:

serve our members and associates by being the industry advocate and liaison with public safety agencies, government bureaus, and licensing, standards and regulation bodies.
serve the people of california by being a reliable and trusted resource for safety and security information and services.

what our members say about the caa  













dawn smithtotal monitoring services“while working for king central, i became their regional account manager.  i wanted to be aware of what was going on in the industry so i began attending the sacramento area alarm association meetings. i did not expect the true friendships i have made over the years through the different associations.  i carry some of the people i’ve met through the years very close to my heart.” 



tim westphal



bay alarm company


"our family has benefited from being part of the caa for decades.  the caa is a critical part of running our alarm business, the work we do to develop great relationships with law enforcement and ensure legislation is in alignment with our industry is priceless.  spending time and working together with suppliers and fellow alarm company owners is just good business."





jason canfieldpremier security services, inc.“caa is great! we always enjoy the networking and knowledge gained at their events.”
