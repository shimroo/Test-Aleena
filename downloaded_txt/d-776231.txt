people for plants

there has never been a more important time to support and protect the natural wonders that grow on south african soil. the botanical society of south africa (npo 003-394) is a member-driven organisation that offers citizen scientists, amateur nature enthusiasts, the general public, and environmental experts the opportunity to join hands and be a part of the solutions to biodiversity challenges across the country. our mission is to win the hearts, minds and material support of individuals and organisations, wherever they may be, for the conservation, cultivation, study and wise use of the indigenous flora and vegetation of south africa.

conserving our natural heritage, for all, forever

the botanical society was formed more than a century ago to help develop and support the country’s national botanical gardens. botsoc’s mission has since grown to supporting plant conservation across south africa through its branches and by working with key partners.

reflections of spring on the highveld plateau

reflections of spring on the highveld plateau

as earth’s axial tilt brings the southern hemisphere closer to the sun, days become longer and the cold grip of winter loosens its hold. the shift in temperature and day length triggers the arrival of spring flowering across south africa. while the iconic floral displays of the west coast signal the end of the growing season, the species in gauteng are breaking dormancy in anticipation of the summer rains and the start of the new growth cycle. 



















ushering in the richtersveld desert botanical garden

n the far northwestern corner of our beloved country lies the world’s most diverse mountain desert landscape – home to an astonishing assortment of plant and animal life. for most of us, the idea of a desert landscape would bring up images of desolate sand dunes, extreme heat, the absence of water and indeed a place that is inhospitable to life. but that is not what you will find in the richtersveld. despite the harshness of its climate, it teams with life and biological diversity – making this unique region one of south africa’s priority conservation areas. over the past several decades, the steady decline in biodiversity due to the impacts of mining, habitat loss, land use change, climate change and plant poaching has once again focused the lens on the fragility of the arid and semi-arid ecosystems, particularly in the ai/ais richtersveld transfrontier park located on both sides of the orange river (original name !garib meaning river or great river, also known as groot rivier or gariep). in response to these mounting conservation pressures, on the south african side of the river the richtersveld national park, with its unique joint management arrangement between the community and south african national parks (sanparks), has been quietly partnering with the south african national biodiversity institute’s (sanbi) karoo desert and kirstenbosch national botanical garden.
during the week of the 19th of august 2024, a historical celebration took place to highlight the importance of this partnership and to acknowledge the key role of the richtersveld communities. the event took place at the sendelingsdrift rest camp and was co-hosted by sanparks, sanbi  and the richtersveld community management committee (rcmc). the main objective of the event was to pause, reflect and celebrate the amazing achievements of collaborative work that has taken place particularly over the past four years between these two sister organisations.
