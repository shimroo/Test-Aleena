the world’s most popular adult & youth racing class. 



the ilca is a single-handed racing dinghy. each dinghy is virtually identical whether they are brand new or 10 years old, meaning that the sailor wins the race, not the boat. the ilca is a challenging boat that rewards athleticism, subtle steering and trimming techniques, as well as tactical excellence. it is a singlehanded olympic class boat for both men, and women, and is sailed at the club, national and international levels. with over 200,000 boats in 140 countries, it is the world’s most popular adult and youth racing sailboat.ilca 4 • ilca 6 • ilca 7
