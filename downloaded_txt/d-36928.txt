      i keep getting javascript errors; what should i do?
                                                      
	older browsers have limited or no javascript functionality. if you are
	using netscape navigator 1.x, 2.x or 3.x, microsoft internet explorer
	2.x or 3.x, or some other oddball browser (including webtv:
	mozilla/3.0 webtv/1.2 compatible; msie 2.0), you will need to upgrade
	to a newer browser to obtain javascript functionality (that means you
	need a browser that supports javascript). if my pages crash your
	browser, well, sorry... perhaps now is the time you should update your
	browser to current industry standards!  what, you can't update yur
	browser 'cuz yur at your place of employment? hey... tell them to
	upgrade their network software so you can be more efficient wasting
	your time on their dime...
