we drove through the hidden lake community many times before we finally built and moved here.  the community is beautiful, well maintained and the views are spectacular.  we absolutely love the life we have here.  it feels as though we are at a vacation resort. there’s always something to do, the neighbors are friendly and the lake is beautiful.  it really is the perfect spot in all of southeast michigan!

l & l, hidden lake resident

 



my wife and i love calling hidden lake our home – the waterfalls, beautiful sunsets, walking paths, the lake - it’s like we are on vacation every day!

when we considered moving to a lake home we developed a must-have list to help keep us on track.  as we visited the lakes and their communities within the area, listing both the pros and the cons hidden lake won hands-down.
	it is truly resort living right outside our back door
