“we don’t underestimate the behind-the-scenes that makes this place run smooth and safe and creates an environment that we continue to want to return to.”— kim family












“the chapel speaker has reminded us that we are called to put jesus first in our lives and even after vacation is over and we are back to our normal routines, we can’t just live on autopilot. we must be intentional in our day-to-day lives  or him.”— andrews family
