“st. peter’s has provided our family belonging centered in faith. since 2007 we have been active members in the parish community and participated in a number of ministries including cornerstone, st martin’s soup kitchen, altar serving, faith formation, and cyo. each volunteer opportunity has allowed us to be present to service and blessed us with opportunities to build long term bonds with members of the parish and the river edge community.”
the lukich family











“we were looking for a church to call home and everyone at st. peter’s welcomed us like we were family."
the kero family











"st. peter's is a place to call home, where all are welcome to celebrate the liturgy joyfully. st. peter's has shown me the power of a strong catholic community."
nicole c.











“our first memory of st. peter’s was attending mass on ash wednesday, while house hunting in river edge 10 years ago. we felt a connection with the church and its parishioners and it was a key reason we chose to move to this town."
the philbin family
