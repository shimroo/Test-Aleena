what is digital product (or brand) integration?
digital product (or brand) integration is the insertion of a brand or product into a television show or movie segment using computer technology to embed the image seamlessly into the content. it is also referred to as virtual advertising or digital product placement.

      digital product and brand integration breaks open a new range of possibilities for both advertisers and broadcasters, providing the opportunity to insert a brand in valuable content, in-program, unobtrusive yet guaranteed to be seen by the viewer. it provides new ways of exposure for advertisers and unleashes previously non-existent revenue opportunities.


what are some of the benefits of digital product integration for producers, rights holders and broadcasters?

create new inventory
retain clean masters (which can later be branded and monetized)
control brand exposure in your properties as they grow in time (syndication)
target different markets with different advertisers or products
close sales and integrate advertisers at any moment in production cycle up to a few weeks before air date
