            blog:  a
        journey into herbal and natural healing 

welcome to mystic naturals

just released .... a
          journey into herbal & natural healing ebook. from years of
          teaching herbal and natural healing, i have compiled a comprehensive
          book including my herbal recipes for mystic naturals' product
        line.

 
 
mystic naturals has
          been offering quality products for bath, body and relaxation to enhance
          the quality of your life for the past 11 years. due to the rising costs
          of raw materials and shipping, production costs have decreased profit
          margins enough that it is not feasible to continue producing products.
        mystic naturals closed its doors may 2008. 
this positive change allows me to
          concentrate more on my healing practice and classes. be sure
        to  visit the
        secret garden healing oasis, my teaching & healing center offering
        reiki sessions and certification, chakra balancing, herbal workshops
        and intuitive readings.
