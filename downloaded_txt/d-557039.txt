the north coast schools insurance group (ncsig) was founded in 1977 in eureka, california, as a way for member school districts to manage their own costs and coverage, after many years buying workers’ compensation coverage from the state compensation insurance fund. the program was formalized as a joint powers authority (jpa) on july 1, 1978, as a self-funded workers’ compensation pool.  a self-funded program covering property & liability risk exposures was added on july 1, 1982. 
in 1986, ncsig sponsored a meeting in mckinleyville, california, to form an excess risk pool with other northern california districts.  this jpa grew into what is now known as the northern california regional liability excess fund (ncr) and provides coverage to over 364 k-12 school agencies throughout northern and central california.

 

currently, ncsig consists of k-12 school districts, charter schools and offices of education in humboldt and del norte counties.  ncsig participates in excess insurance programs through ncr, as well as the schools association for excess risk (safer) and the protected insurance program for schools (pips) jpas.
