welcome to prairie view golf club







located on 206 acres in hamilton county, prairie view golf club is the only robert trent jones, jr. golf course in indiana. 
robert trent jones, jr. blended 18 holes of traditional golf design into the natural beauty created by the rolling prairie, towering oaks and sycamores that characterize our site on the banks of the white river. a clear running stream that meanders through four holes, natural wetlands, and five serene lakes placed strategically throughout the course serve to complete a truly unique playing experience.
consistently rated among the top courses in indiana, prairie view golf club has hosted all major indiana pga and indiana golf association championships, and we continue to be on the iga/pga’s ‘major venue rotation’.
