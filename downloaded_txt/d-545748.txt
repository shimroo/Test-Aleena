welcome to m&k soundfor more than four decades, m&k sound has been held in the highest regard by the audio press, the film and music industries as well as by home users seeking the finest loudspeakers for music and home theater.

building on a truly unique heritage and a strong market presence that transcends the traditional boundaries between professional and consumer audio, m&k sound pledges to continue to offer performance, reliability and value for money that are second to none.





m&k sound launches thx® certified dominus iw500 reference in-wall loudspeakerthe iw500 is m&k sound’s most state of the art and sophisticated loudspeaker to date and includes several technological advances, allowing it to pass stringent testing and receive thx certified dominus status. the iw500 is a three way loudspeaker sporting a true 92 db of sensitivity with all its drivers mounted in a vertical line to achieve precise on and off axis audio performance requirements for superb imaging. ‘it just sounds real’.
also a first for the industry, the iw500 is the only thx certified dominus loudspeaker that can be mounted either vertically or horizontally as a center channel. in either scenario, whether placed into a behind screen baffle wall or masonry surrounding a flat panel display, the performance characteristics are identical, leveraging increased flexibility for residential or professional installations.

m&k took on a lofty task to design the highest performance and most powerful in-wall speaker for ultra-high fidelity in expansive home and private spaces of up to 6,500 cubic feet in size, and with up to a 20-foot viewing distance from the screen. we are pleased to verify that the incredibly detailed audio design from m&k sound has ensured that their iw500 met these high standards of excellence. this is a spectacular accomplishment of which they should be very proud.

it’s the best subwoofer i’ve encountered in two decades of reviewingthe m&k sub’s ability to dig deep and play loud proved mighty impressive – at one point i was afraid it was going to wake the dead in a nearby cemetery. so, the x15+ shines with movie soundtracks, but can a 15-inch sub work equally well with music? yes!

we’ve been using m&k sound thx speaker systems on the star wars films in both the sound design and picture editing suites. the m&k sound thx speakers’ accuracy and imaging qualities let us hear all the nuances of dialogue, music and sound effects at every stage of the creative process. this gives us the ability to create the powerful, yet subtle and persuasive soundtracks that are the hallmark of the star wars films.
