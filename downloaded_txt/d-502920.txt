                i’ve written a capsule for bixby, for the the voice assistant for samsung phones, in collaboration with duck and doge.
the nice things capsule gives you kind quotes, and allows you to leave kind quotes for others, using your voice.
the capsule has terms of service and a privacy policy.

                i’ve written a capsule for bixby, the voice assistant for samsung phones.
my brain capsule remembers things for you, and makes it easy to recall those things again using your voice.
the capsule has terms of service and a privacy policy.
the code for this capsule is publicly visible: capsule and server.
i’ve written a bixby capsule with aws tutorial about how you can write a capsule like this yourself, and use aws to store user data in the cloud.

this post came with the victor-hugo boilerplate, i’m keeping it for a while until i learn all the tricks in markdown,
as it demonstrates some of what markdown is capable of doing.
