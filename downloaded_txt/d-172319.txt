lisa jane hanson


over the past 47 years of marriage, we have bought 8 homes and sold 7. of the many realtors we’ve worked with lisa hanson is the best. she helps you set a price that will get it sold quickly but without being undervalued. she is a great communicator. available 24/7. responds quickly. keeps you in formed throughout the process. she helps you find your dream home and doesn’t push you into something that’s not right for you. she is a joy to work with. always positive but realistic. puts your interests first. we’d love to work with her again.

tom inglesby


after shopping around for realtors, tom was miles above and beyond. being a first-time home buyer is huge and tom helped me find the perfect home in a prime location in a very competitive market. i couldn't ask for more. i'm so happy with my experience and purchase i can't even begin to put it in to words. decades of knowledge and experience shines right through from the moment you meet him. his knowledge of the market, contracting and processes has left me with the utmost in praise. i've already recommended him to anyone i hear even thinking of purchasing a home. i just wish i had more savings so i could start working with tom for my second home!" with tom guiding me i had to bid much higher to get the house above the 6 other offers.

tom inglesby


i purchased a house remotely with tom's help. i found him very knowledgeable about the market and knew what to look for when buying a home. he was very responsive and called/texted right away. he helped me inspected the property before making an offer which helped a lot as i am out of state. after we got the house, he helped me  connect with the property management company and even helped me did some cleaning/minor repairs so i can get the property ready to rent. 
he has a wealth of experience.

gloria hahn


gloria hahn provided excellent service far above and beyond the duties expected from a real estate agent. the sale of my property was fraught with extraordinary hurdles, which she took the leadership to overcome as i was an out of state property owner. i give her the highest recommendation as a   professional of exceptional character and perseverance.
