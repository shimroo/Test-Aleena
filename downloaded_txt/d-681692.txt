mcgill's 10 faculties and 12 schools offer programs of study in some 300 areas on two campuses. 
it's an exciting place to study. great thinkers pass through our gates. 
this website will give you access to the university's archived course calendars, which describe the university's programs and courses, between 2004 and 2015. this format has since been succeeded by the ecalendar (www.mcgill.ca/study), and is supplemented by the pdf archives available here.
