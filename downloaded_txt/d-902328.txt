welcome home to dunsmuir













start with an endless blue sky. punctuate the vista with rugged snow-frosted mountains and the highest free-standing volcano in north america. fold the land into a canyon… through its center runs a river bountiful with granddaddy trout and world-class fishing.right beside the river, set down an old-fashioned town with no stop lights, no parking meters, no traffic, and few worries. step back to a simpler time, a time when shopkeepers ask, “how’s the family doing?” or people smile as they pass on the street.













whether you are looking for adventure and excitement… or rest and relaxation… your adventure begins in dunsmuir. one warning: when you visit, you may never want to leave your “new home” again.
