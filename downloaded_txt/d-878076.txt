the 7 commandments ing-d's moral code for mankind







the noahide (or noachide) moral code of seven universal commandments was given to noah and his children after the flood. it assured them that humanity would never degenerate into a jungle again. it prohibits (1) idolatry, (2) blasphemy, (3) homicide, (4) forbidden relations, (5) robbery, and (6) eating meat that was taken from a still-living animal (cruelty to animals), and it also includes a requirement (7) for societies to establish courts of justice. the details included in these fundamental commandments provide the guidelines for truly ethical behavior.

this divine code is the foundation of all true morality. ask noah teaches about these eternal commandments in the light of their sources in the torah of moses, along with insights about the nature of creation and the important roles of all people as individuals and members of society. by fulfilling our potential within the context of this covenant, the spiritual goal for the creation is reached. this is how the world becomes a beautiful gem. where g-d will dwell with us in a revealed way!

g-d‚Äôs holy name
the sanctity of all human life

the property of other people

the 7 noahide commandments
g-d gave the first six commandments to adam and hava (eve). these were repeated to noah after the flood, and a seventh was added, when g-d established the covenant of the rainbow with noah and all of the world‚Äôs creatures. at mount sinai, g-d taught the torah‚Äôs precepts through moses, including g-d‚Äôs directive for all gentiles to observe the 7 noahide laws. a gentile merits to receive a place in the eternal future world to come, in the messianic era, through careful and pious observance of these universal commandments. information about the noahide laws in the biblical text and their great significance is given in the categories below.



an introduction to the 7 noahide commandments
g-d gave six commandments to adam, and he added a seventh in the covenant of the rainbow with noah.



sources and timeline for the 7 commandments

the prohibition of blasphemy means not curse the creator as he is known by his holy names.

one must be very careful about theft, since there are many details and one naturally covets money.



the prohibition of murder and injury
the noahide prohibition of murder is given in genesis 9:6, ‚Äúwhoever sheds the blood of man, among man, his blood shall be shed.



the prohibition of forbidden sexual relations
genesis states, "a man shall leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife, and they shall become one flesh".



prohibition of eating meat of a live animal; animal welfare/humane slaughter
don't eat meat removed from a living land mammal or bird, such as bobbed lambs' tails.

excerpts from entry for 19th shevat in ‚Äúhayom yom,‚Äù compiled by the lubavitcher rebbe:
in the words of rambam [maimonides],* "to know that there is a first being, who caused the existence of all beings... the knowledge of this principle is a positive command, as it is said, i am the eternal your g-d."
this is a mitzva [commandment] relating to mind and intellect... it is the duty of the mind and intellect to bring this faith to a level of knowledge and comprehension. this is the meaning of, "to know that there is a first being;" the mitzva specifies comprehension and intellectual grasp, as written in torah... "serve him with a whole heart" [chronicles i 28:9], and it is also written, "know this day [and consider it in your heart, that the l-rd, he is g-d in heaven above, and upon the earth below; there is none else]." [deut. 4:39]
*mishneh torah, foundations of the torah 1:1.




from the entry for 5th of tevet in ‚Äúhayom yom,‚Äù compiled by the lubavitcher rebbe:
when moshiach [the true messiah] comes, we will realize the greatness of acknowledgement [belief] and earnestness, everyone's pure faith in g-d and his torah and commandments. human comprehension ‚Äì even on its highest level ‚Äì is limited. but faith is a feeling that is boundless. moshiach will explain the magnificent achievement of earnest service to g-d flowing from the heart.
