3 yrs 4mths





wow! i did not blog for 3yrs and 4mths! 

just some updates now, i'm a mother of 2 now... hehehehhee and while i'm blogging now, i have to do alot of other stuff like feeding my 1st kid, megan-3 yrs old, as well as looking after my 10mth old boy who are crawling around the whole hse! and even pulling my cloths, my bra... =s oh my........

actually i should thank facebook for its existence. ever since we all have fb, i did not update pics or blog here anymore but in fb. so in fb, i have all the pics from the day i admit to sdmc to deliver my 1st kid, megan up to now that megan is 3yrs 4mths old and ethan is already 10mth old.  

guess i should start to blog again, i hope to really find time! :)

alright, that's it for today and let's see when will be my next update... eehehehee...

god bless everyone!

god is good, all the time. all the time, god is good! ;p
