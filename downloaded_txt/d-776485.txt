    about us
  














choose quality over convenience  the convenience of location and transportation, while often important considerations, should take a “back seat” when deciding where a patient should be dialyzed.  the two most important factors to consider are the dialysis center’s rates of mortality and its rates of transplantation.




    how to choose a dialysis center
  






























a difference in dialysis careour nephrologists have many years of dialysis experience and are “hands on”, monitoring patients closely, reviewing their results, and making the proper adjustments to make sure each patient is kept as healthy as possible.



























at lower manhattan dialysis center, we are proud of our proven record with regard to patient care.we have more transplants and fewer deaths than expected, according to federal government reports. at our dialysis centers, we pride ourselves in maintaining the highest standard of medical care, which leads to better outcomes.
