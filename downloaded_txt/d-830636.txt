textbook sales & buyback


save money by purchasing textbooks for a fraction of the original publisher’s cost and free up revenue by selling your overstock and obsolete textbooks. our client services manager can meet with you to evaluate your inventory and write a check to your school for any books that have value. we can also arrange for a recycling pick up of your discarded titles.
