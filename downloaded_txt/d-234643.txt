            nascar hall of famer jeff gordon ready to partner with tom cruise on 'days of thunder' sequel

nascar hall of famer jeff gordon wants a “days of thunder” sequel and said at daytona international speedway that he’s been in touch with tom cruise about making the project come to life. the hollywood reporter reported in november that cruise had talked to paramount about a follow-up to his 1990 nascar racing film. the original was a critically panned summer blockbuster that was largely lampooned throughout the nascar industry for its exaggeration and overindulgence. gordon said he had talked to cruise about another “thunder” movie.

            what is a polar vortex? us gets a taste of the arctic this week

he term “polar vortex” usually refers to the gigantic circular upper air weather pattern in the arctic region, enveloping the north pole. it is a normal pattern that is stronger in the winter and keeps some of the coldest weather bottled up near the north pole. but at times some of the vortex can break off or move south, bringing unusually cold weather south and permitting warmer weather to creep up north. this week, parts of the u.s. are experiencing the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. weather forces in the arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the north pole into the u.s. and europe.
