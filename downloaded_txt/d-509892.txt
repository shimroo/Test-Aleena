keyboard_arrow_leftkeyboard_arrow_right••••••welcome!welcome to the website of the fairfax genealogical society (fxgs)! the society provides education and training for family history researchers in the fairfax county, virginia, area. although based in fairfax, many of our members are not native to the area, so our research endeavors are not restricted to local genealogy. indeed our interests are national and international in scope, as may be reflected in the breadth of our varied special interest groups (sigs). we invite you to join us for our next program and, of course, we would love for you to consider membership in our society.upcoming eventsupcoming events
