u.s. route 6 (us 6), also called the grand army of the republic highway, a name that honors an american civil war veterans association, runs east-northeast from bishop, california to provincetown, massachusetts. the route has been modified several times: longest routing, from 1936 to 1964, had its western terminus at long beach, california. during this time, us 6 was the longest highway in the country!
