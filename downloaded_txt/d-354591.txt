we aspire to be our customers' most valuable supplier


in september 2023, the delaware valley floral group celebrated its 64th anniversary, a milestone for the company that was originally founded as delaware valley wholesale florist by bob sr. and doris wilkins in 1959. their journey in the floral industry had commenced around twelve years earlier, when bob operated a small retail flower business just four miles away from our current location in sewell, nj. in those early days, he cultivated flowers and plants in three greenhouses and supplied cut flowers to wholesale florists at the philadelphia flower market on ludlow street.
the narrative unfolds with a twist when, after several years, a floral wholesaler recognized bob’s talents and invited him to join their ranks as a flower salesman. flourishing in this role, bob and doris eventually entertained the idea of establishing their own wholesale florist venture in southern new jersey. upon making the pivotal decision, they sold their home, acquired a truck, leased a modest building in pitman, nj, and thus gave birth to “dvwf.”
today, the dvfg stands as one of the largest floral distribution and logistics companies in the united states, operating with four separate company divisions; dvflora, freshblooms, flower transfer logistics, and transflora.
spanning five decades, dv has been enriched by three generations of family involvement, dedicated employees, steadfast customers, supportive suppliers, and numerous other business associates. the fusion of these elements has played a pivotal role in shaping the company into what it is today!
