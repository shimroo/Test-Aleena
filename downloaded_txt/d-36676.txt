					new ground, broken
				

those featured in the winter 2025 wpi journal are using technology to break new ground in a variety of industries. morgan stanton, phd ’14, has created a “uterus in a dish” to provide the biological material needed to accelerate the development of gynecological treatments; two groups of alumni are using ai in industries not known to embrace technology; and assistant professor jagannath jayachandran and his team are challenging commonly held beliefs about why things burn and explode. in addition, read about phd student lydia ellen tonani-penha’s quest to extract water from the surface of mars; how cider donut connoisseur alex schwartz ’09 follows a generalist path; the origins of common tech terms according to assistant teaching professor erica brozovsky; and why associate professor elizabeth long lingo has a bicycle wheel in her office.
