bi-gender
a new word for a very old idea. 
two-spirited peoples have been around for as long as there have been people.
recent terms  that attempt to define us, such as transgendered or "gender dysphorics" are inadequate
to describe what is first and
foremost a spiritual state.
gender expression comes in a variety of forms ranging from cross-dressing to
sexual reassignment surgery. but in all cases there is a common element: 
the desire to express yourself as an individual and as a gender, other than
that you were born with.
birth gender vs. spiritual gender.
this site is based on a few beliefs and here is one of the most important.
we believe that the plumbing that one is born with is secondary to the person you want to be.
birth gender may well govern what is put on your drivers license...but it is
your spiritual gender that governs how you express your life.
hopefully this site will open dialogue and understanding in this area.
