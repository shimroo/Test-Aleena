pci compliance

it is our commitment to participants to ensure the software and services used for processing transactions is compliant with standards established by the pci security standards council. both epay and our processors are certified annually as “pci complaint” with all the necessary scanning completed by an approved scanning vendor (“asv”). this includes an audit of our epay e-commerce application that helps remove the burden for e-commerce pci validation from our participants.
 
in line with industry best practices, our online solutions offer transparency to your constituents, when they click away from your website over to our secure hosted page they are notified that they are doing so. this in turn helps lessen your pci burden to the lowest level possible for e-commerce.  learn more here
