folk music  folk songs  are a part of 
      history. they have always been important not only to the individuals who 
      made and perpetuated them, but to the community of people all over the 
      world. they are about incidents, people, times, places, and feelings that 
      we all share (regardless of how we express them). it is known that most 
      people who are true classicists (like spike is) also appreciate and enjoy 
      folk music  even bluegrass. everybody likes to tap their feet and sing a 
      few words.

      i made charts for all these songs because i love them, and we enjoy 
      playing and singing them. we are not professional musicians, and receive 
      no money for our musical endeavors. 

      i assume that those who enjoy this site and use this collection of charts 
      are doing it for purposes of individual pleasure and/or scholarship. 

      with regard to the huge collection of miscellaneous folk songs, in cases 
      where i knew the composer, it is so noted. where i do not know, of course 
      there is no such notation. if one of the songs i have in my collection is 
      yours, please so inform me, so i can give proper credit, or remove the 
      song.

      if any words or chords need correction, please so inform me. 

      in this collection, there are several folksongs that show no chords. that 
      is only because i dont have them and thus far, have been unable to find 
      them. there are some songs for which i dont even know the melodies. 
      heres what to do:

      if you have a favorite melody or a favorite chord progression, even some 
      riffs and hot licks, use that stuff on a song that you dont recognize. 
      who cares? it will be fun! folk songs evolve in just that fashion. there 
      are probably 100 different melodies, with definite harmonies and chord 
      progressions, for the song that we know as scarborough fair. they are 
      all lovely. if you dont know a melody, devise it yourself  it might even 
      be better than the standard melody (if there is one). 

      many of these songs have a narrative appended near the top of the song. 
      these songs are from roger mcguinn's folk den, and the narrative is his. 

this website was created and is 
      maintained for me by jamie the webmistress.  another good place for 
      web design and 
      printing is available from one of our neighbors up north. 
      


      shalom, from spike the grate.
