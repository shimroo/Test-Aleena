social media is my number one outlet for prayer right now. not the only one, but where i lay bare my prayers for the world at the moment. i figured this would raise eyebrows. but just exactly “how wrong” is this, if at all? if prayer is “letting my heart be broken by the things that break the heart of continue reading

the value of the network is for common good

leave a reply 



i stay on platforms like twitter/x and also this one, despite their despicable owner/ceo’s practices, because the community that had grown up there is the supreme value of that network. both blossomed under the realization of the value of staying in touch and speaking our minds, and even building movement strength (even discovering those movements we might not have even continue reading

brian zahnd – the primary problem with american evangelicalism is… | facebook



posted on february 4, 2025  by  theoblogical 


amen: “the primary problem with american evangelicalism is not that it is too evangelical, but that it is far too american. the american tail is wagging the evangelical dog. the values and aspirations of the american empire are given religious sanction in the evangelical church. this the very opposite of what it means to be a prophetic people.

just posted this in comments to the drivel “resolution” offered up by the house and posted (in horror) by steve milloy: “the full counsel of biblical teaching” is code for the inserting of nationalism/maga b.s. common in circles and churches calling themselves “bible-believing”. they are, in reality, the appropriators of the bible; they are “court prophets” echoing the assent of continue reading

no, this is trump's attempt to exercise absolute power and destroy separation of powers and the constitution. this is totalitarianism in front of your nose, #brokenpost. see it. say it.

i can’t help but ask this, after reading his post below: we saw him in 2016 and before, being a fraudster and a shallow, self-absorbed rich snob, and a bigot. we saw him as potus, inept and unfit, and the dangers such a narcissist idiot could unleash. we saw him on jan.6, 2021 and throughout the post election of 2020. continue reading

i’m thinking this morning about finding a way to host a “online support community” on the ecological crisis that runs during all my “waking hours”. preferably, something that “sleeps” when nothing is happening, but wakes and notifies me when someone shows up to talk or even “be a fly on the wall” (to which they could be pre-emptively notified as continue reading

unfortunately, only the people who can afford that level of cable package. i would want to access her thoughts, but cannot. too stretched. and tired of the media’s lack of modernizing away from traditional subs models. we, foolishly, expected this soon after the internet. and news should be reaching out to “the people”. instead, they just jump on the bandwagon continue reading
