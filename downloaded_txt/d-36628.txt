mf doom – dragon’s blood resin
grover washington – mister magic (signal version)
pharoah sanders – the creator has a master plan
buddha brand – funky methodist instrumental
kenny dope – the unreleased project
greyboy allstars – left coast boogaloo
roy ayers – searching
rjd2 – clean living
dam funk – (my funk goes) on & on
dwight tribble & the life force trio – equipoise (sara remix)
kubota toshinobu – dance if you want it
de la soul – saturday
the quantic soul orchestra – pushin’ on featuring alice russell
the poets of rhythm – smilin’ (while you’re crying)
madlib – montara
if you’re too broke to buy your dad a present, try sitting down and listening to this with him. get him like a snickers or something also, though, so even if he hates it, at least he got some candy out of the deal.
if your dad isn’t around, find someone that acts like a dad and listen to it with them. or just listen by yourself.

interlude: chester gregory – high love (freddie joachim remix)
neutral milk hotel – king of carrot flowers part 2
diplo – about that life feat. jahan lennon
king britt & sister gertrude – new world in my view
yo, salve  so i know that like 98% of bad things in this world, like wars and racism and sexism and stuff are all done in god’s name, but on the other hand, lots of people made some pretty cool music about jesus. also he was black, which should count for something.
so yeah, i thought that since it’s christmas or whatever, i would make a christmas tape. swag jesus out and stuff.
have a sunny christmas. go out and skate, do something good for somebody, tell somebody you like them.
shout out to all my atheists though.
