the old corral website is a research project in progress and dedicated to those wonderful cowboy heroes, heroines, sidekicks, heavies, and supporting players that rode the silver screen from the 1930s through the early 1950s in b westerns and cowboy cliffhangers. my goal is to simply rekindle memories of those great silver screen adventures, and provide information, critique, and education on the actors, actresses and films of the genre. as the old corral has expanded, it has been recognized as a comprehensive history and ongoing study of the b western, the western film performers, and the production companies and personnel.
