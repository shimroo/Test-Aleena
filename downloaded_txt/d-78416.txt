welcome to the penny arcade! here you will find many
images of various early coin operated penny arcade games from my collection.
i am particularly interested in the game of pinball. there are pictures of
many historic 'first' machines which document the evolution of pinball from the
billiards like game of bagatelle into what we know today as 'pinball'. the
site may be accessed as:www.pinballhistory.com,  www.pinballmuseum.com
