online golf club fitting 

		if you are a serious golfer, you have at least considered the idea of going through a custom club fitting process in order to optimize your equipment. the equipment you use has a big influence over the kinds of shots you are able to hit on the course, so even making minor improvements to your gear could turn into dramatic changes on the score card. it won’t actually take that much time or effort to get custom fit for golf clubs, and the results have potential to change your game.

		as you may already know, there is an incredible amount of technology that has been put into the club fitting business in recent years. hi-tech computer equipment is used to measure every aspect of the golfer’s swing, and the results can be rather impressive. most of the players on the top golf tours around the world spend a considerable amount of time working on equipment fitting because it can play such a big role in the outcome of a tournament. golf is a hard enough game as it is, so there is no sense in making it harder by playing with equipment that is ill-matched to your swing.

		of course, the clubs that are in your bag are never going to hit the shots for you. the most important aspect of the game will always be the swing that you are able to make, but your equipment can help you get the most out of that swing. think about it this way – your swing makes up something like 90% of the shots that you hit, while equipment takes care of that last 10%. so, while the swing is always going to be more important, there is no reason not to optimize the last 10% to the best of your ability. spend time working through a club fitting and you will find the game feels just a little bit easier when you have full trust in each of your clubs.

		while an in-person club fitting is the most popular option for fine-tuning a set of clubs, there is also the possibility of going through an online process instead. obviously, you can’t hit balls or talk directly to the club fitter when using an online tool, but it can still provide you with valuable information. there are a number of variables that will dictate what kind of gear you should be using, and much of the information dictating those variables can be captured over the internet. if you don’t have the time to go through the process of an in-person club fitting, or if you would just prefer the convenience that comes with doing things online, this may be the right choice for you. in the end, the only thing that matters is getting the right club in your hands so you can perform to the best of your ability.
