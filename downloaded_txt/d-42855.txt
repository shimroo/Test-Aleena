            february 2025    

happy valentine's & president's day! with all the sweeping changes being made by our new u.s.a. president, i'd like to suggest he change st. valentine's day of erotic love to st. john's day of divine love. i know it wouldn't be politically popular, but it's a nice thought since knowing god's love empowers us to be loved and to love. the apostle john wrote:

"beloved, let us love one another, for love is of god; and everyone who loves is born of god and knows god. he who does not love does not know god, for god is love" (1 john 4:7-8, nkjv).

 christianity for fools 
christianity seems foolish based on the world's priorities. yet, eternal salvation is more valuable than hall of fame, wealth and success pursued by the world. our prayer is that this book will open your eyes to an entirely new vision for life.
