we support hchs, advocates, and consumer leaders through webinars, courses, regional and national training, conferences, as well as by providing technical support and access to experts in the health care for the homeless field. our clinical team works to continually improve standards of care and help in training hch staff.





our research team finds and collects data from various regional and national sources, often working with governmental bodies and private organizations. we offer these up for free by using dashboards, publications, and live as well as recorded presentations.
















our advocacy team works with political leaders to help effect change nationally and regionally and produces material to support activists in the fight to end homelessness and improve medical care to those who are experiencing homelessness.
