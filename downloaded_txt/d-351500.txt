 remember this call, because you're going to study him in school."at the beginning of this school year, my wife and i went to curriculum night at r.'s school.  that is the night where we get to meet all the teachers and learn what the kids will be learning.  in r.'s english class, the teacher saw me looking at a poster of the cover to fahrenheit 451 and as we got up to leave she commented, "r. said ray bradbury called your house."  the way she said it made it sound like she thought r. was stretching the truth, but we confirmed the call took place. and inside i thought, "wow!  she really does listen to what i say!"at the end of the year, r. was assigned to read bradbury's story "the veldt" in class.  after reading it, she asked if i had ever read it and i told her i had, and i also provided her with an audiotape of bradbury reading the story himself.there's not much more to say.  i was lucky enough to have a few encounters with ray bradbury one-on-one. and i can encounter him any time i was by pulling any of a number of collections and novels from my bookshelves and reading his words.(1 comment | leave a comment)may. 2nd, 201212:50 pm - story published: in the shadow of broadwaymy short story, "in the shadow of broadway" appears in the current episode of the podcast starshipsofa.(leave a comment)09:39 am - celebrating ten years of newsten years ago today, i began posting the news over on sf site. not sure how many stories i've reported in those ten years, but it is at least several thousand.to commemorate the anniversary, i've reposted the news from may 2, 2002, which included the announcement of the launch of 3sf, plans to reopen andromeda bookstore, david truesdale's resignation at the editor of the sfwa bulletin, sfwa election results and nebula winners, and obituaries for henry slesar, jon gustafson, damon knight, joan harrison, george alec effinger, and richard cowper.(2 comments | leave a comment)apr. 11th, 201209:26 am - golden bearon march 29, a local restaurant, woodfire chicken, closed, in part, perhaps even in large part, due to on-going construction on lake-cook road.  we've been going to the restaurant for years, although usually my family refers to it by a different name, which really annoys elaine, since it is a name that hasn't been on the restaurant since 1984.sometime in the late 1960s or early 1970s, the building the restaurant stood in was built to house a golden bear pancake house.  this was a chain of 17 restaurants (there is another one in niles, currently occupied by goodi's reastaurant) based out of mount prospect and founded in 1961.  in 1973, the chain was bought by montgomery ward's, which was bought by mobil oil a year later.  although golden bear was mostly a breakfast restaurant, they also served lunch and dinner.  their napkins included the words to a jingle, "golden bear, golden bear, it’s a honey of a place where food is fun," along with a picture of their mascot (a golden bear with a stack of pancakes, clever, right?).in 1984, mobil divested themselves of golden bear by selling the chain, then 45 restaurants strong, to pizza hut, because that's just what chicago needs, more chain pizza parlors.  even in 1984 when the restaurant rebranded itself, i wondered why i would want to buy a chain pizza when i could easily get pizza from nancy's, or jake's, or any of numerous other local pizzerias that actually serve one of the three varieties of chicago pizza. (good, better, and best, for those keeping track).*i'm not sure how long the pizza hut existed on lake cook road.  it is the only incarnation of that building i didn't frequent.  eventually, they closed and reopened as full slab ribs, which my family always referred to as "that restaurant, where golden bear used to be."  the owners eventually decided to expand their menu and changed the name to "woodfire chicken," which was always simply "let's go to golden bear."**and now it is a vacant building again.  according to the landlord, there are two (unnamed) restaurants interested in moving into the spot.  i hope one of them does. i hope it is a locally owned place.  and i know that when it opens, i'll refer to it as golden bear.*pizza hut converted the golden bears, just as they did to the sambo's restaurants they had also acquired.**elaine is also annoyed that i refer to baker's square, where i used to work, as poppin' fresh pies, even though the name changed before i worked there.  and the aon building, which is her company, although she doesn't work in the building, as the standard oil building or big stan.  i don't like name changes.(5 comments | leave a comment)feb. 8th, 201207:14 am - capricon starts tomorrow: my scheduletomorrow is the beginning of the four days of capricon, where i will be one of the guests of honor.  below is my schedule, or where to find me.  in addition, my daughters will be selling girl scout cookies on saturday afternoon.trivia for chocolate - thursday, 02-09-2012 - 6:30 pm to 8:00 pm - ravinia b (teen lounge)what it says on the tin. the traditional steven h silver trivia contest. answer trivia questions correctly, get chocolate. the person with the most chocolate on hand at the end wins!
