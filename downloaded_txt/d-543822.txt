third estate sunday review



the third estate sunday review focuses on politics and culture.  we're an online magazine.  we don't play nice and we don't kiss butt.  in the words of tuesday weld: "i do not ever want to be a huge star. do you think i want a success? i refused "bonnie and clyde" because i was nursing at the time but also because deep down i knew that it was going to be a huge success. the same was true of "bob and carol and fred and sue" or whatever it was called. it reeked of success."

truest statement of the week 





the muskenjugend — the mostly very young people musk has hired to 
work at the department of government efficiency, which isn’t actually a 
government department in any legal sense but which trump has effectively
 given huge and probably unconstitutional power to remake federal 
agencies — generally seem to share three characteristics.first,
 they all seem to be extreme right-wing ideologues: whenever journalists
 investigate the social media trail of one of musk’s operatives, what 
they find is horrifying. for example, marko elez, who had access to the 
treasury department’s central payments system, had in the recent past advocated racism and eugenics.second,
 they don’t know anything about the government agencies they’re 
supposedly going to make more efficient. that’s understandable. the 
federal government has around 2 million workers, many — i would say the 
vast majority — performing important public services, in a huge variety 
of fields. you can’t parachute into a government agency and expect to 
know in a matter of days which if any programs and employees are 
dispensable.but the third characteristic of the muskenjugend is that, like musk himself, they’re arrogant. they believe that they can parachute into agencies and quickly identify what should be cut.so last week, when the trump administration began laying off large numbers of probationary workers,
 the only real questions were how quickly it would become clear that 
essential government functions were being compromised and just how scary
 the damage would be.-- paul krugman, "our government is experiencing a rapid unscheduled disassembly" (substack).

editorial: congress needs to do its job and we need to do our job





socialists like kyle kulinski and jake johnson are 
attacking democrats.  that's what socialists do.  they're not 
democrats.  the ones in political closets never attack their own -- 
hell, as eoin higgins demonstrates, they don't even hold their own 
accountable.  (see ava and c.i.'s "media: owned finds eoin higgins owned by bad journalism" and not that sam seder is now 
pimping eoin which probably tells you something about sam if you stop 
and think.) we hate to 
break it to the idiots and liars and con artists of dsa but they need to
 stop playing jill stein and blaming the democrats exclusively.are republicans not members of congress?we're not hearing about them from the laughable moveon -- walkon, walkon.org,  why is that?matt laslo (raw story) points out:in
 the month since trump took his oath of office, critics say, instead of 
standing up for congress and flexing the new powers the supreme court 
bestowed on the institution, congressional republicans have all but 
surrendered their oversight responsibilities as they’ve ceded 
unprecedented power to president donald trump and his billionaire 
sidekick, elon musk.guess what?  if you live in texas and are a democrat?  you still have two us senators -- john cornyn and ted cruz.idiots are saying, "make demands on democrats."  sure, do that.  but don't be a fool like jill stein.if
 democrats in maine -- a number who vote for susan collins -- had 
pressured her on tulsi gabbard, she might not have voted to confirm her.equally
 true, you're a constituent.  they don't need to know anything else.  
they don't need to know your party i.d.  they're supposed to represent 
you.right now, republicans
 control the house and the senate.  if it our job, as citizens, to make 
sure that our representatives in congress -- regardless of political 
party -- know where we stand.let
 kyle and cenk focus on creating a new collective of justice 
socialists.  let us focus on the real world and demand that members of 
congress, regardless of party i.d., represent us, the constituents.  we 
are their boss. let's start acting like it.

media: thrillers and spoilers





chump in the white house?  only 28 days since the second inauguration, as chelsea handler might say, so why does it seem like we're already in season  nineteen of scandal?  when he's not bellowing and bullying, donald chump's circumventing the law or outright breaking it.you could argue he's rendered the thriller genre of entertainment unneeded.  and yet apple tv+ and hulu have both started airing strong and fresh thrillers.spoiler: prime target is strong show that avoids the 
problems of the night agent by making the character of the male lead gay
 or bisexual.  the night agent returned for a less than inspiring season
 two.  the biggest problem?  though a significant amount of time has 
passed since season one, the two leads -- who we rooted for as a couple 
-- have to reconnect.  leo woodall plays edward brooks, a grad student, 
who studies numbers and is developing a possible cypher that would act 
as a decoder for all computer workings.  taylah (quintessa swidnell) is a
 us spy.  she is one of the agents monitoring the uk based college 
edward attends.  spoiler: as ed and taylah will both learn, don't trust 
your mentor.trust really is the key issue for prime target.reminds us of jill stein, the con artist embraced by the green party again in 2024.six.  and six.what are those numbers?the first is the number of videos green party 2020 presidential candidate howie hawkins has done since the 2024 election.six is also the number of videos howie did in the equivalent period following the 2020 election.spoiler:  zero.that's the number of videos jill stein has created since the election.  it's also the number of videos she has ever created.she
 was the green party's candidate in the 2012 presidential election.  and
 again in 2016.  then last year as well.  she never does anything to 
build the party. when
 zac and gavin regularly attacked howie hawkins in 2023 and during most 
of 2024, we tried to remind ourselves that the vanguard boys are 
children.  they'd slam him over and over.  and they weren't the only 
ones.we'd marvel over that
 because howie is the only green party candidate who didn't disappear 
after an election.  howie spent 2020 through this week trying to build 
the green party.ralph 
nader didn't do that.  he didn't even run with them for his 2004 and 
2008 presidential runs.  cynthia mckinney barely got a goodbye uttered 
before she left the party.  jill stein doesn't believe in building or 
giving back which is why she flitted all over the place like some giant 
gypsy moth instead of rolling up her sleeves and working on building the
 green party.following the
 2016 elections, jill insisted donald chump had stolen the election and 
insisted that she, as a presidential candidate, could bring legal 
challenges.  the problem, she insisted, was that she didn't have the 
money to do so.  she
 raised over seven million dollars for this recount that wasn't and 
she's never been able to explain where over a million dollars of it went. 
 that same run, 2016, is when the country learned that jill actually 
invested in many companies that didn't meet green standards nor green 
party standards -- among other industries, jill profited from the 
defense industry.  that should have been enough to end any future runs for president on a green party ticket.but
 jill is a vengeful failure.  too lazy to do what howie hawkins did 
following his 2020 run, she never the less loathed the attention that 
the videos and the column writing garnered him and the party after his 
run.  she teamed with green party gadfly and serial plagiarist chris hedges to rig the 2024 green party primary.rigged?circumvent. chris
 had created cornel west's campaign for president on the people's party 
ticket -- a detail he left out when 'reporting' on cornel's campaign.  
he left so much out of 'reporting.'  but that imploded so he and jill 
cooked up a scam to make cornel the green party's presidential 
candidate.  old readers know this already but for any new readers, we 
were the only ones on the left covering this garbage and telling you the
 truth.  aaron mate?  katie halper?  go down the list.  they lied to you
 over and over and told you, in spring 2023, that cornel was now the 
green party's presidential nominee.  they said it over and over on 
youtube as only worthless garbage liars can. it
 was left to us to note that (a) the green party would select their 
nominee in the summer of 2024 at their national convention and that (b) 
grassroots greens were responding with "hell no" to the notion that the 
green party would throw away the rules to gift anyone with the 
nomination.  gifting with the nomination.can
 we go down a sidestreet for just a moment?  hillary robbed bernie in 
2016!!!!  that was the cry of the vanguard boyz and jimmy dore and so 
many others.  we never understood that cry because we're apparently 
highly allergic to hypocrisy.  please grasp that jimmy, gavin and zac 
and so many others kept trashing howie hawkins in 2023 and 2024 as they 
argued that the green party nominee in 2020 should have been jesse 
ventura.  did jesse run for the nomination?  no.  he did say if they gave it to him, he'd accept it.how kind of him.don't
 whine that you think bernie was treated unfairly in 2016 while you also
 argue that the green party should disregard its rules and gift the 
presidential nomination to jesse ventura. back to the main road, jill stein is a huckster, a grifter.  she lied to cornel and stabbed him the back.  then she was surprised that he would call her out publicly.nothing that desperate and craven failure does should ever surprise anyone.  spoiler:
 she got the nomination and spent the entire campaign trashing kamala 
harris.  amy goodman (and juan gonzalez) never asked her for proof when 
she played the martyr insisting means dems were trying to stop her.  
they also let her attack -- amy even joined in the attacks -- kamala 
while she refused to attack donald chump.  it took a real journalist 
interviewing her, mehdia hasan, to note that she attacked kamala but not
 chump and that she stood no chance of winning and had never held public
 office and had no actual solutions or plans if an act of god left her 
the only candidate standing and therefore the winner.what should be the end of her sad tale took place last week when republicans against trump reposted
 jill's campaign manager jason call revealing, after the election, that 
jill's goal was always to elect donald chump because "electing harris 
would have been worse. [. . .] as godawful as trump is, it was the 
better outcome."  he now expects the left to work with and "organize" 
and work on "ending capitalism."   he failed two times running for 
congress as a democrat.  in 2024, he switched to green out of anger at 
the pathetic way his life turned out.  he ran again for congress, as a 
green this time, and lost again.  spoiler: losers like jill stein 
attract other losers.  spoiler: in prime target, the role of jill stein 
is played (brilliantly) by martha plimpton. the
 other thriller worth catching these days is on hulu.  paradise, like 
prime target, serves up a new episode each week. prime target works out 
like that very well.  paradise?  we're burnt out on binge but this is a 
show that could have dumped all the episodes at once and we would have 
binged it.  it stars sterling k. brown delivering the best performance 
we've seen since the new season started last september.  he is a a 
recent widow (as far as we know) and father of two.  spoiler: he blames 
the president for his wife's death. that would be president cal bradford
 (well played by james marsden) and sterling's agent xavier collins 
heads up cal's security detail.  julianne nicholson, jon beavers and 
sarah shahi deliver strong performances as well and each episode leaves 
you reeling.  spoiler:  an
 event is said to wipe out the rest of the earth.  ahead of the event, a
 city is built inside a mountain where those selected to live now 
reside.among other topics, the series deals with treachery, free will and plato's noble lie.what it mainly does is end any belief you might have had in conspiracies.spoiler: there are no hidden hands controlling presidents in real life.barack
 obama was beginning his second term when we had a knock down blow out 
fight with media dissector danny schechter.  we had a very public 
disagreement with him following the death of ike turner and danny's 
public stating that tina turner had to forgive ike.  had to?  we have to
 forgive a terrorist?  tina was a grown ass woman and didn't need anyone
 telling her what to do, for starters.  second, ike was a terrorist who 
beat her.  that's what domestic abuse is: terrorism.  that's why 
survivors can end up with post-traumatic stress.  it changes their lives
 but, if they're lucky, they survive.  danny
 got very bent out of shape offline when we made very clear that not 
only did tina not have to forgive him but she didn't.  we both knew 
tina.  on a friends basis.  danny interviewed her back in the 80s and 
seemed to think that one interview allowed him to dictate her life.we
 went round and round on that -- phone calls, e-mails, even a 
face-to-face.  danny thought for sure he could force us to agree with 
him. he couldn't force us to agree with him anymore than he could force 
tina to forgive the terrorist.that disagreement, again, was carried out very publicly.the barack one, not so much.  both sides got digs in -- passing blows -- from time to time.but even danny had to finally agree with us.danny
 was a true blue barack believer.  he misjudged barack's political 
identity and didn't want to own that -- both in terms of what obama 
really stood for and what it said about danny that he got barack so 
wrong.he was insisting -- to us and at his blog the news dissector -- that barack wanted to do this and to do that but couldn't.because of congress?we could have agreed with him that congress wasn't as supportive of barack as it could have been.but,
 no, danny was offering nonsense, conspiracy nonsense.  barack wanted to
 do all the things danny believed in; however, he would be killed by the
 government if he did.if elements of the government murdered jfk, we wouldn't be at all surprised. but
 danny wasn't fretting over the iraq war (once barack got sworn in, 
danny lost all interest in the iraq war).  no, danny was talking about 
domestic items.  the government, danny insisted, would kill barack.and so, danny insisted, barack couldn't act and barack knew this.seemed
 like a cop out to us.  you invested way too much meaning and trust and 
love into a candidate.  we don't fall in love with politicians, we're 
not that pathetic.  we've said that for many years hear.  we believe we 
started saying it when danny -- a very smart person -- could no longer 
handle reality because of his crush on obama.spoiler: no one's controlling our presidents.donald
 chump is attacking the fbi and the cia currently.  he attacked them 
during his first term as well.  donald continues to breathe.  if our 
government was controlled, that would not be the case.  if the cia or 
some 'hidden' government agency ran everything, donald chump would not 
have gotten back into the white house.spoiler: our problems are our own creation and not the result of some hidden control over our government. be
 great if we could pin the blame on others.  be great if we had a noble 
barack or, in paradise's case, cal who wanted so badly to do the right 
thing and to tell us the truth.  but these people lived under threat 
even as they occupied the oval office.  spoiler:
 if the cia controlled the president, they would have settled donald 
chump's ass down in his first term and there would have been no 
re-election.conspiracy 
theories are a cop out that excuses we the people from taking actual 
control and responsibility for the world we live in.  it allows us to 
instead wallow in planned helplessness.

books (stan, ava and c.i.)






 as
 we did in 2021 and 2023 and 2024, we're attempting to again increase book coverage in the
 community. this go round, we're talking with stan about his "sly's awful books proves questlove a liar."  sly is sly stone of sly & the family stone -- a late sixties and early seventies group that had a string of hits.  you didn't like the book?stan:
 not at all.  and i'm really mad at questlove because he just did a 
'documentary' on sly stone.  and that was nothing but garbage.  you noted that he was a good songwriter until --stan:
 until the drugs destroyed everything.  everything since 1975 onward has
 been garbage.  and no one forced him to do drugs.  be honest about what
 you are and what you do.  take responsibility.  in fact, that's why i 
really loathe sly.  he was an awful father.  he's so old and so f-ed up 
that he thinks he can talk around it.  no, you damn bastard, you had 
kids, pay the child support.  deadbeat dad.  you might have been cute as
 late as the 80s but too many mothers and children have had to suffer --
 especially black mothers and black children.  pay your damn child 
support.  it's not cute, it's not funny.  at one time, he's talking to a
 son and whining about how he wished, now that he was an adult, he had 
money to give him but he doesn't.  whine, whine, whine.  reality, he 
made at least 80,000 a year on royalties -- especially songwriting.  he 
could have paid child support.  he chose to be a drug addict for his 
entire life.  he got 'clean' in 2019.  about five years ago.  he waited 
until the age of 76 to get clean.  he's disgusting and pimping women to 
ike turner so ike would give him drugs? he's disgusting.  jimi, janis 
and jim didn't pimp people for their drugs.  he's just a manipulator and
 that's what comes through in his own book, what a liar he is and how 
much he hurts people. the book really made you not like him?stan:
 and grasp what a liar questlove is.  this book came out in 2023.  sly's
 lucky nobody read it.  otherwise he might have been at the inauguration
 last month.  he's a trumper.  he talks about that in the book.  sly 
stone is a fan of convicted felon donald chump.  grasp that.  grasp that
 questlove knew that and still made that awful 'documentary.'  sly stone
 was good for about eight years of his career in terms of writing songs 
and making music.  he was a disgusting father.  he was a drug addict of 
many, many decades.  he wasn't very good with the women in his life -- 
and they had to be mixed, by the way.  and on top of all that, he's a 
trumper.  no.  done with you.  you mean nothing to me now, less than 
nothing.  a black man who is a trumper?  oh, hell no.  go sleep with 
some more non-black women and see if that helps stop your self-loathing,
 sly stone.do you recommend the book in any manner?stan:
 yes.  if you are reading this and thinking, "sly can't be that bad"?  
yes, he is.  read his 'biography' that he dictated to a co-author. ------------------------------previous book discussions:"books (trina, ava and c.i.)""books (rebecca, marcia, ava and c.i.)"

a united front?





can reporters stick together?  not
 really.  jane pauley proved that long, long ago when everyone of the 
network morning shows were competing on a princess diana interview and 
none of them, including jane, followed the agreed upon ground rules.we
 note that because of jim acosta.  the journalist is rightly offended 
that the white house is attempting to bully the outlet into calling the 
gulf of mexico by another name. yasmeen hamadeh (the daily beast) explains:former cnn anchor jim acosta has
 called for reporters and news outlets to band together against the 
trump administration’s treatment of journalists, after it blacklisted an
 associated press reporter from white house briefings earlier this week 
for refusing to call the “gulf of mexico” by its new trump-appointed 
name.“it
 is crucial for news outlets to unite in opposition to any attempts by 
the administration to harm individual journalists and their 
organizations,” acosta wrote on his substack, the jim acosta show, sunday.“news
 organizations in washington should be banding together to send the 
message that members of the press will determine how they cover the 
news,” acosta continued. “not the white house. not the man behind the 
resolute desk, no matter how he redraws the world’s maps. the 
presidential sharpie is not mightier than the pen.”tommy christopher (mediaite) adds:he
 added “it’s only the gulf of america if you surrender yourself to 
trump’s warped imagination,” calling it “goofy” and “nutty.”“the
 dispute is over whether we’re going to just surrender ourself to the 
warped imagination of the man in the oval office. we are just not going 
to do that,” acosta concluded.on monday morning, acosta dropped a lengthy commentary urging
 media outlets and reporters to do more, and comparing the situation to 
his own case against trump. in 2018. the then-first-term president lost a court battle when his administration tried to ban acosta from the white house briefing room.we think jim acosta is making a great call.  we just think the group he's appealing to doesn't have a great deal of self-respect or committment.

about me




third estate sunday review


jim, dona, jess, ty, "ava" started out this site as five students enrolled in journalism in ny.  now?  we're still students.  we're in ca.  journalism?  the majority scoffs at the notion.
from the start, at the very start, c.i. of the common ills has helped with the writing here.  c.i.'s part of our core six/gang.  (c.i. and ava write the tv commentaries by themselves.)  so that's the six of us.  we also credit dallas as our link locator, soundboard and much more.  we try to remember to thank him each week (don't always remember to note it here) but we'll note him in this.  so this is a site by the gang/core six: jim, dona, ty, jess, ava and c.i. (of the common ills).
