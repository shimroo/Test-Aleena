"mr. martin a. kron & associates is very professional, direct, and responsive."
mr. kron and his firm delivered results way beyond my expectations. job well done and worth the money!!


elie





"i walked out with my best possible outcome."
after receiving a ticket for driving in a construction zone, i reached out to marty who was highly recommended to me. marty was terrific and clearly laid out all the possible scenarios. sometimes court can be overwhelming (points, no points, fine, reduced fine, guilty vs not guilty) yet marty made everything simple and focused on what outcome was most important for me. due to marty, i walked in confident and walked out with my best possible outcomei hope to not be in court again for any type of traffic violation but marty will be my first call if i need assistance and anyone else reading this should do the same.


justin





"i will never deal with another attorney again."
i experienced a very difficult situation between the states of new york as well as new jersey where i was potentially facing a 6-month suspension of my license. aside from the fact that i live 6 hours from new jersey, i was in dire need of professional expertise to ensure that my situation was handled as well as possible. i spoke with a number of attorney's and decided to hire martin; and will never deal with another attorney again. martin was extremely friendly, offered great advice and support and ultimately helped me to have all of the charges thrown out with my case being dropped.as we all know, no one can promise or guarantee the same outcome. however, if you want the best chance to receive the best possible outcome, martin kron and his team are your only option.


matt





"i would refer him to anyone, anytime for anything."
i had 3 cell phone violations within 18 months, which by law subjects me to license suspension. mr. kron and i deferred our case 4 times which is the maximum. when we finally decided to plead me guilty, mr. kron did everything within his power to reason with the judge for leniency-and he succeeded!! i was found guilty, have to pay a fine, but will be able to keep on driving which is extremely important for me to maintain my lifestyle. most importantly, during this process, i was a nervous wreck. mr. kron was immediate in his responses to my inquiries----almost replying to my texts before i hit send!! i cannot thank this man enough... i would refer him to anyone, anytime for anything. he did an absolutely wonderful job for me. one final thought. you know how you read about or see about everything else that works for other people but never works for you? this is a case where this guy was an angel and delivered me the best possible outcome. i am a very lucky man today because of mr. kron.


brian





"got me a great outcome!!"
just found out that my careless driving and my 10 over speed were both dismissed! i was freaked out since i drive commercially and can't have points on my license! i am so happy that the lawyers at mak were able to take my case and get me a great outcome!!!!! in the past i hired another traffic attorney and all he did was take my money and i still got found guilty. martin cost a little more but he was well worth it cuz we won!


guillermo





"if you need an ace in the hole, he's your man!"
mr. kron was on top of my case like an eagle in the treetops and kept me informed the entire time of every change as well as every possible outcome. his attention to detail, professionalism, and demeanor is unmatched.


spiro





"exceeds excellence!!"
the team at martin a. kron exceeds excellence!!! thank you so much, naomi, for helping me in my situation concerning my dmv case! you're the best!!!


viana





"martin was honest, clear and available."
this was my first time hiring an attorney for a ticket. i had a ticket for speeding in a school zone and was in jeopardy of having my license suspended. martin was honest, clear and available. he just communicated with me and shared i was found not guilty!!! so grateful and thankful for martin and his team!
