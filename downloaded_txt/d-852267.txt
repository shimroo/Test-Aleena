the cheddi jagan research centre (cjrc) was officially opened on march 22, 2000 which was the 82nd birthday  anniversary of dr. cheddi jagan. the cjrc is dedicated to making available to guyana and the world, the very  rich collection of materials which captures the visionary thoughts and revolutionary ideas of the late president of  guyana, dr. cheddi jagan (1918-1997).
the centre houses a large archival collection of papers,  documents, photographs, audio and dvds related to dr. jagan’s long and enduring  involvement in leading the political struggle in guyana and at the global  level. dr. cheddi jagan is the father of the guyanese nation and a renowned and  respected statesman. his immense stature in guyana, the caribbean and the world  at large stems from his ground-breaking contributions in numerous stages of the  struggle for a better life for the people of guyana and the world at large.  these include:
 1. the struggle against the british to end colonial rule through  political independence. 
2. governing for the benefit of the guyanese people in  the colonial period in 1953 and 1957 to 1964 and as the 1st democratically  elected president of independent guyana from 1992-1997 and mrs. jagan's presidency 1997-1999.
3. the international  struggle for an end to poverty and inequality through a new global human order.
 the cjrc’s aims and objectives are to publish material and promote research on  the life, work and ideas of dr. and mrs. jagan which is intertwined with the history of  guyana as a whole from the early 1940’s to the late 1990’s. moreover, the  collection is indispensable to any analysis of guyana’s post-war social,  economic and political development, since their work and thoughts have  had such a powerful resonance with his country and beyond. 
welcome to our website dedicated to the life and work of cheddi and janet  jagan.
the year was 1918, when on march 22,  in a rural village in guyana, the remarkable life of an ordinary sugar worker's  son began. his name was cheddi jagan, and before his time was over he would  change the course of his country's history by first struggling to liberate it  from british colonial domination, then by waging a 28 year long struggle for  the restoration of freedom and democracy, and finally by ascending to the  presidency as guyana's first democratically elected head of state.
alongside dr. jagan in all these  struggles was his american born wife, lifelong friend and political partner,  janet, who left the usa for life in guyana where she remained until her death  on march 28, 2009. she was a woman of a number of firsts in her long history of  involvement in her adopted country's politics. she was to reach the pinnacle as  first woman head of state in december 1997, following the death in office of  her husband on march 6, after first serving as prime minister.
they were the founders of the  country's first mass political movement and unquestionably the leading  political figures in the history of guyana for over the last 70 years. through  their tireless efforts, the small country of guyana experienced a wealth of  benefits, social advancement and economic prosperity.
 as international figures they are  well known for their fight for peace and freedom around the globe. dr. jagan's  ideas on debt relief, as well as his proposals for a new global human order,  were adopted by the united nations general assembly on november 14, 2002. as  such, he deserves credit as a major figure in modern history.
