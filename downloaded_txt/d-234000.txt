patients testimonials








 

 my daughter was suffering from vitiligo since 1 year. we had taken many treatments of homeopathy and allopathy, but no treatment could cure this disease. when we came to life force, we came to a positive way of life! the vitiligo patches dissappeared in just 2 months of treatment!! its unbelievable to us. i feel so fortunate that we got life force and we can now direct other patients to life force. i am very thankful to god for getting treatment from life force. thanks a lot dr shah.  d. b., mother of r. b., india  i, mr. mangesh tukrul residing in mumbai. before taking treatment i was suffering from one sided headache. the pain was extremely severe. i was not able to see light or hear noise due to intense pain. one day my manager suggested me to visit life force and discuss your headache with the doctor. 
today i thank him as well as life force as since i had started medicine, i have not experienced the same pain on any single day till today.  mangesh tukrul, india.  i, g.b.b. pin: 18295, was suffering from lichen planopilaris confirmed by biopsy since september 2009 (about two years ago). the first spot which appeared was like a circle, about 4 centimeters in diameter; the second spot which was close to the first one was about 3 centimeters in diameters (not perfect circles, more irregular than circles). these spots started on the scalp, first one spot in the september of 2009, which calmed down after 3 months of treatment (conventional treatment: plaquenil and kenalog spray) and then in august/september 2010, the first spot reappeared and then i developed the second spot. i had moderate to mild itching associated with the red spots and some emotional stress since childhood. in october 2010, i approached life force center, dr rajesh shah’s clinic. my case details were taken online and i was made to fill a questionnaire regarding my medical details and my life stresses. after starting the treatment, i was prescribed 4 months of medicines. by the completion of 4 months, on 28 january 2011, i had responded great. i was able to stop all steroids within 2 weeks of starting treatment. all the itching and burning and inflammation had stopped. my hair started re-growing little by little. i’d say there was around 60% improvement. i was prescribed the next set of medicines for 4 months. my progress report of 13 june 2011 i had great improvement. i would say 100% - no symptoms, although not all my hair has come back.  g.b.b. , usa
