why choose rv travel?







avoid crowds
on a family vacation, airports and hotels can be stressful and expensive. combine your transportation and lodging all in one.





set your pace
prefer a faster or slower paced vacation? you dictate the pace of your rv adventure.





stock up
you can pack more supplies in an rv than a suitcase, including food in a full kitchen.





explore the unknown
some things can’t be seen unless you’re on a road trip. ever been to bishop’s castle?

    staff were very friendly, efficient and accommodating. quick check out and check in. rv was nice and clean inside. the only negative part of our experience was that our batteries died during the first night of our trip, which meant our fridge died and we woke up to all our frozen food, defrosted. we were in rocky mountain national park, and were about 20min from the closest napa auto parts (but thankful the b&b staff were helpful finding the closest place to replace the batteries). so thankfully not too far, but the hassle of packing up and cutting our hiking day short the next day so we could drive to napa, was inconvenient. and our only compensation was being reimbursed for the 2 batteries we had to replace (a little over $400). so not the best experience, but, ok.

updated: staff reached out to us and emailed a form asking how much i wanted to be compensated. they then refunded us for what i asked for. they were quick and responsive.
