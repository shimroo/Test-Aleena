my trip to the land of cheese


jul. 11th, 2007 at 10:20 pm



 


amf_3so yeh.  jace has come to columbus like, a billion times so i finally set aside two weeks for me to come over.so..i landed in midway (chicago) which getting out of was a nightmare in itself.  we had to drive through the southside of chicago... which isn't pretty to begin with... and then make the hour and a half journey to milwaukee, where we stayed w/ rj.milwaukee was one of the highlights of the trip.  we went to this liquor store that had beer as far as the eye could see.  basically every city in wisconsin has at least one of their own breweries.  then the lax tourny..so i played with basically the only kids from wisconsin who went somewhere for college, or were just baller in general.  we easily beat the first team like 15-5 and i scored a goal off of the faceoff.  i just pushed it forward, scooped it up, split dodge from left to right then fired stick side-hip.  hit the goalie's stick and went in.  i think that was like, my fifth goal ever outside of practice?second game was probably more fun, because these guys thought they were the shit.  i almost got in a fight with a guy who had an inferiority complex after his shit-talking did nothing to me.  on the faceoff, just to be an asshole i'd try to break his wrists by just jamming him.  then if he was guarding me or vice-versa i just poke checked him with my metal butt end in the ribs or stomach then got away before he could do anything, haha.  we won like 13-4.third game was ultimate bullshit.  it was the championship game and we had perhaps the worst ref in the history of lacrosse.  now, i had heard stories from brad & jace freshman year about how bad this guy was, but i didn't believe the extent of how bad this guy was.  we had two play-on goals turned away by "inadvertant whistle" and we lost by 1.  not only that, but there was 1:35 left in the fourth quarter.  they were called for a 1minute slash, then as soon as the penalty was released.. the game was over.  oh, did i mention that we also had the ball and our best offensive player was driving to the cage?  after the game, i asked the ref's (the head one, specifically) if he knew how to count time and then thanked them for a wonderful championship game.  i also made sure that everyone heard me tell sid he was the worst fucking referee i've ever seen.

so...


jul. 11th, 2007 at 1:43 pm



 


amf_3alright, so i had 8 total posts in 2006, and nearing the middle of july, i have a total of 0 for 2007.  i think i had a billion in 03/04/05 combined.maybe it was just that i felt i grew out of livejournal to blog my thoughts / adventures / emotions, but i'm past that now.  i really want to get back to writing on a consistent basis, thanks to lauren.  i just read like, 4 of hers and felt compelled to get back on here.  she writes really well, even if her stories are a little... erhm, weird to say the least, haha.lacrosse season was great this year.  we wound up losing in the semi-finals of the deep south tourney to wingate (the eventual dsc champs) who we beat in double overtime in the regular season.  ergh.school went well.  i figured out i'm a semester behind due my former advisor incorrectly scheduling classes for me and some of my credits not transferring from north east.  oh well.  graduating in 4 years is like leaving the party at 930.i wouldn't say that i've changed much since i last posted a legit entry, but i'd say i'm definetly much more comfortable in my own skin.  i'm able to really say what i want to who, but i'm more cafeful about how i go around things.  for instance, i'm not gonna publicly say how i feel about a friend's relationship i feel is detrimental to him.  whatever.so, this summer has been a blast.  i've officially had like, 4 jobs i think... lemme list 'em off.1)  a1 lawncare.  i love being outside and getting paid for it.2)  vector marketing.  fuck this job.  anyone who reads this and considers selling knives... you have to really want to sell knives.  i don't, and they constantly blow up my phone (house and cell) wondering where i am.  maybe i'm not answering for a reason, deck!3)  eurotech autos.  let's see... we charge 160$ for a full detail (and it's well worth it if you want that shit spic and span & wax that lasts 6 months) but i made some 50$ for 4 days of work, cleaning and driving cars?  fuck you.4)  auto finance.  one of my dad's dealer friends, i was paid 10$ to wash a car and wound up making 210 dollars for 10 hours.  i work there prolly 2-3 times a week, depending on a fresh batch of cars.

it's been a while


oct. 24th, 2006 at 3:44 am



 


amf_3wow, it's been a long while since i've posted... about 6 months or so.  some major changes in my life.+ jess and i broke up+ i've made many new friends+- i switched from goalie to face-off / defensive midfield- my aunt linda passed away and so did my uncle fran, both from liver cancer.i don't know why i never update this thing anymore.  maybe i feel like it's some sort of thing i let go when i got into college because you saw my posts plummet from somewhere around two times a day to about once every couple of months.  weird.mad props to tonya and ben for getting engaged.

r.i.p grandma burkey 3 - 6 - 06


mar. 7th, 2006 at 12:22 pm



 


amf_3the major source of comfort for me is that i find comforting about my grandmother not being with us anymore is that her battle with cancer is finally over and that she is with god now.  i also take comfort in knowing that i did get to hold her, hug her and kiss her a week and a half ago.  my mother told me that she passed away peacefully this (monday) morning, and i took comfort in knowing that; as i'm sure many of you too here did as well. 	my grandmother was the strongest person i've ever known in my life.  i know that i could not deal with what she's gone through for the greater half of a decade.  i know many people could not go through treatments, being in and out of doctor's offices all the while carrying herself the way she has for the past 7 years since she's had it.	i'm glad to know that i will never have to think about any bad times with my grandma because i don't think i've ever experienced any with her.  i'm positive she's touched everyone's lives in this room the same way she's had an impact on mine; with nothing but love and kindness.  i will never forget when my mom, brother and i lived over in huber ridge.  she would pick us up from school or the after-school programs and take us to revco/cvs for candy every wednesday.  i remember that being the day my brother and i looked forward to the most.  she was also always there for my brother or i when we needed a ride to soccer across town; always there.  i also owe my driving skills (minus any speeding tickers) to my grandmother, as funny as that may seem to some.  	cedar point was easily one of the highlights of just about any summer of mine.  i'd like to believe that it was the highlight of hers as well.  i know she always enjoyed watching me and the rest of the burkey clan go off on the bearenstein bears section, and later on the actual roller coasters.  she was always a trooper, and i don't know of any other woman on the world that could make all of that happen while having to deal with the hassle of the hotel arrangements, dinner reservations, the car ride, the kids, the mosquitoes, the weather, and whatever else was thrown at her way in the way that she could.  my grandmother was just that strong of a person.  just thinking about the way she carried herself now makes me smile.  i just wish she was still here to know that.	i feel so blessed that i was able to spend this past thanksgiving and christmas with her.  anyone can attest to the fact that the room lights up when she walks into it and the food tastes ten times better if she's the one making it.  i know that's where she could shine the brightest because she loved making people happy.  my grandma loved hosting and she was one of the greatest hosts the world of hosting has ever seen.  i don't know of many people besides a handful of family members who were close to her in the way she cooked her famous bbq ribs and to this day don't think anyone will be able to top her lasagna.  thanksgiving and christmas were highlights of the year because i know that's when she was at her happiest.  to this day the two gifts she gave me two christmases ago are at the top of my list and i will cherish them forever; a large collection of some newspaper articles of me, along with pictures of me wrestling and playing lacrosse as well as the warmest blanket i've ever had which she handmade.	i will never forget my grandmother's smile when she lived in apple valley and she would watch care bears and other cartoons with her.  i remember how excited taylor and i would be after getting the word that we would be going to grandma's.  whether it was going to the pool and ordering snickers ice cream bars or arizona iced tea (one of her favorites), she loved to spoil me and my brother.  my grandma could also give the greatest back scratches known to man and you should consider yourself lucky if you ever managed to get one out of her.  i loved looking in the local paper and seeing her name mentioned in her contest for the best garden as well.  i know that she loved making her house a home and making it a home to anyone and took great pride in making it as warm and comforting as herself.	i've never been a fan of the word 'goodbye' because i don't like thinking i won't see the person for a while.  i will never forget her smile two weekends ago when i last saw her.  though i know that was the last time i'll see her in this life, i know her smile will be ten times more beautiful the next time i see her.   so grandma, thank you for all of your love and support these 19 years of mine.  you have been a major influence in shaping me into the man i have become.  for that, i can never thank you enough.  i love you.  i miss you.  i can't wait until i see your beautiful face again.

amf_3in one single moment, your whole life can turn round i stand there for a minute, staring straight into the ground looking to the left slightly, then looking back down the world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown please let me show you where we could only just be for us i can change, and i can grow, or we could adjust the wicked thing about us is we always have trust we can even have an open relationship if you must i look at her, she stares almost straight back at me but her eyes glaze over, like she's looking straight through me her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity when they open up she's looking down at her feet dry your eyes mate i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up there's plenty more fish in the sea dry your eyes mate i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts but you've got to walk away now, it's over so then i move my hand up and down by my side it's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes i turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh 'cause i can't imagine my life without you and me there's things i can't imagine doing things i can't imagine seeing it weren't supposed to be easy, surely please, please, i'm begging, please she brings her hands up towards where my hands rested she wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with she peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures by pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers dry your eyes mate i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up there's plenty more fish in the sea dry your eyes mate i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts but you've got to walk away now, it's over and i'm just standing there i can't say a word because everything is just gone i've got nothing absolutely nothing trying to pull her close out of bear desperation put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying pull my head level with hers so that she might engage in look in to her eyes to make her listen again i'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now 'cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow and your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down you're well out of order now, this is well out of town she pulls away my arms, tightly clamped round her waist gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight turns around so she's now got her back to my face takes one step forward, looks back, then walks away dry your eyes mate i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up there's plenty more fish in the sea dry your eyes mate i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts but you've got to walk away now, it's over i know in the past i've found it hard to say telling you things, but not telling straight but the more i pull on your hand and say the more you pull away dry your eyes mate i know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up there's plenty more fish in the sea dry your eyes mate i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts but you've got to walk away now

amf_3i have some time to kill, so i figured i'd make an entry.this past week has been grand.  my dad drove me halfway to cincy where we met up with chris and leah at the jeffersonville mall.  chilled with them for the night (mostly leah's dad and i watching the usc/texas game) and had some fantastic "special order" wings that were bbq and hot.   chris and i woke up around 8 in cincinnatti, got his lights fixed and took off around 930.  we made some damn good time through the mountains.  we bought some fireworks in tennessee ("these are probably one of the two loudest in the store" said the salesman to chris, who bought them immediately) and didn't hit traffic until we got to atlanta.  chris drove the first 500 and some miles, and i picked up somewhere in georgia then drove the remaining 6 hours.  we got in around 11 or so at night since we only stopped a couple times for gas/drink and once for food.  went to taco bell, moved some of our stuff in and just crashed as soon as we got back.began showing chris and leah the social scene as best as i could.  bottle hockey will become the new rage as we chilled with andy, sean, robb and susan.  the next night we introduced bh to several new people, including fino, andrew and hammy.chris and i got ahold of a new recliner for the room that takes up, well... half of the walking space in our room, but its a sacrifice we're willing to make for comfort.  argh, i'm off to drop a class and add another.  i shall edit later

amf_3so yeh.  it's official.  jace isn't coming back next semester.  as much as it kills me to say this, i was glad to see him do it.  it's selfish of me to want to make him stay when they don't have his major at saint leo.  plus he's going to be doing graphic design at his new school, which is what the warrior advertising guy told him to do.  not only that, but he's the head coach now at his old hs.  i know he misses his family and they miss him, so its overall a better thing.  he told me the only thing that was keeping him from leaving was lacrosse.  we've been through so much shit together, good and bad.  it does suck though, because he's been not only my roommate, but one of my closest friends for the past year and a half.  it's not like we're going to not keep in touch.  i'm planning a trip up to madtown next summer. i'll miss you buddy.with that being said, chris and leah are transferring down to slu from the mount.  chris will be my new roommate.  we've talked about this a ton... who would have seen this coming?  chris and i roommates in college, let alone in florida.  honestly, i saw myself going to hollywood to be a stuntman before i saw myself playing lacrosse in florida.  haha, but yeh.  chris and i are going to drive down next thursday around 3 am from cincy (assuming i get a ride down there).  which means i'll be in cincinnati a week from now.  if we make the drive in a day (should be about 14 hours) we'll crash @ max's and move him in on friday.  i'll catch a ride with julian macmillan to orlando, stay @ joe's that night.  in the morning, we'll go to coach's goalie school which has kevin o'brien, an mll all-star goalie, along with some other amazing coaches.  i don't know if we'll wind up back at school on saturday night or sunday, but whatever.  i'm happy either way.so lets talk about these new computer speakers.  my little brother got me a 50$ gift card to best buy and i had to drive all the way to tuttle to get them with carver because easton and polaris both didn't have them.  i threw in some more money to get them and they are well worth it.  i can't wait to dominate the room with these bad boys. carver and i chilled yesterday for about the first time in a while.  hung out at my place and laughed at the people on next.  we rooted against the tool who got ditched for the money at the end.  went to polaris where i only accomplished returning my american eagle pants for mediums.  i was so confused, because she gave me a gift card for 21 bucks.  i took the pants too, but she didn't understand that i was switching them for a larger size.  i was asking her why she was giving me a gift card too, but she was so busy she didn't realize it.  ahh, holiday rush.  we went to charley's steakery for some philly cheeses.  big let down.  they were not nearly as good as i remember them.  anyway, we hung out some more and then went off to best buy where i bought the speakers from the previous paragraph.  work sucked ass today.  i had to wake up @ 6 am and worked a half day with adam since we're only allowed 35 hours a week on break.  and i'll end with that.  i'll update again later about last week.

amf_3so in other news, i've hung out with nick, chris, dex, ian, jace, stephanie, and somewhat jamie johnson the past two nights.  i saw chelsea baker, who i haven't seen since like, 5th grade.  i think she's the #1 or #2 pitcher @ osu.  went to her apartment and just chatted it up for about 20 minutes or so.

amf_3last night was one of the craziest nights i've had at slu.well, i got a visitor that i was really glad to see before i went back home.  this time she finally took her gift home with her and she completely threw me off guard, but i'm not complaining.so jace and i chilled in the room til andy came over.  went to san ann to get some beverages and came back to his apartment.  we started playing hi-lo (which he was guessing wrong almost every time) and claimed there was a conspiracy against him.  after that is where it became a blur.  i had my own little 12 pack to kill and most of it was gone within an hour or so.  the drinking game i had to play (on my own) was worse than the game of kings where i had to drink everytime someone said my name.  at least that only lasted like 5 mins.  i had to drink everytime anyone's name was said on futurama (bender, fry, professor, santa, etc) and then whenever a bubble came up on blind date.  then hammy, andrew lee, melissa and niffer rolled over.  hammy was equally as smashed as me and had kisses for everyone.  i have pictures for everyone as well once i upload them.  the quote of the night was, "when the gayest gay kid on campus tells you no, that means no"that was so clutch.  i drunk dialed jess.  haha, then i came back and puked for the third time this year.  no fun, especially that i just heard from jace that i tried to wash my mouth out with gatorade and was messing up doing that.  yeh.joe is here to take us to orlando with him.  jace and i fly into columbus and touch down around 5, so call me if you want to chill.  if you don't have my new number, gimme an im or leave a comment.lates.

amf_3yeh sure i guess i'll do another update while i'm in global perspectives.  currently we're talking about ... i don't know.  this man talks in the most monotonous voice ever.  if i had to hand write all that he was talking about i would probably be asleep.some random thoughts.  let's see how bad my add takes over see how random i can go based on whats on the board.  ivory coast.  ib.  work.  home in 9 days.  jace coming home with me for 3 days.  courtney cause she wants to ... do many naughty things to him.  my feet are cold.  i have no socks.  i need to do laundry.  jace did laundry last night.  sweet.  i need a haircut.  anyway.  i'm ridiculously bored so i'm just going to rant.  like i said, i'm coming home in 9 days (the 15th).  jace is coming home with me until the 18th.  i expect 3 straight crazy nights.  i will probably work from the 19-23rd or 24th, as well as the 26th-30th, and then some when the new year hits.  oh boy will this be fun.  my finals are as follows.  december 8th - human behavior and mathdecember 12th - us history and sciencedecember 13th - global perspective (going to suck)then we'll go to joe's for two nights and fly out of orlando the 15th at oneish i think.  anyway.  i really don't have much more to say.  so..lates

amf_3thanks a lot, kind stranger / matt.  jace and i truly appreciate the accent you gave our room by denting the door and kicking our window in.  we as a room decided that those two touches were just what we needed to make our room complete.  also, the lack of sleep i'll get today from your little escapade will be well worth it when i have to give a powerpoint presentation @ 830.   sttanding outside our door at 4 in the morning arguing with us and half-assing an apology you wouldn't give us earlier was a nice gesture.  it still weirds me out that you have my screen name, though.  it was nice you could blame a friend for such a nice deed, too.  i'm sure she appreciates it.thanks again!austin and jace (room alumni 111 if you wanna stop by later for anything else.  tea next time perhaps?)

first real update in a while


nov. 28th, 2005 at 11:00 am



 


amf_3alright, so we're back.  home was great.  i was back from saturday until this past saturday.ian and nick came and got me at the airport.  as soon as i got into the parking garage i took off my sweatshirt because, well... i felt home.  cold was home.  i soon started to dislike the cold and put my sweatshirt back on.went to nick's (he moved in with steve and a few others on campus) where we met up with amanda, haley and courtney.  played a great couple games of kings and was absolutely amazed by courtney's level.  haha, oh and osu beat michigan.  i expected looting, but there were cops on literally every corner.  the udf by b dubs is absolutely ridiculous.  they wouldn't let me buy beer because ian and i talked in line and ian isn't 21.  the guy was being a dick and said i was buying for him.  ian was just buying gum and had to show the guy his id.  wtf.  seriously.sunday was pretty swank.  went to ame's house and watched football with coach, his wife and my dad.  the coolest thing is that he has the nfl package, which gives him every game on dish, and he has the dvr so we could replay everything.  that was mind blowing.  later that night, i went to my brother's indoor game.  watched j mac tear it up some against the ua kids.  all sorts of fun there, except they lost.oh monday - wednesday i went and helped out wrestling.  not much else went on those days.  i finally bought a guitar from paul so nick strung it up for me.  this was possibly one of the funniest things i've ever heard.  "oh whats up biggie?  you think you can take me now that you're all bigger than me?  think you can use your hebrew powers,  think you the hebrew hammer?!  i'll fuck you up!  i'll fuck you and your crew up!!wait...i am your crew.  in that case, i'll see you on wednesday"-dex to ian via voicemailyeh, dexter lost like 40 pounds.  ian is now bigger than he is.wednesday was a blast.  first i drove down to the blue's station where i watched nick / ian / josh franck do open mic.  met up with them, kk and jeff hohl.  nick got a card from a promoter!!  it's about damn time.  i have an official recorded song of his if anyone would like to hear it.  he's uhh... pretty good.after that we went off to kk's where drunken mayhem ensued.  was immediately greeted by grant and willie like i had never left.  it was a much appreciated late welcome home party.  got there and started playing pong after watching grant thrash willie in what was their fourth game of football.  just like the summer, kk and i couldn't manage to beat grant and willie.  in 3 fucking games.  my "little sister" rolled up with tara.  they are by far the best team i've ever seen in pong.  ever.  [/sarcasm].  i was done with grant and willie's shit so i took them on by myself, where i won in dramatic comeback fashion.  i then proceeded to beat willie one on one.  i'm pretty sure nicole is interested in nick and vice versa so we'll see how that works.  the 2 am food run was pheonomenal.  ian was the only sober one and my cries of "left towards deliciousness!" were apparently the quote of the night.  not realizing it was thanksgiving day until we passed every mcd's / steak and shake / rally's /  wendy's / taco bell in sight, we settled for 7-11.  i immediately went for the huge ass bag of funions.  kk and i split a old, dry, cold tacquito we acquired for free.  i even offered the guy money but he said we could.  om that was delicious.woke up, and took off to my dad's.  later i went to my grandma's for thanksgiving, which was lovely.  still not used to eating in the winter, let alone thanksgiving.friday was awesome.  ian, dex and nick came over.  we ate pizza and caught up.  then we went over to ian's where euchre was played.  joey and paul showed up! i really missed how much fun we had in high school, but its great that we can still get together over breaks and such.  joey is apparently off to england next year as an exchange student.  blargh.  tried my whole sleep for 2 hours then get on a plane thing.  of course, it didn't work again.  eff that.  now i'm back here.another update is in the works about last night.  ee!

amf_3i really don't even know how to say this, so i'll just do it the best i can. some girls are just so ignorant of their surroundings. like girls who say that they don't want a "bad boy" but fall for them anyways. what pisses me off even more is the girls who say that they are looking for a nice guy, someone who is different. but what happens? they still cling to the asshole.this is shit i dealt with all through high school. and you know what? i never learned until the past couple of months. seems as if the girls nowandays haven't yet. i don't know if its just the female psyke or what.this isn't directed at just one girl, but towards several. you say you are done with guys who break your heart? look for the guys who try their best to prove to you they have no such intentions. found him? awesome, because you're still so fucking stuck on this previous dickhead that you can't see what's in front of you; a really great, caring guy. or the girls that claim they want a change of pace. some guy thats not a complete asshole. what happens? you date some new tool thats no better and you completely fuck over someone who you know would make you feel better. want to date some guy again that cheated on you before? have at it, just don't tell me about it because i really don't care anymore. i have no sympathy for you.fuck! i mean seriously get your act together girls. grow up. and if any girls think i'm wrong/mean; i'm sorry i just don't feel bad for you. furthermore, look at who you have dated or liked in the past year or so. i garauntee you regret at least one. there are very few girls who aren't blind to the type of guy is right for them. the problem is having the rest of you need to realize it.

amf_3ok, i don't think i've had a real update in like a month.  here it is.as usual, girls are confusing.  i really don't like to post specifics, but i enjoy being single, finally.  granted, i guess i (and everyone for that matter, i believe) am happier when i'm in a relationship.  blah.school is going great.  my midterms were a lot more stressful than they needed to be, but i believe the ends clearly justified the means.  at midterms, i have an a in math (wtf, i know) b+ in us history, b's in human behavior and global perspective, and a d in science (one bad test grade).  if i keep them up (and turn that d into like, a b) i'm going to be getting a car shipped down here my grandpa, i think.  sickness, yes.so theres a hurricane coming for us?  right now it's a category 2.  classes have been cancelled tomorrow.  so has practice and individuals.  time to batten down the hatches.last night was so sweet.  went to a party in a 1.5 million dollar house brittany was 'dogsitting' at.  of course, i was the dd for once.  she's definetly a cutie.  i guess there were a lot of moments where people were comin' in hot..according to her.  haha, oh man that girl is ...yeh.  the best thing about being the dd though, was driving home the srt-4 and going 100 on the highway.  ohh that was all sorts of fun.oh did i mention we beat u of central florida?  i split time w/ adam and joe, but adam and i gave up a goal each.  we won like, 16-5.  i had 3 saves.  go me.i will definetly make more random, updates like i used to.i'm also going to redo the post i had about the trip to usf.lates

amf_3it's official, i'm coming back home over thanksgiving break.  i miss my boys (mainly nick, kk, carver, sam, thompson) too much to not.  plus i'd have to have dinner w/ my mom and such, see my brother and dad.anyway, i get this call about 1:30 am this morning.  and of course, it's kk.  we start chattin' up and he's like, "hold on, some drunk idiot is puking all over my living room.  he wants to talk to you."  of course it's nick.  nick starts ranting and i told him he made my day.  he claimed it made his day worse.  also, adam is being held at the columbus jail for murder?  i found out last night he's been there for a month and he's under a 1,000,000 bail?!  wow.  i hope so much that he didn't do it.  i hope to god he didn't. on a lighter note, nick and kk went to open mic, got drunk, and nick brought 5 girls back to kk's and played guitar for them?  how funny is that.  of course nick would do such a thing.  why wouldn't he..?  apparently, me and kimmy are hooking up when i get back?  haha.  even willie said what up.  kk told me there's going to be a party centered around my return.  i shall be in attendance, and festivities will be in full swing.  i found some tickets for like, 260$ through southwest.  huzzah!anyway, i love being in this math class.  i got a 120% (36/30) on my last math test and i can pretty much do what i want in here.  in fact, i'm just typing away on my laptop.  weee!i'm out.  lates

amf_3so today was a good practice.  "julian, i got your near!"  "brady i got your 1, i'm right here!"  i haven't heard communication like that in so long.  it's great to hear (most) of the defense talking like that when they should be.  it's such a great thing.  both of our new offensives we put in were running really well today.  3v2 fast breaks were the highlight of my day though.  first to 10 had to do 50 pushups, either the defense made a save, missed shot, or took it.  offense had to score.  we (the d) won like, 10-8.  i somehow made this ridiculous save off-stick high 1v1 against one of our better attackmen, chris.  the team is coming together quite nicely.  we're starting to get a feel for who we want as the first and second line mids, and who should be starting on d.  the goalie situation isn't clear cut yet, but i really don't care.  we should figure it out by october.  if not, home opener is february 11th against brad campbell and mars hill.  that should be all sorts of fun.so yeah.  it's official, and get your calendars ready.  we play university of central florida at home oct 8th @ 1 pm on the practice field.  i know it's a little less than a month away, but i seriously can't wait.  anyway.  i'm tired and need sleep.lates

get a snack...cause this is going to be a severely long story


sep. 8th, 2005 at 8:52 pm



 


amf_3so i guess now is as good a time as any to update.  i've been in florida at my new school for almost three weeks now.  tomorrow would be the 21st day.  i honestly can't complain.  i love it here.  i'm only having trouble adjusting to a few things; the humidity and the massive amount of bugs.  imagine cedar point when you're there at night and you see swarms of gnats.  the only diff is that it starts here at like, six.  school is going well.  i only really dislike one of my classes.  it's not that i don't even like it, it's just ... i don't even know.  it drags on for the entire 80 minutes.  but the good thing is that its only tuesday and thursday.  human behavior perspective, i believe it is.  i feel like i'm at a real university, unlike at north-east.  we have multiple housing areas, including some sweet apartments i plan on moving into next year with jace and two other people.  there is a completely (isolated) area that's freshmen housing only.  right now i'm on a lap top that the school gave me.  and let's talk about this lacrosse team.first off, i'm so grateful for my coach giving me this huge oppurtunity by bringing me in.  personally, i wouldn't say i'm struggling but it definetly is hard adjusting to the way he wants me to play.  he's making me change the positioning of my hands on my stick, the way i hold it and even the movements to make a save.  granted, i know this will pay off in the end, but it's gonna be a tough couple of next weeks.  it sucks, because we'll do six-on-sixes and i'll be so worried about how my hands are that i'll completelt blank out and not make the save i should.  enough about me.  i love this team, i really do.  it really feels like we're a real team with real coaches.  i have total trust in everyone on the team.  everyone gets along with everyone else, for the most part, and we're all gelling nicely.  i personally have no problems with anyone on the team at all.  i truely believe that we can take the independent this year and have a shot at the ncaa tourny.  if we were able to knock off everyone we play, which is very possible, we have a shot as the southern bid if someone manages to beat limestone.anyway.  i thank god jace is my roomie again this year.  again, he was the only kid i felt i could have lived with last year besides shane, my original roommate.  unfortunately, he's dealing with some family issues right now back home in wisconsin so i'll be by myself until tuesday.  i think i can manage though.  i did make it 3 months without him this summer.  so part of the greatness of this team is how much we chill on the weekends.  no one is excluded from any of the festivities.  i've had two great nights with hammy.  multiple with the likes of eric, mark, ben, andrew (my all-time bp partner)  last friday, nick and i had a great time.  i won't go into detail unless i make this a private post, but again, i'm glad i was able to share it with the people that i did.  in other news, i lost my phone friday night around 1 am in the apartments quad.  i have no idea how i lost it, but i did.  this resulted in me cancelling my nextel service and ordering a new phone through sprint.  this does mean that i have a florida number now, which leads me to my next thought. i plan on staying down here this summer and taking classes.  i'm not for sure where i'll be staying but chances are its with a teammate.  i'll get a job somewhere...i don't really care where as long as i'm making at least the money i made this summer.  and here's the kicker, the classes are every other saturday.  cha-ching!well that's enough for now.  i really am going to try and update this more than once a month with actual updates as well.  lates.

all mixed up


aug. 17th, 2005 at 4:10 am



 


amf_3i have so many mixed emotions running though me right now.  tonight was a great night, minus the ending, but a great night nonetheless.  75 cents for drafts, you can't beat that.  30+ oz. drafts at that.  anyway.  part of me wants to stay here, go to osu.  stay here with my friends and watch my little brother grow up.  but no, the logical side is telling me, go to florida where it's warm, play d2 lacrosse with jace, get your degrees and be happy.  there is no reason to stay here outside of those reasons though.  it's not like i have a girlfriend or anything here, or even a girl worth staying for here.   i dunno, it's just nights like this that make me not wanna leave.  i might edit this later, but i probably won't.-stin

so yeh


aug. 5th, 2005 at 9:02 am



 


amf_3so i'm sorry i didn't meet my goal of 2 updates a month.  deal with it.this summer is shaping up to be the best, up there with two summers ago.  a lot has happened in the past month, and i'm happy to say i've spent it with the people that i've wanted to spend it with.  last summer i didn't really work too much, it's just that i didn't get out enough.  this summer i've been workin' till 8 or so, then going out till 2, 3, 4 am (even going as far as 4:40 one night) and then getting up at 8 and doing it all over again.  i was supposed to work today, but it's storming and i don't want to leave right now.  plus it's an overtime day, they can deal with me not being there for a couple hours.  i plan on calling soon and just saying something like 'oh, we lost electricity and my alarm clock didn't go off' or an excuse of that nature.  but nate and everyone else in westerville is at work, so i don't know how well that excuse will fly. i'll go in here sooner or later.so yeh, this summer has been sweet.  let's talk about that for a minute.  warped tour down in cincy with chris and sam (no!  i don't wanna take the spring street exit! nnoooo!!! i don't wanna!!), chillin' with kk and others down on campus, and nick.  that's been pretty much my entire last month.  like i said in my last post, there's a ton of things that have happened, but the people i shared them with were there and anyone else that wants to know i've told them said actions.  i mean, maybe it will be different once i get down to florida and all, but i just don't really feel like putting everything i do in here anymore.  also, my dad found this, and my webshots, so i'm kinda laying low for a while.speaking of school, i leave two weeks from today.  i'm flying down with my dad around 930am the 19th of august.  i have a ticket to come back that's good for 12 months.  i don't know when i'll use it.  so here's to all the people i've talked to this summer.  actions speak louder than words.  granted, i have not intentionally done this, but there were people i've wanted to hang out with more, or at all (like shane), and i haven't.  it's not that i don't want to, it's just like i said earlier with the whole work thing.  my work sucks.  a lot.  so when i say i'm too tired to go out, i really mean it.  my last day of work is tomorrow.  after that i have two weeks free for doing anything.  i've made the first step towards a lot of people to hang out before i leave, now it's yours.  unlike last summer, when i was like, 'i don't know when i'll be coming back' i mean it this time.  i mean, granted i'll be home for christmas, but i don't know much more outside of that.  spring break will be spent in charlotte, nc and chances are i'll be taking summer classes down at saint leo.  so i'm serious when i'm like, "i don't know the next time i'll be home".  i'm out.  i got work to do around the house and need to come up with a reason for not going into work.

amf_3first off, i just read that london was attacked with 4 bombs in the subways and a bus.  everyone please keep our allies across the pond in your thoughts and prayers.on a better note, this is where i'll be going to school next year as well to play lacrosse.  and yes, it is in tampa, fl.  i only kept saying i was going to be going back to mne because joe ernst still had my check from working at the fittness center along with my 70$ dollar shaft.  i knew if i just told him i was leaving that he'd try and keep it, or withold my transcripts like he said he was going to.  i've talked to about 5-6 guys on the lax team as well as a few non-laxers and even a few cuties.  everyone seems so cool and ready for thiscoming year.  i love myspace.  i'm looking so forward to next year, because it's a whole 'nother chance to start over...again.  it's yes, again a first year program but it's d2.  another great thing, i got my boy jace coming with me.  we're tryin' to get into a 2-room apartment with a kitchenette so jace can do his thang cookin'.  i'm just really excited to go to a real university instead of a juco where they don't even have what i want to do with my life.  here at least, i'm going to get my teaching degree [yes, little known fact, i've always wanted to be a teacher] and i'm going to get ace certified [hopefully by the end of summer, if not then during school] and finally my massage therapy degree.  i also have a job lined up at the tampa egl so i'm even thinking about staying down there during the summer.  i just wanna get this all figured out.in other news, this summer has been so fun.  i've enjoyed pretty much every minute of it, except work, and i've been able to enjoy quality time with quality people.  i went and saw 3 fireworks shows [red, white and boom; central college, and westerville's] with thompson, sam and two girls from the first one, then my little bro and nick to cc and w'ville's with my dad and nick.  speaking of neek, we've been biking just about everynight we have off and usually ride about 10 miles a night.  we even made it from my house to marble slab in like, 8 minutes.  i've spent a couple of great night's @ kk's house.  i've hung out with some awesome females even.  i can't believe i got this number from a girl who's on the osu gymnastics team last night.  she's pretty cute and she even told me i better call her, which probably really means i have no chance.  ::chuckle:: ohhh, i'm actually tryin' my hardest not to fall for any girls this summer, but i've said that the past what...59 summers and look what happened.i'm sure i'll update more often this summer than once a month, but this is all i got now.  just a huge thank you to everyone i've hung out with this summer, cause you've made it an awesome one so far.

amf_3so i had a quality entry going, then my computer decided to turn off.  and not turn back on.  my hunch is that the power source overheated.  i just gotta buy a new one when i get home.this weekend was a much needed break.  i went home friday night to take back my bigger objects from the room, like my tv, stereo, majority of clothes, microwave, fridge...etc.  basically everything but my computer, some random shit and a few clothes.  so...i hung out w/ s and l friday night when i got home.  made "beer floats" which is like a root beer float but without the root.  well, until s adds some that is.  saturday morning i went to the jv and varsity lax games.  saw my boys (and josh/eric) tear up some cleveland heights folk.  this summer is gonna be fun workin' them two on some goalie...ing.  saturday night i rolled over to nick's.  found out that the mystery girl i apparently had sex with is none other than ...i won't say her name, but i definetly did not.  in fact, i have not had sex with a girl from this school all year.  so pretty much chris knew the story from jace to back me up in that i did not have sexual relations with that woman.  so...we pretty much chilled @ nicks for a while, kicked back and told stories about this year and next.  hopp'd over to ian's new place and just hung out there too.  headed over to sam's house w/ taylor.  lesley was there and we raided many a wendy's because they had the free jr. forsty weekend (my total for the weekend was 12)i'll update this later, because i'm about to head to bed, for the last time @ mne (for a while).  the main point is i just got done w/ my comp apps final project, and just turned down a 20$ offer to give it to someone.  fuck that.  it's worth hella more than 20$.ps.  i'm coming home tonight, hopefully in time to watch my boys take on hilliard.  call or text my cell to chill after.

amf_3so you know my research paper i've been talking about?  the one i've spent hours researching for and was so worried about?  wel the rough draft is due in roughly 10 hours, and i got my final draft done!  so relieved.  so...so relieved.  the best part is that the final is the research paper is due on monday.  so i'm more or less done with one of my finals.  to be added to the schedule, workin' out w/ mark reamy this summer.  thank god for my "natural aderol" (brulport).  fuck!  this research paper has gotten to me.annotated bibliographybrulport, taylor.  personal interview. 12 may 2005.  earlier in the hallway, taylor and i were discussing work this summer, and he said i have natural aderol cause i stay up all night and do homework and shit.  oh well.  this summer's gonna be tight working with osu marc and brian.  i'll actually have the same shift as adam with hopefully tom and taylor, if he can get the same schedule.  so the piglax championship again was fun today.  trey and nate made the championship cup which is i shit you not at least 3 feet tall.  i'll post a picture on here sooner or later.  i had won last night, beating jace in 12 ot's.  nate won it again today, then jace reclaimed it, then ralston finally got his name on it.  i'd love to post more in depth, but i've been typing my research paper since 9 or so and put in a solid 5 hours of work with only about an hour for breaks.  i'm so going to bed.  after i clean up the room a little.   lates

amf_3i figure i might as well post again.yep, you guessed it i haven't gone to bed yet.  i was up until 330 this morning, a routine i find myself getting into as i get closer and closer to school being out.  i just can't seem to fall asleep.  maybe sometime this summer i'll see a doctor and see if i can't get some sleeping pills or something.so nate and i had a p-i-g lacrosse championship monday.  27 ot's it took until nate hit the crossbar and i couldn't follow up.  the 300,000 in attendance went nuts and it's already on espn classics.  somehow before work jace managed to beat both of us today, but since he's still officially an amatuer it didn't count.  plus he was trying.  cause i wasn't. sooo much to look forward to this summer.  in june i'm driving down to florida w/ my grandparents and taylor to st. augustine and tampa.  this year i'll be doing some of the driving so that will increase vacation time at our destinations.  i'm hoping to come up to wisconsin june 12-14th or so for brat fest and a lacrosse tournament.  jace, rols and brad i'm sure that will be a good time.  and of course, i'm off to canada w/ nate the last week in july.  g-unit together for a whole week?  it's gonna be nuts.  last but not least of my pending plans is a visitor from hudson and trips up there.  wooo!i'm going to be working a lot w/ eric and josh this summer to, as much as our schedules allow.  work is going to suck.  i just hope and pray that i don't have some injury that prevents me from working like last summer.  no fun i tell you.  monday - wednesday and saturday i'll be working @ eagle from 9:30 am til 8:00 pm.  i'm going to try and pick up another job @ midwest lacrosse but i don't realistically see that happening.  i might be able to work at a dm or something (oh man how i'll miss the walks to dm w/ nate, jace and/or ralston) at nights that i don't have work the following day.  like, wednesday and thursday night.  maybe.  the weekends (for the most part) are mine this summer.  that means plenty of workin' out and boozing.  yeh, i know i didn't drink much in high school, maybe 2 or 3 times, but i enjoy the occassionaly brew now w/ good company.  kings is fun if you're with the right crowd and there are few things drinking wise that's funner than making your opponent drink by tossing a ping pong ball in their cup.  i just had an idea. well it's not like i just had it or anything but i definetly want to make a pong table like the one i saw at someone's house, who will remain annonymous for security reasons.i'm actually relieved that lacrosse is done and over with.  not for good, obviously but definetly mne this year.  it's so fun to just go shoot with nate and jace, throw around and kick back without having to worry about doing bullshit two minute drills because we took 40 seconds to get water on a water break.  wow, this turned out to be a much longer than i thought it would be.  probably my biggest accomplishment this week had to be getting my computer apps homework done tonight.  it's due next wednesday but man you have no idea how great it is to get that over a week ahead of time.  i'll end on a funny story.  to a certain someone, the funniest story ever.  coming back tonight in my car jace got pulled over down the street by one of two north east police.  a bunch of bullshit about his wi id expiring and not even being real.  it wasn't anything major at all either.  i have a busted taillight on the centur (yeh, no y on the trunk) and jace just happened to be driving my car when a cop spotted him.  luckily he got a warning so we're good on that.  jace doesn't speed, but i immediately thought he was speeding for some reason.  there was a whole bunch more bullshit that went on, like them training a gun on jace b/c they thought he had one on him and all sorts of "poppycock."  jace, if you read this feel free to comment.i'm out.  good morning/good night  lates.could be a melon, looks like a co-co-nut.  yehh, a) we're the coolest people alive.

mark speaks the truth


may. 11th, 2005 at 2:47 am



 


amf_3this was writing by a good buddy of mine, mark reamy . this isn't addressed toward anyone in particular... but um, a big fuck you to all of the girls who were completely shitty to me in the past... i won't even get into specific logistics as this expansive pseudo list (in that, of course i haven't created it, it's just a vague estimate) is probably quite over 50 people, and it's not even that i hold some sort of grudge... but i can see how it fucks with me to this day and i don't think it's fair. girls want to talk so much bullshit all the time about how they're fucked over consistently and emotional baggage... yadda yadda yadda. you fuck over boys just as much as they do you, so let's just chill out.girls have this insane ability to somehow take advantage of a dude's niceness... that's right, we're not even talking about using dudes for anything tangible like money or drugs -- just simply a higher degree of respect.there are few people in my life that i've met that haven't liked me, or haven't grown to like me once they understand what i'm all about. (and to those others, fuck em) yet, despite this high level of success, i remain lonely because i actually respect the girls that i'm after. whether or not girls would like to admit it, what they say they want and what they actually want seems to be two entirely different things. this is why girls date assholes. assholes present themselves as a challenge and that's somehow boss. if this entry seems offensive, it's because i've been offended by women's treatment toward me for as long as i've been old enough to be after them. sorry?

amf_3http://www.wlfi.com/index.cfm?action=dsp_story&storyid=66961a lafayette woman is in stable condition after being thrown from a vehicle.  the accident happened around 8:30 p.m. on friday at the intersection of 9th and salem streets.lafayette police said 17-year-old eric jones of lafayette, who was driving a ford focus, ran a red light.  he struck a chevy trailblazer, driven by 58-year-old thomas spitznagle of lafayette. police said a passenger in the back seat of the trailblazer, 65-year-old connie worthington, was not wearing a seat belt and was thrown from the s-u-v.  she is currently in stable condition at saint elizabeth medical center.police said another passenger in the trailblazer, 54-year-old kathie spitznagle, and eric jones were both treated and released at saint elizabeth hospital.my aunt is connie worthington.  she has to endure several more eye surgeries and might lose her vision and possibly her eye because some fucking kid couldn't wait a minute for a light.  if you read this, please think twice about running a red light.  i know i joke about it (key word joke) green means go, yellow means speed up and red means gun it, but i have never actually just ran through a red light.  this is so fucking aggravating.  maybe i'll just black the kid's eye bad so he knows a little bit of how it feels.  please pray for my aunt.  she needs it.

amf_3this weekend was a good one.  friday night we had the recruits in, rod and matt.  both really cool kids and both didn't drink or smoke, which is a first besides nolan and ryan.  but anyway, went to onandoga and got thoroughly trashed.  but, my first year of college lacrosse is over.  this has been the first season for any sport, ranging from wrestling to soccer to baseball to lacrosse where i wanted it to be over.  all the bullshit we dealt with...all the pain of shin splints and the minor stress fracture all winter wasn't worth getting our asses kicked every game except for one, canton.  speaking of which, i owe hamot medical center like 73$ for my xray which turned out inconclusive anyway.  2 more weeks and i won't have the same address anyway, so it's doubtful i'm paying.  plus, they messed up by making my insurance not pick it up, so yeh.this research paper is kicking my ass.  i'm doing an anti-affirmative action paper on why aa is wrong and shouldn't be in effect.  i got my annotated bibliography and proposal done and turned in.  $so abby saw her first lacrosse game yesterday.  watched two future mne laxers, nate and tom play @ mcdowell.  chilled w/ jace, rols and hilyer.  sat in sub-zero temperatures, but it was cool cause abby blocked the wind and we shouted random nonsensical comments from the stands.  today was awesome.  slept in til like 11 or so.  no classes tues/thurs so that's always a plus.  worked on some dvdege and my research paper then went to work.  coach set jace and i up with a job @ the fitness center where we work at the front desk and just keep track of who comes and goes.  of couse there's also the extra little tasks like dusting the weights or cleaning the machines and that will carry into next fall and winter, so that's cool.  fordcrest, out!hooters

amf_3so last night was well worth the lack of sleep.  i don't want to jinx anything, but watching zoolander and wet hot american summer...was one of the best nights i've had here, and the best that didn't involve nate or jace.  i don't know how i got so lucky...anyway.  we lost to canton by one.  i played goal all game, had a great game and we lost 9-8.  we were down 5-1 at half, and we almost had it.  again, i'm not mentioned in the website, just like i wasn't mentioned whenever i win 8/11 faceoffs or if i win 5/6 in the fourth quarter against the #10 team in juco.  no big deal though.so yeah about last night.  the only dissappointment was that the best of will ferrell pt. 2 was messed up.  it was said that i messed it up, but as we all know, that's pure poppycock.  today i gave my speech on how to homebrew your own beer..  mr kennedy seemed thoroughly impressed.  i'm going to attempt this feat over the summer.  i'm sure my dad won't mind.  uhh...bbq @ my house sometime this summer?so we play onadoga tomorow @ 6.  it's their senior night.  these guys lost to d1 syracuse 11-7.  only a mere 4 hour ride to get destroyed, and then another 4 hours back.  so we won't get back til like, 2 am because our bus driver goes at the limit or like, 5-10 under.  and we have recruits coming in today.  and apparently they're staying til sunday?  blaeaugh.  i don't want to be w/ them saturday night...oh well.  i'm off to nap until like, 20 mins from now.  i think i'll kill another sobe.  yeh, that sounds good.so...19 days till i'm home?  see you all then.

amf_3so yeh.  at least the bus ride home was fun last night.  we lost 17-4 and since we were missing 2 people due to illness and a funeral, i had to run middy.  well, at least i won most of my faceoff's, again.  taylor scored 2, brad and hilyer scored also.  it sucks when you lose to a shitty team because you don't have the depth. but at least canton is shit, they've lost to the same teams we have by about the same number.  but anyway, the busride home was pretty fun.  kenny and i got into a spitball fight, and i sniped him hardcore, including a couple that stuck to his eyebrow, face, and his earhole.  i even got jacobs pretty good cause he spit spite in my direction.  so jace and i pretty much were too sore to move anywhere, plus i'm pretty much sick.  we just stayed in last night and watched our favorite movie, spiderman 2.  and best of will ferrel, vol 2 cause kelly was nice enough to bring it down.i'm..tired and sore and bored.  lates

been a long time comin'


apr. 22nd, 2005 at 3:36 pm



 


amf_3so yeh.  i decided to lj it up again.  it's been a crazy year, but it's almost over, in terms of school.  lacrosse has been a bust, we're 0-8 or something like that.  we'll probably finish out to be 1-10, with our only win coming from canton.  seems like all the bullshit we've dealt with this year hasn't really been worth it.  no one likes losing.  especially not me.  i'll be back here next year though, unless something drastic happens.  our last game i thought was fun anyway.  when nate's in goal, i do faceoffs.  it was like, 60 and raining, so it wasn't bad, then it rained, and stopped, rained and stopped, then rained and stopped finally.  then it just got cold and now i think i'm sick.  i won 8/11 faceoff's, which is a 73% which is damn good for any faceoff man.  we still lost like, 19-8 though.  there was no mention of my faceoff wins or jace's assist and goal on the website or the erie paper, which lists scores and goals.right now i'm carrying like, either a 3.2 or a 3.1 gpa.  i haven't checked up on my transcripts in a bit.  this college writing ii class i have is tough as shit.  i manage to somehow pull off b's mostly on my papers though.  in fact, i got a 88% on my mini-research paper i got back tonight.  i was pretty estatic about that.  i have like, the funniest teacher ever as my public speaking teacher.  mr. kennedy is like, 60some, large and in charge.  he throws out cuss words like they're free and he's the distribution man.  it's fucked up, because 40% of our grade is written test based.  our midterm was today.  70 questions were true/false and 30 were mulitple choice.  how about this.  we had to do a 4 min talk two weeks ago, and i was apparently going 3rd on the first day because 3 people in front of me didn't show up.  i ad-libbed the entire thing and got a 90.  my comp apps class is easy.  i have an "a" in the class and i don't do anything.  i do the required papers, then sit there and play noah's ark, or some other games from addictinggames or miniclip.i really can't wait till i come home.  i should be home may 17th, and i'm counting down the days.  i've missed all my friends back home, and especially taylor.  i'm going to be working at eagle again probably 3 or 4 days a week, and also picking up another couple jobs.  this year taught me i can't waste anymore money than i already did and as a results, i have like, 200$ to my name.  i'm going to try and pick up a job @ midwest lacrosse in dublin because i talked to the guy who works there.  he told me to come in when i get back and i'm pretty sure i have it.  i'll just work there a couple days a week when i'm not at eagle.  it'd be nice to just relax there, get paid to string sticks like jace has taught me, and just talk about lacrosse.  and get paid for it.  i also submitted some stuff to this website, laxnation.com to try and be a reviewer for goalie gear.  if i win, they basically give me shit to review and then give it to me.  that'd be a nice little sidejob.  plus i'm going to be working a saints day camp for north east somewhere in the middle of july.  on top of that, i talked to grant, my hs wrestling coach, and i'm going to be helping run open mats, clinics and camps as a day coach or something.  i think my coaching skills @ medina helped on that, and when chris & i came back over thanksgiving break.  go me.  even though i can't wait to be home, i'm going to miss a couple people here, hardcore.  jace, nate and rals became my best friends here right away.  i know i'll come away here with some really good friends, mainly hummer, gordo, tay, brad, shane (my original roomie) and yes even dom and kenny.  i know i'm going up to wiscompton, as it's called to chill with jace and brad.  i know i'm gonna visit nate in teh burgh' and we're gonna hang out.  of course, rols and i are gonna chill because we live like, a few miles apart.  i know our spot of hanging out will be, and it ends in "hipotle" cause we gotta make up for lost time.  so pretty much my plans for the summer are work, get better at lacrosse, and spend as much time as i can with my friends and family.  i'm going to try my best to avoid getting another dumb injury like pinching a nerve in my neck.  but god did that so it led to my heart surgery, which has made me live better.  i just know i was bitter and angry most of the time because i couldn't play lacrosse or work most of the summer b/c of the neck thing.  i'm also thinkin' about maybe even taking some classes at columbus state to get started on my massage therapy license.  speaking of c state, i talked to the coach this past week.  last year when i was pretty sure i was going there before i came here, i talked to him a couple times.  he was telling me they have a few club games over the summer, so i think i might join them on that for some fun.     i really regret not updating my lj since like, i don't even know when.  i just checked it, and wow, it was valentine's day.  i went home for spring break and easter.  my bro taylor turned 15 march 9th and i turned 19 april 6th.  mercyhurst has since added facebook.  if you feel the urge to check it out, the link is here.  i'd like to give complete recaps on what all has happened, but i really don't think anyone wants to read it.  i figure the people who really care were there, or i already told.  so yeh.  hazlett and i made up at brittanie's party.  i even had the pic up for a while as my background.  i figure there's "no more bad blood" as he put it.  drunk or not, we made up.  it was about time.  and it was cool."i just thought she was really friendly.  but after the third time telling me that i'm making out with her and no other girl, it kinda hit me"-ralston, who has the comment of the moment.i'll end on that note.  feel free to comment and rejoice about my return to livejournal.lates

amf_3lacrosse has been great recently.  last week we finally got on the field and good times were had by all.  it was about 40*, and damp.  the air was chilly, and the ground was wet but the mood was so energetic.  dom got sandwiched between ralston and ryan, then fell in a giant puddle.  so in ...revenge?  dom got a clean hit on hummer and knocked him into another puddle.  jace got a ground ball, started giggling and shane knocked the stick out of his hands.  i think i did really well.  i saved all shots except for 2 1v1's.  one was somewhat funny though, because ryan snuck away from dom...i was like, "dom!  crease!  hilyer!" and guess who scored like, 3 seconds later.  the last play was a man down where the shot went wide, i chased it, went right, was trapped by hilyer, switched left and cleared.  lovely.  today we're going back outside and i can't wait.  half the time i can't even see the ball indoors.  but oh well.this weekend was awesome.  farin and michelle flew in from wisconsin with some trickery.  we spent the entire weekend with them, including me letting michelle win at the game @ damon's.  we pretty much spent our nights watching movies...massages...whatnot.  well, giving them.  i got a total of like, 10 minutes.  but oh well.  the quote from my last journal entry had to do when jace and i went to take them to the airport.  still got the "sweet easy to talk to guy" syndrome going on though.  and to hell with valentine's day.  it's seriously like, the worst day ever celebrated.
