we have nothing but good things to say about saphire estate! our event producer was such a pleasure to work with and made our vision come to life. the grounds at are breathtaking and the food was wonderful. all of the staff members make you feel like royalty and give you their undivided attention throughout the whole process. i wouldn't change a thing about our experience!
 avery & samuel bride & groom 

the villa exceeded all of my expectations. so many of our guests are still raving about how pretty the site was, and how amazing the food was! our event coordinator helped us every step of the way and the service on the actual wedding day was impeccable as well. if you're looking for a beautiful outdoor or indoor wedding venue with quality service (and food!), look no further!
 brooke & isaiah bride & groom 

avenir is an unbelievable wedding venue! the whole property is very modern, elegant, & glam. the staff is very professional & hardworking. my organized and patient event producer brought my vision to life & helped with the little details. the food was delicious, cooked to perfection, and received many compliments from my guests. whatever your vision is, this group will work hard to make it happen.
 janelle & tucker bride & groom  

highly recommend saphire event group and their new lakehouse location! the true excitement, organization and support from the team made the whole time leading up to the day and the actual wedding day run so smoothly! we were able to fully enjoy our wedding together as a couple and with our guests because of this.
