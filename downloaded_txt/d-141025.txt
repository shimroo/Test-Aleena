where the wild things play
“i am interested in how the wild beast lives in the jungle, not in the zoo.”
the wild beast








the composer morton feldman used the term “wild beast” as a metaphor for the ineffable generative force in art—making it the ideal name for calarts’ iconic music pavilion. the pavilion houses a highly flexible performance and rehearsal space for our students and faculty, as well as an outstanding venue for public concerts.
