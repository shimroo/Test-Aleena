assistireland.ie

the citizens information board's website assist ireland (assistireland.ie)
provided information about aids, appliances and assistive technology. the
website was discontinued in december 2019 following analysis undertaken of the
substantial resources required to maintain it and following significant reduced
demand for the resource.
in recent years, most suppliers of assistive technology (also sometimes
known as aids and appliances) have their own websites. you can browse all their
products online, and buy online. some suppliers also have retail shops. to find
suppliers, search using 'aids and appliances', 'aids for daily living' or
'mobility aids' in your browser.
if you are a medical card holder you may be entitled to get certain aids and
appliances for free. if you are not sure what equipment you need, or how to get
it, contact your local public health nurse in your local
health centre.
the disabled living
foundation (dlf) in the uk publishes factsheets on some of the equipment
available to help with daily living. these factsheets provide advice on
adapting your home and information on daily living equipment such as what to
look for when choosing equipment.
information is available from the alzheimer society of ireland on how
assistive technology can help people with dementia and their families
(pdf).
