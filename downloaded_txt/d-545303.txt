ken timmerman is a superb
                    investigative reporter--and old school--which means
                    he does his research. his behind-the-scene
                    adventures in iraq, syria, egypt, israel and even
                    france are a terrific read for those of us who share
                    his passion for tracking down the facts, not molding
                    the facts to a narrative.

"and the rest
                        is history is a memoir that reads like a
                      rollicking, page-turning novel.  from the
                      cold war through the war on terror and beyond, ken
                      takes us on the wild adventure that has been his
                      life as a global-trotting reporter: we enter war
                      zones and the halls of power, eavesdrop on
                      conversations with world leaders, terrorists, arms
                      dealers, and spies, and become witnesses to
                      extraordinary history.  dripping in vivid

this is one of the most important
                        books in the last 50 years. ken has zeroed in on
                        the importance of man's belief in god. his
                        personal experience is a light in a world that
                        is slipping into darkness. thank you ken!!
