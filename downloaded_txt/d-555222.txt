"being a greenie (musicman camp staff member) gave me the opportunity to start guided teaching at a young age— which made me realize that i want to be a music educator!"

—mia yocco, music education major, west chester university





"i can see the impact of summer stage on my own life and the lives of many others, and i am proud to pass on this love of art and the importance of community to my children. this is the legacy of summer stage— finding a place to call home and a way to share the magic, on or off stage."

—kelly ann pipe, summer stage parent and former participant





"my son loves the art at camp. he gets to create in ways that cater to his interests, like integrating letters into his art. he enjoys meeting new people and expressing himself through his art, especially since he’s not very verbal. it’s been a great process, and he loves it here—he just wishes it lasted longer!"

—parent, butterfly buddy camp





"summer stage has a big impact on her confidence and self-esteem. she feels a sense of belonging here that she hasn't found at school or in our neighborhood."

— erika l., parent, summer stage children’s theatre





"the libraries work with udaef student volunteers, serve as collection points for the holiday toy drive, and have gathered donations for murphy's giving market— three examples of successful partnerships created from conversations with collaborative members.

—jennifer stock, director of libraries, sellers library
