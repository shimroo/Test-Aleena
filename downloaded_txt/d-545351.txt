hypno-gram free preview


 become a member today!!!the national guild of hypnotists has been acknowledged, even by other professional hypnotism groups, as the number one association in the field. we invite you to share in the prestige and recognition membership brings, by joining the nation’s premier hypnosis organization.the national guild of hypnotists® was founded in 1950








 
by a small group of hypnotists who were connected with dr. rexford l. north at the boston hypnotism center. we were stage hypnotists, hypnologists, and several university students who went on to be internationally recognized as hypnosis experts in the psychology and medical world.
yes, we started as a small group compared to the world-wide organization that we have become in the past seventy years, but we believed and we achieved!
here are some of the benefits established for all of our members
journal of hypnotism® magazine – march, june, september, december
hypno-gram® e-zine – jan/feb, apr/may, jul/aug, oct/nov
continuing education workshops – various locations in u.s. and canada, annually
solid gold weekend conference – advanced classes in las vegas, annually
board certification examinations – twice annually, august and february
oldest and friendliest annual convention – august, marlborough, ma
professional liability insurance source available for certified members
union affiliation with multiple benefits available thru membership in nfh guild 104
additional member-friendly website resources
 
since we were originally established as a “membership” organization, we realize that not every
member of the guild is interested in being in professional practice. with this in mind, we will always
do our best to provide a professional organization that serves the varied needs and preferences of all of
our members and their various interests.
dr. dwight damon
president

our invitation from dr. dwight damon
“that’s what the ngh convention 2024 is all about.”








a concentrated three day idea exchange, packed with enlightening presentations, extraordinary networking opportunities, and plenty of inspiration … all designed to provide you with an action list filled with new ideas and strategies you will begin using first thing the following week!
these are times of tremendous challenge; they require the best of each of us. by coming together for a weekend of collaborative learning with the nation’s leading hypnosis experts, we can have an opportunity to discover the visions we all share, and understand more deeply the likely realities that will emerge from them. such knowledge can help us shape our choices with greater awareness, skill and wisdom.
in addition to what occurs in the seminar and workshop sessions, we especially look forward to the atmosphere of warmth and friendship that emerges by working, dining, networking, and simply being together.
we guarantee you will find this convention to be an enriching, rewarding experience, personally and professionally, for years to come.
each year we have a sellout crowd and expect as many to join us this year. don’t be disappointed – make your hotel reservation and register today. we look forward to seeing you this summer at the convention in marlborough, massachusetts.

president
