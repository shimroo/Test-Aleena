craving anthropologie



























an obsession, have to have it, definitely want to live there!  a gal who spends way too many lunch hours at anthropologie--browsing, making my wish list, inspired, charmed, teased, of course i have to leave with something.. anything!  ahhh..now i can go back to work, i've had my fix.

i started this blog back in oct 2005 (wow, is that possible?) because i needed to be inspired again. working in a field that had involved no creativity to say the least, i loved the visual feast of beauty that anthro gave me. it was so very needed as i sat among my very gray cubicle walls.
but i have struggled the last couple of months with the thought of wrapping things up or taking a break. it's really because i can't give this blog the attention it deserves and i hate doing things half heartedly, as i feel i have. and i need to focus on other 'things' right now. so i think it may be time. 



i think what i loved most was the other creative souls i've met through blogging and the interaction with others who shared in my little passion. and i've enjoyed every bit of it.



yes, i still adore anthro and you will definitely find me swooning over anthro finds at my personal blog, i'm sure of that.



i will keep up the links here and share links to new anthro blogs, maybe there will be an official one. who knows. 



you can still email me and chat about anthro any time!!!





thank you anthropologie for the inspiration! you are the best at what you do! and thanks to all of you who joined me along the way!!!




best, 



jennifer
