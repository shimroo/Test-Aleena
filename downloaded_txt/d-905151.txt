i received a herter gift certificate for my birthday and decided to have matt re-string my big baby taylor. he also made some adjustments and now it sounds better than ever and the action has improved as well! and i found some awesome sheet music (including this is me from the greatest showman) for my digital piano. iâ€™ll definitely be back!
