chasing tyson
with his outsized personality and ferocious punches, mike tyson cast a commanding shadow over boxing in the 1980s and ’90s.  even when “iron mike” was in prison, the heavyweight division belonged to him.  meanwhile, like ahab patiently waiting to reel in his giant whale, evander holyfield endured years of delay for the opportunity to take down tyson. though he captured the heavyweight title when he knocked out buster douglas, the prevailing view of the mild-mannered holyfield was that he was a journeyman – the heavyweight champion, but never a truly great one.though holyfield dramatically lost and recaptured the heavyweight crown, and then lost it again, even he understood that his career would ultimately be defined by how he stood up to tyson – if he ever got his chance.  by the time of their much-hyped and oft-delayed heavyweight title bout in november of 1996, holyfield was 34 and considered past his prime.  four years younger, tyson was heavily favored to be standing over another meek and easily vanquished opponent at the end.  instead, we got two of the sport’s most memorable fights – but for very different reasons.

spyball
fdr once said to the head of his spy agency, "give my regards to the catcher." why would the president of the united states say that? because "the catcher" was moe berg, who spent 15 seasons in the majors before taking up espionage for the government.in "spyball," directors christina burchard and daniel newman tell the extraordinary story of berg, a linguist, lawyer and .243 lifetime hitter whom casey stengel called "the strangest man to ever play the game of baseball." educated at princeton and columbia, he was friends with babe ruth, albert einstein and the marx brothers, but it was his loyalty to his country that truly distinguished him.his surreptitious filming of tokyo during a 1934 baseball tour helped prepare the doolittle raid bombing of that city during world war ii, and the intelligence he provided at the end of that war assured fdr that the americans were ahead of the nazis in the race to create an atomic bomb.adding to the appeal of this documentary is the dramatic narration by another eccentric former player bill "the spaceman" lee.
