kind words










what junior tournaments should be.the little mo tournament has become the highlight of our year and somewhat of a family tradition over the past few years. the little mo tournaments are an example of what junior tennis should be. the emphasis on sportsmanship, respect, and the dignity of the game of tennis is what sets your tournaments apart from the rest. our family very much appreciates what your organization is doing to raise the bar of junior tennis.

once in a lifetime experience.i wanted to send you my warm congratulations on organizing such a fine tournament which allowed jonathan to play such great players from around the world. this has, without doubt, been a 'once in a lifetime' experience for us both. jonathan delighted in playing such talented kids and i loved to watch the great standard of play and sportsmanship by the competitors.

my first big tournament!i remember the "little mo" being my first big tournament! i had many long three-set battles with guys i still keep in touch with today....and although i never won the "little mo", it helped me realize how much i love this game and helped me stay motivated to keep playing and improving. i could not have asked for a better childhood and it all started with the "little mo".

playing such talented boys landon's age was truly priceless.luke and landon had a great time this weekend at little mo. luke loved the opportunity to sing at opening ceremonies and landon couldn't have enjoyed the entire experience more. to play such talented boys his age was truly priceless and made a lasting impression. the tournament, from sectionals to nationals, has offered my family much joy and we cannot wait for next year!

the little mo west regionals experience was priceless. our friends have mentioned that the experiences that their children had shared at the little mo circuit were priceless to their young adolescent development. i can honestly say that the time that my family spent at morgan's run this past weekend surpassed all of my expectations. the quality of jr tennis was good but what sticks out and is more important to me was how the children interacted off the court. it was really nice seeing new long-lasting friendships be made.

the "little mo" experiencelittle mo is such a unique experience for the junior players, giving them their first taste of a big stage event. the tournaments are run so professionally, with the staff going above and beyond to make the experience exceptional. there is an attentiveness and care that sets the stage for high quality and fair play matches. it always feels like such a privilege to play little mo. with high emphasis on good sportsmanship and friendship, the experience goes beyond tennis. our two kids have so much fun collecting the little mo coins, meeting other players, and doing the first match gift exchange. these are lifelong memories being made that will always have a positive imprint on their tennis experience. tennis comes with so much pressure and can be a very lonely and isolated sport. little mo allows for highly competitive and big stakes tennis but also provides a fun and happy environment that keeps the kids’ spirits up no matter the results. it’s a true joy to play little mo!

learning sportsmanshipmy son has learned so much from this tournament. he’s made a lot of friends and has developed a strong sense of sportsmanship, all thanks to "little mo". this organization plays a significant role in the growth of young tennis players. they offer encouraging trophies, travel grants, and prize money, which is quite rare for a non-profit organization.
