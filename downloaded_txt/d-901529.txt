welcome tode torenprivate cellar
welcome to de toren private cellar

from the beginning, the vision was to create something truly exceptional. by embracing the best of  the old and blending it with the best of the new, our approach over the past decades has remained to  continuously evolve in our pursuit of excellence. driven by a pioneering spirit, we sought to  reinterpret the concept of bordeaux wines and simultaneously became south africa's very first  gravity-fed cellar. renowned for our exceptional care and making use of only the gentlest processes,  both in vineyard and cellar, the result of this labour of love is a range of spectacular wines, awarded  with many honorary titles over the years. the estate and manor house lovingly refurbished to ensure  experiences as extraordinary as the wines. it is thus with great pleasure that we welcome you to this  undiscovered stellenbosch hilltop we call home, one where a world of exceptional experiences awaits  you.

home to ancient soils

terroir
terroir
de toren wines are an expression of some of the world's most ancient granite soils, originating from mother material dating back 540 million years. thus, setting the stage for something truly exceptional.












ancient soilsmake for wines of distinction
ancient soils make for wines of distinction
in geological terms, the coastal regions of the western cape, which include stellenbosch, consist of extremely old geological formations that underwent long periods of exposure to weathering, without extensive covering by younger material of glacial or alluvial epochs, resulting in viticulture being practiced on some of the oldest soils in the world. the result is bordeaux-style wines of unique expression with complexity, depth and power that are a true expression of the land itself and unique coastal location.
