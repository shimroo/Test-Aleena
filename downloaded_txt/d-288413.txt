grab the mic at museumnacht!

let’s talk about a kind of love we don’t celebrate enough. not the kind you see in movies or hear about in love songs, but something deeper - the love we show to ourselves.
if you’re a poet or spoken word artist with a story to share, we’d love for you to join us on stage. to apply, simply fill out the form below and submit your work - just make sure it reflects our open mic theme, the love i forgot to give.
