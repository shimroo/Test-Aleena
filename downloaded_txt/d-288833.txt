be smart don't think

a.d. records cd adr01, 2003 (48:58)


 = a  h a i k u   r e v i e w  =

  minty fresh hip-hop,

  cool-jazzy funk, reggae grooves –

  but me no expert


  glenn brooks






james mathus and his knockdown society:

national antiseptic 

linda dailey paulson
from the opening tune, you can tell that, like much of the squirrel nut zippers fare, this is good time party music.









eddie & frank thomas:

angels on the backroads:
volume 1 - memphis to clack's store
volume 2 - robinsonville to the valley store

glenn brooks
a unique project whose goal, in part, is to transport the listener to highway 61, the blues highway, where blues history was made

volumes 3 & 4 are now out...










dave holland big band:

what goes around

dan macintosh
it rotates in a distinctly predatory motion, like animals circling for the kill









evan johns and the hillbilly soul surfers:

moontan

linda dailey paulson
in short: psychobilly meets surf for a musical rumble.









clothesline revival:

of my native land

glenn brooks
squeaky porch swing meets a scratchy fiddle band









dave carter & tracy grammer:

drum hat buddha

dan macintosh
nope, this album ain't about ex-hippies crying in their beers while slumped over acoustic guitars.









the gourds:

shinebox

linda dailey paulson
seems to be prime evidence the gourds are at their best when interpreting other folks' songs.
