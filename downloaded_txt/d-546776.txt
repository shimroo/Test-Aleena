            albertan and perennial favorite steve pineo and his band, along with the heebee jeebies will be our closing act.
        

            we are anticipating a festive atmosphere on this night, as the band will be performing an elvis tribute, featuring the heebee jeebies - on horns and singing the jordanaires parts. (no doubt steve will play a few of his own tunes as well.)
        

            sing along, dance, laugh, cry... just be sure to put on your party hats, and celebrate with us on this our grand finale show!
