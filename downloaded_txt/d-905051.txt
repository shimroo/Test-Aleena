rule engine with machine learning



data is knowledge!
in this age of machine learning, good knowledge can be extracted from good data
by automatic means using machine learning algorithms. good data can result in good 
predictive models that can be used as important risk management tools.


rule-based model evaluation with event processing (rme-ep) is a very powerful expert system shell rule engine, incorporating predictive modeling machine learning algorithms, such as neural network, self organizing maps, decision tree, regression, time series, statistical functions, and so on. it combines rule engine with machine learning. for more;
