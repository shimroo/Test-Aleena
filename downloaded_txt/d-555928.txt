welcome to wstcthe washington ski touring club is a seattle-based, recreation-oriented club of about 180 members who organize nordic ski trips -- track skiing in groomed areas, and backcountry skiing in ungroomed terrain at various ski levels. we love to ski and encourage you to join us! we start the ski season with a potluck dinner and usually have 3 or 4 evening meetings with an interesting program. with membership, a person gets access to our website including discussion forums to share information on snow conditions, provide trip reports, announce trip plans, sell gear, and post photos.
