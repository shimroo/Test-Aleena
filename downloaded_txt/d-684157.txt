 our achievements
"the most promising tourism star award for pioneering 
                        efforts in building up a vibrant hostel scene in singapore, 
                        serving the needs of backpackers." - singapore tourism board
"best 
                        hostel ever!" - this ain't no blurb, it's straight 
                        up gospel. the inncrowd hostel singapore clinched the 
                        singapore tourism award 
                        with the support given to us by all our friends and bunkies. 
                        it's a fantastic feeling to receive well wishes from all 
                        over the world, even fellow hosteliers within singapore 
                        and the region. thank you!
conveyed 
                        in my speechlet during the awards, as much as it's about 
                        balancing a business, we're here more to build the backpacking 
                        culture and the friendships that follow. 
we’re 
                        incredibly proud to have won the singapore tourism awards 
                        (incidentally, this is a first for the hostelling scene 
                        in singapore. yay!). 
the 
                        satisfaction comes not from polishing the plaque or the 
                        dusting of the citation. it stems from having achieved 
                        our aim of having set the standards and precedents for 
                        the backpacking culture in singapore. 
sure, 
                        we’re proud of our awards, but, the reason this 
                        award means so much to us is because it results directly 
                        from our bunkies' feedback. it’s one thing for the 
                        industry to say we excel at our job, but it’s the 
                        piece of pie to know our bunkies and friends think we 
                        do, and that's where it counts.
we 
                        feel even more pride in the fact that the inncrowd has 
                        propagated worldwide mostly by the word of mouth. taking 
                        pride of place is still our 
                        guestbook. it lays testament to the direction our 
                        bunkies and us have charted for the hostel, together. 
                        
so 
                        what does this all really mean? nada. why? simply because 
                        this award is not about me. this award belongs to "us". 
                        "us" being people who have sacrificed for the 
                        hostel. "us" being the people who keep the hostel 
                        running like the atomic clock. "us" being the 
                        flesh and blood behind the hostel. "us" being 
                        friends of the inncrowd. "us" being the friends 
                        who believe in the inncrowd. and last but not least, all 
                        of us who seek the experiences that travel provides.

                            the roads adjacent to us that heads downtown, but 
                            there's a slight problem, we are downtown.

                              what we would want ourselves. like a ferrari, a

you'd have to see it to know. it's a stroke

skylights 
                              and full height windows allows natural light to

                              by the rustle of plastic bags or the un-zipping 
                              of bags when you're crashing, or if you're the one 
                              packing for that matter.

                              and quiet.
cleanliness 
                              is next to godliness. the peeps who run this pad 
                              stays here. the owner stays here. the people who 
                              cleans and keeps this pad in order stays here. this 
                              is their home. go figure.

we're on facebook!



 
 the 
                          tribe has spoken.
we 
                          started running of what we thought to be the backpackers 
                          hostel from ground zero. totally without experience, 
                          zilch, nada. just from our own experiences, ideals and 
                          expectations. more than that, we also relied on the 
                          feedback and suggestions of our bunkies and thus, we 
                          constantly evolve. 
the 
                          consolation that the buildings belongs to us makes it 
                          less of a pain for us to outfit it the way we want, 
                          the way we expect it to be. the decision was the easy 
                          bit.
the 
                          tricky bit was planning for noise control and additional 
                          unobtrusive security measures, but that's done now, 
                          it's all good. 
little 
                          india historic district
it's 
                          great to see an area evolve by itself. the streetscape 
                          of historic 
                          little india has seen changes over the past months. 
                          more street stalls, a proliferation of local eateries, 
                          pubs. it's just springing up all over!
right 
                          next door, we've got countryside, derived from 
                          love and comfort food. it's cafe fare with a twist. 
                          the usual grill works, nachos, chips and cheese, pastries, 
                          cakes and coffee galore. throw in your daily dose of 
                          macchiato, latte, iced mocha and stuff, made with real 
                          coffee beans and you shell out less than half the clams 
                          you would at the regular coffee chains. lunch and dinner 
                          menus rotate between local stuff, most of which are 
                          'branded'. twice as good, half as cheap, literally.
our 
                          regular barbys are held together now as they throw in 
                          a slight panache to the whole affair with tables, chairs, 
                          candlelights and more importantly, they've got beer! 
                          we use to rough it out on the floors or wherever we 
                          can find a spot to park our ass.30 
                          seconds crawl from us will bring alkys to the myriads of watering holes. but 
                          i have to clarify, making your way back through the 
                          thick alcoholic haze will take you slightly longer, 
                          that is if you can still catch your bearings. it's a 
                          drinking hole with a beer garden in little india. backpackers 
                          with affiliations gets discounts off list, pick up a 
                          discount coupon from us if you don't.
we 
                          know alcohol isn't the cheap in singapore and it does 
                          crack the budget, but we gurantee, it will be here, 
                        let's just say it's for the good of mankind. 
that 
                          my friends, is exactly how seriously we take our feedback. 
                        
 
the 
                          hostel evolves
being 
                          quite happy with our country club styled showers and 
                          toilets in ver 2.0, we decided to just go ahead with 
                          the building works at our campbell location. apparently, 
                          it scores big time with our girl bunkies. although it's 
                          been only just over a year since we opened our doors 
                          to welcome friends from the world over, renovation to 
                          the inncrowd ver 1.0 @campbell is along the way. 

















friends
you 
                          can't help but feel a loss when people who walk in as 
                          strangers (yes, andy was strange.) leave as friends. 
                          blinking back tears, we bade farewell to andy (aka gecko 
                          aka dj aspec, and more recently aka babs her vajesty) 
                          this afternoon. 
having 
                          been with us since december, this wee scottish lad never 
                          failed to offer a cheerful smile, a patient ear or sausage 
                          and mash. discounting the fact that i have to wake up 
                          earlier than usual, i will miss him, and his bacon sandwich. 
                          he happens to be one of the very colourful character 
                          that makes running a backpackers' hostel meaningful.

life 
                          is great.
the 
                          plus of running a hostel
i 
                          kinda like expected something like this to happen sooner 
                          or later. when peeps meet, talk, all sortsa things happen. 
                          occasionally, you hear snippets of conversations. i 
                          was privy to one last night which went:
boy: 
                          "wacha doin tamarr" (thick aussie accent.)
                          girl: "dunno."
                          boy: "yeah, me neither."
                          girl: "think it will rain?"
                          boy: "dunno."
                          girl: "yeah, me neither."
                          boy: "wattabout if it don't rain, we git married?
                          girl: "ok, if it don't rain."
                          boy: "duh, ok, it's sorted then. thanks."
                          girl: "you're welcome."
my 
                          friends, it did not rain today, and yes, we had our 
                          first marriage proposal at the inncrowd, and of course 
                          our first acceptance. i was scratching my head over 
                          this. methinks i was more in shock than the person proposed 
                          to. but i also think that in any relationship, effort 
                          is also necessary to keep the boat afloat. so if the 
                          chemistry is sizzling, and you feel that it's probably 
                          the way to go, i'd say go for it! frivolous it is not. 
                          if i decide to spend the rest of my life with someone, 
                          i'd like the rest of my life with someone special to 
                          start as soon as possible.
 
                          our walking tour
 
                          ping took the bunkies on a temple walk starting with 
                          the very beautiful abdul gafoor mosque two minutes walk 
                          away. i recently learned that the land on which it stands 
                          on has a 'wakaf' (i think, i'll double check) status. 
                          meaning that it's permanently designated as a religious 
                          site of historic significance. the bunkies were treated 
                          to an extra long, extra detailed tour courtesy of the 
                          vice-chairman himself on the grand premise. the mosque 
                          started off as a building by itself. a manager of a 
                          law firm took the initiative of building little huts 
                          and shops on the land around the mosque, rented them 
                          out, and the proceeds then went into the refurbishment 
                          of the present day spectacle. 
during 
                          the walk to the chinese and hindu temples at waterloo, 
                          our bunkies were introduced to chinese 'chow chien' 
                          (fortune telling), ice cream sandwich in colored bread 
                          and also gave offerings of incense to the gods. muslim 
                          mosque, hindu and chinese temple, let's just call it 
                          insurance.
after 
                          a bit 'o break back at the hostel, it was my turn to 
                          lead them on a culinary quest. we headed through the 
                          thriving thieves market to the coffeeshop. at 
                          this point in time, i have to make one thing sure from 
                          today onwards, food is meant to be eaten. everyone had 
                          a field day taking oodles of pix of the double broiled
