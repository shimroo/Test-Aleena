artist & writer residency





vermont studio center (vsc) was founded by artists in 1984. we welcome writers and artists for residencies in johnson, vermont, and host programs and events. our mission is to provide studio residencies in an inclusive, international community, honoring creative work as the communication of spirit through form. our buildings, many of them historic vermont landmarks, overlook the gihon river in the northern green mountains.for four decades, our residency program has offered residents and the general public an opportunity to engage with global creative communities. we invite visiting writers and artists from around the world to join us during our residencies to mentor residents, present readings, facilitate craft talks, and give lectures that are open to the public.
