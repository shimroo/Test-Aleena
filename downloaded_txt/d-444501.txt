our mandate
camping in ontario, is a member-based association, comprised of small businesses located throughout the province of ontario. our association was started in 1969 by a group of campground owners that wanted to improve their businesses. while the way we do things has changed over the years, our mission remains the same: 

"as a vital and active stakeholder in tourism, camping in ontario supports member campgrounds in the province of ontario by educating campground owners, marketing camping in ontario to the general public and advocating to government."
