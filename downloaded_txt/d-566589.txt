  hear it from our customers!based on 1234 reviews.see some of the reviews here 2/17/2025received in reasonable time packaged correctly 2/17/2025the organic bean bag covers were perfect for my two little ones! i filled them with kapok fill, so i can feel comfortable that they are not being exposed to anything ** and unnatural. these bean bag covers have held up well, so far! my little ones have been jumping onto them constantly! 2/16/2025the weight of the waterproof cover for my down comforter is heavy!  very heavy. i would have liked to have had the fact disclosed. it is quite heavy at night. hard to make bed. it is such that i actively wonder if i will continue to use it. 2/16/2025great products, great customer service. 1/29/2025we have use white lotus products in our home for over 20 years and will continue forever. 1/28/2025easy ordering, quick shipping.  love my new pillow!! 1/27/2025i love your products. thank you! 1/25/2025all was great: customer service, product, delivery. thanks! 1/23/2025i have been a repeat customer over the past 2 years and have referred white lotus to several friends and family. i value mattresses built with natural and sustainable materials with design geared towards supporting the human body well. white lotus does exactly that ! their cotton boulder mattresses are incredible and i love that all pillows and mattresses have cotton waterproof covers too. the white lotus team including the delivery process is super customer friendly and prompt. i feel comforted knowing our backs are well supported with the firm mattresses and that we are not inhaling harmful chemicals found in other products in market. 
- pravleen 1/22/2025this is exactly what i was looking for.  i have been experimenting with sleeping on a firm surface. after deciding there are huge benefits, i began looking for something to replace the multiple blankets on the floor. this massage mat is the perfect replacement and will allow me to customize my bed with it, along with plywood, for the perfect sleep surface
