handheld and portable computer club






				hpcc is a voluntary, independent body run by and for users of
				handheld and portable computers and calculators.
			


				for over 40 years, the club has been helping members
				get the most from their hewlett packard equipment and further
				the exchange of information and ideas.
			

				while most members' main interest is in the hp range of models, the club is
				happy to discuss other models too, at meetings, through the club
				journal - datafile, and on these web pages.
			


				hpcc is not supported by hewlett packard or any other commercial organisation;
				its activities are funded and undertaken by its members.
