eye on the night sky




tuesday, february 18, 2025

today:
the waning moon doesn’t rise until a few minutes after midnight, allowing dark evening skies to reveal the splendors of the milky way arched over the top of the sky.  early this evening, in the midst of the milky way and directly overhead near 7:20 pm, the star capella sparkles as the 4th brightest star we can see.



 
detailed eye on the night sky.
