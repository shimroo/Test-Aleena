mike g




absolutely amazing tours and owners!!! awesome tour with paul! because of lots of snow we thought we would have to miss seeing sequoia and kings canyon but an all day tour with paul saved our trip. he was a wonderful tour guide, very knowledgeable, entertaining and showed us things we would have never seen on our own.






pam l




if 10 stars was an option, that’s what i’d rate it! best tour ever! it was so nice to be picked up and dropped off at our lodging. he was prompt and so very attentive. we learned so much about this beautiful area.






carden222




this was such a great way to see the park, steve was very knowledgeable, interesting and really enjoyed telling us the history of the park. both my teenage children loved the tour and we saw things we never would of managed to find ourselves.






kellie g




very knowledgeable tour and friendly guide. my family had a tour with paul who took us to kings canyon. it was a lovely tour, paul was very knowledgeable and friendly, and helped make it a great day. it was well worth the money and a wonderful way to see king’s canyon.






isabelle c




a perfect day, fun and sooo informative! highly recommended! it was just an all-around informative and truly fascinating experience. this all day tour was exactly what we hoped it would be.






trisha




amazing!!! my family and i learned a lot about the giant sequoia trees and the national forest. the scenery was gorgeous and just truly breathtaking. the best was that our guides could go places that we couldn’t really drive to on our own.






verity s




amazing tour in the middle of winter. paul was a thoughtful and knowledgeable guide of this beautiful region. we were able to see sights that not many people see when they visit the park for the day and paul (our guide) gave us a great insight into the park itself. thank you for a great day! would highly recommend to everyone.






gene r




great half day tour! we thouroughly enjoyed our half day tour thanks to our guide, jean paul. he was friendly and knowledgable and made our tour a great experience! i would highly recommend this tour as there is alot of information you would not get if you see the various sites yourself.
