                            wild innocence




                            this book is definately one to purchase! from the characters, to the story line, to the ending; all of it kept me wanting more. it was original, yet still had that connection to real life and real world situations. it had just the right amount of comedy intertwined with the drama that unfolds in the story. this was an exceptional story told in an exceptional way. i can't wait to read the other books by this author. very well written!

                            the black divorce




                            moody holiday is one of the most imaginative, talented writers i have come across in my career. she not only has a way of telling a story, she tackles issues that have been taboo with grace. her books are not just a good read, they're fire!
