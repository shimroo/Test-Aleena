who's hands do you trust to hold guns?





so obama keeps telling me i can't trust the people i know to have guns. they are going to end up killing themselves or commit crime with them. 

i know several people with guns. i don't think any of them are about to kill themselves or anyone else. pretty sure none of them is thinking of violent crime.
i think i would rather trust the people i know and accept on faith that most people who have guns are just like them. 
so no thank you mr. obama. i have considered your presentation and found it be false. i will continue to trust the american people.

 not you.

why you don't want to know the truth.






the real reason americans do not want to know the truth and will continue to fight each other.demonstrated by a look at tallahassee.government is the central focus of tallahassee's economy. the city of tallahassee employees 2,900 full time workers. that is just the city. in 2010 there was an estimated 60,100 government workers in tallahassee. as of july 2011 the population of tallahassee was 182,965. you can do the math.think of the number of jobs dependent on these workers incomes. the number of houses, cars, etc that these workers buy.to say the government is completely corrupt, that both republicans and democrats are on the same team, that the whole system needs to go is to say that 60,100 people need to fight against their own jobs here in tallahassee. it's saying the jobs these people hold have a good chance of being corrupt, broken, and useless. who want's to say that about themselves or believe it if it were presented? who want's to kick that wasp nest and stop the money flowing to their community?what about welfare? the number of americans on it is growing. this must be true of tallahassee too.so we fight each other over issues that don't matter for freedoms that are already ours to have. somehow we have forgotten that in the drama of tv reality which tells us everyone not like us is wrong so divide and fight, but i digress.the real reason nobody wants to know the truth. nobody wants to see that both democrats and republicans are the same team, with the same agenda, pushing the same goals, for the same people, is cause we are all to dependent on the hand that feeds us.this is called a "nanny state".the government will protect us all to death."peace and security"

war is profit





war is profit. international bankers own the manufactures of the guns american's are buying right now. they make the guns the cops and the military carry. the bullets the guns fire are made by corporations owned by international bankers.the bankers have way more money invested in a police state and thus the public get's less powerful weapons but go ahead and buy them up and kill each other.war is profit.

do not speak to fools, for they will scorn your prudent words





so i think we all should stop fighting each other and start fighting the bankers and the corporations they own that run all the governments of the world and fight all the wars.

problem is, i'm a christian. in today's society that is not acceptable and thus we can't stand together. isn't that true? wonder how many people completely dismiss anything i say because they know i believe the bible to be true?i wonder how many people decided that nothing i have to say matters at all cause if i believe in god i must have a screw lose in my head and thus nothing i say can be right or true.the world is all dividing and fighting each other over anything and everything. i believe we should stop. but there is an animosity growing, a darkness that is working, it's behind the international bankers that own all the corporations that make all the weapons and broadcast all the media that runs all the governments and their military's and fights all the wars (cause nothing is more profitable to an international banker than war) and removes god from the public conscious making people believe they have informed scientific fact behind their carefully brainwashed, er, i mean taught decision to reject creation.

i don't think we will unite and stop what is coming cause i don't think god's plan can be delayed any longer. i believe he has a firm date set we do not know, but that date is coming very soon. 

and then "saith the lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to god"

come, let us reason together.





has anyone noticed it's impossible to have a discussion on any topic of any substance anymore without animosity and slander? 
it's like as soon as somebody says anything at all that somebody else doesn't agree with it turns into personal attacks full of anger.

why is that? 

i would like to suggest it is because the vast majority of opinions today are formed from the tv. people like to think they have their own opinions, their own thought out views on the world, when if fact they are just repeating something they saw on tv... and tv tells them to be angry about it cause they are right and all those other moonbats are wrong and deserve only your contempt.

wake up!
