happy 2023! and i'm moving to substack...





happy new year! i hope this finds you all healthy, and looking forward to 2023. i'm just back from a few weeks of rest in oregon and california with the family, and now back in vienna getting ready for a new year of trail running, triathlons, marathons, and travel adventure. (quinn [11], christi, sophie [16], and me enjoying a laugh in our us-adopted hometown of santa barbara in dec, 2023)i will be blogging more often this year, and am switching to substack for publishing. i find substack is much better for comments and chats (and getting rid of spam comments), so i'm hoping it can help this blog return to more intimate roots. it's still all free, and i'll keep this web site here for posterity. you'll need to subscribe below to get email updates moving forward. i hope you will follow along! or even better, i hope to see you on the trails. - scott
