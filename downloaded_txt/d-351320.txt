choosing a bar stool






there are all kinds of different styles of stools, to match any decorating theme.  from traditional wooden stools with solid seats ,
to contemporary metal frames, thereâs something for all situations.  backless bar stools are a good space-saving choice as they can be
tucked under the counter when not in use.  swivel stools are great for social, busy areas and for getting on and off easily without needing
to be moved.

bar stools can be made from various sorts of metal or wood, each with its own characteristics.  which type of frame is best depends on
aesthetics, what would fit in with the character of your room and practicalities such as how easy it is to keep clean. lightweight and durable
aluminum is a popular material for kitchen bar stools that get lots of daily use.  wrought iron is highly decorative and can be used to make
a stylistic statement.  wood such as oak or cherry is sturdy, durable and has timeless appeal. it can come in a range of finishes such as
distressed or antiqued.

outdoor bar stools made from robust, weather-resistant wood such as teak or rust-proof metal, can be a great addition to an outdoor
entertaining area.  similarly, if you own a bar or restaurant, commercial bar stools that are built to stand up to the rigors of constant
use are a wise buy.  with custom bar stools you can select your own combination of colored fabric, vinyl or leather, as well as the
finish.
whatever type of bar stool you're looking for, we're sure you'll find it at getbarstools.com.
