bibliography background about kris


the klamath resource information system (kris) 
      pulls together maps, data tables, charts, photographs and bibliographic 
      resources into an easy-to-use, pc-based computer program. for any designated 
      watershed, kris organizes information relevant to fisheries and water quality 
      so that it can be shared quickly and easily among agencies, private land 
      owners and citizens. 

kris projects can be obtained on cds, free of 
      charge, or can be browsed as web pages by selecting a project title at left. 
      see a map of kris projects to aid your 
    selection. 
these projects were built thanks to the cooperation of many individuals 
	  and organizations. kris projects can be easily updated as new information 
	  becomes available.
