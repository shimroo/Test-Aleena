breakthrough therapeutics 

focus areas 

innovation inspired by challenges




 





 












endo is boldly innovating in pursuit of transforming health and health system burdens.




 






through our long-standing work in endocrinology, orthopedics, and urology, as well as in hospital systems and with retail generic medications, we have developed an unmatched understanding of those we serve. we will never stop learning how to make a real difference in people's lives. 




 




 




















 






pediatric endocrinology 

the endocrine system is a collection of glands that controls many of the body’s essential functions. when they work properly, they keep the human body operating as expected. when they malfunction, one result can be central precocious puberty (cpp).
cpp is puberty that occurs much earlier than what’s considered normal. this rare disease can be incredibly disruptive to a child’s life and stressful for caregivers, plus it can lead to long-term effects if not addressed.
endo is dedicated to meeting the needs of children and families affected by cpp. we aim to improve outcomes for children affected by early-onset puberty through our research and development efforts, collaborations with healthcare professionals, support for patient/caregiver advocacy groups (human growth foundation, magic foundation) and professional societies (pediatric endocrinology nursing society, pediatric endocrinology society), and caregiver resources.




 




 




















 






orthopedics 

orthopedic medicine focuses on the musculoskeletal system—the skeleton and all the parts that connect to it, including bones, muscles, joints, ligaments, and tendons. orthopedic conditions can impact people’s mobility and, by extension, their quality of life. think of common orthopedic issues like arthritis, fractures, sports injuries, and back problems.
endo’s long-standing work in this field started with dupuytren’s contracture, a hand condition that results in the formation of a rope-like cord that pulls fingers toward the palm and may get worse over time. an estimated 17 million americans* have dupuytren’s contracture,1,2 making it difficult for them to use their hands for daily activities—even simple tasks such as placing their hands in their pockets, putting on gloves, or shaking hands.
endo continues to conduct research focused on orthopedic conditions, including dupuytren’s contracture, and we partner with the american society for surgery of the hand, the american association for hand surgery, and other orthopedic organizations to support their patient advocacy and educational work. through all these efforts, we strive to help people overcome challenges and live the lives they want.

urology & men’s health 

a range of conditions can affect the urinary tract system and male reproductive system. in urology, the patient experience and the patient–provider relationship are critical. treatment and care must be personalized and tailored to a person’s unique journey, needs, and preferences.
our commitment to men’s health has positioned us as a leader in the space. we are passionate about the health issues affecting men today, including hypogonadism, or low testosterone, and peyronie’s disease, a buildup of fibrous scar tissue that causes a curvature deformity of the penis.
due to the personal nature of men’s urologic health conditions like these, men may be too uncomfortable to speak up and get help. our dedication to these patients drives research and development endeavors, educational initiatives, and patient support. endo is a long-time supporter and partner of medical and scientific organizations, such as the sexual medicine society of north america, the american urological association, urogpo, the large urology group practice association, and the society of urologic nurses and associates, and we collaborate with urologists and advanced practice providers to understand their needs and their patients.

our ready-to-administer (rta) and ready-to-use (rtu) products, available through our trudelivery® platform, streamline hospital operations by eliminating the need for preparation time or transfer before patient administration. this can reduce preparation time, enhance convenience and workflow, and minimize potential preparation errors. all these advantages support quality care for patients in hospitals, clinics, and home health and long-term care systems.
