a story of an agency...


founded in 1987 by lori perkins, a former newspaper publisher and editor, the l. perkins agency specializes in many different genres with six agents representing approximately 100 authors to the publishing industry. the agency also has agents in many foreign territories and works with an established film/television agency to maximize exposure for our clients. in 2010, the agency broke new ground by being the first agency to hire a literary agent who worked exclusively in the digital marketplace. to this day, the l. perkins agency works hard to identify new publishing venues and makes it a priority to help our authors stay ahead of the curve.
 
ï»¿the l. perkins agencyâs five acquiring agents have a diverse range of tastes and are currently looking for material in a wide spectrum of genres and subjects.
 
we are always searching for exciting new voices, and we look forward to the possibility of working with you.

ben grange


agent


ben started out at a small publishing company in salt lake city, ut and proceeded to do internships at three literary agencies before working as the assistant at the jabberwocky literary agency. he decided he wanted to be an agent sometime along the line, and is happily growing an amazing list of clients.
 
his tastes gravitate towards middle grade fiction, and he is particularly on the lookout for exceptional author-illustrators who write middle grade or young adult. he sometimes gets the inkling to read a great ya sci-fi or fantasy,  particularly weird or slightly dark stories (ã  la the raven boys by maggie stiefvater). thanks to his time at jabberwocky, he also loves epic fantasy and science fiction, and although his focus is on middle grade and young adult, he won't say no to a great fantasy or sci-fi. he is also interested in pop culture non-fiction for authors with established platforms.
 
ben is closed to all queries except graphic novel submissions. if you have a graphic novel, please send ben your query, along with 15 sample script pages (with illustrations, if you have them) and a full outline. 









maximilian ximenez


agent


maximilian ximenez grew up within the new york publishing industry. prior to joining the l. perkins agency, he worked at blizzard entertainment, creators of the popular warcraft, starcraft, and diablo video game franchises. he is a strong believer in publishing and narrative as a central pillar of franchise and transmedia development.
 
maximilian is actively pursuing clients for both fiction and nonfiction works. in fiction, he is actively pursuing science fiction, fantasy, horror and thrillers, particularly cyberpunk and neo-noir as well as books with a uniquely deconstructive bent. for nonfiction, maximilian is seeking popular science, true crime and books pertaining to arts and trends in developing fields and cultures.
 
maximilianâs clients include two-time new york times bestselling graphic novel author, micky neilson, and lucien soulban, lead writer of the bafta award winning video game far cry 3.
