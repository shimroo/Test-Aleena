3 meetings in 1;
      think of them 
      as a blend of omega, esalen ,transpersonal and nicabm, with biofeedback, 
      story and a great community and fun exhibit hall..
practical, sharing community --- 
      those are the words that set the winter brain meeting apart. attendees 
      come back year after because presenters and attendees share a wealth of 
      practical information that helps make better practitioners and practices.
