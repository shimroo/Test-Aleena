alumni voices


“the faculty and staff are committed to helping students explore their own academic interests, supporting them through research and award applications, and helping them find financial aid and employment opportunities.”

“there is a culture of experimentation, no doubt a vestige of bruce goff, combined with a deep-seeded spirit of pragmatism … this tension is highly productive.”

land acknowledgment
 the university of oklahoma is on the traditional lands of the caddo nation and the wichita and affiliated tribes. this land was also once part of the muscogee creek and seminole nations. it also served as a hunting ground, trade exchange point, and migration route for the apache, cheyenne, comanche, kiowa, and osage nations. today, 39 federally recognized tribal nations dwell in what is now the state of oklahoma as a result of settler colonial policies designed to confine and forcefully assimilate indigenous peoples.
