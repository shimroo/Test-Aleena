managing risk for real estate investors
in february, rocco esposito of esposito insurance group dove deep into the topic of insurance needs for real estate investors. 
our members and guests learned about the types of insurance coverage, insurance for contactors, use of llcs to shield investors from risk, types and locations of properties most difficult to insure, types of insurance companies, and much more. 
rocco made it extremely interactive, answering questions throughout his entire presentation. 
















bill cook's masterclass highlight
what an awesome event we had on january 18th with bill cook, one of the best creative deal structurers in the country!
we cannot thank bill enough for flying in from warm florida to our cold new jersey in january to teach our group!
bill made this seminar so interactive, answering questions throughout his entire class. he showed us how to approach real estate situations with an open mind, whether buying or selling, and how to make seemingly "impossible" deals possible! 
unbelievable value for everyone who attended and rave reviews from our members! 
thank you for making this day very special, bill! we truly hope this event is going to change the lives of all attendees!

i sincerely hope you like what you do, as well as like the people you work with. after all a good part of your life is spent working so you might as well enjoy it. but if you are one of those 5/7ths people, who live for the weekend, and yearn for something better, something you enjoy and can start doing part time, real estate investing may be for you.
there is no business quite like real estate investing. you can control large amounts of property with small amounts of cash and safely leverage your way to real wealth and prosperity.
but you need to do it the right way. educating yourself as to the proper way to structure deals that benefit you and the other parties involved is of vital importance. also learning how to manage and renovate properties is also of the utmost importance.dave corsi, mreia presidentfrom the metro: "are you a 5/7 person?"
