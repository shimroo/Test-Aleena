    learn how opie can power your practice!
  














your end-to-end practice management solution.















communication is everything! in a practice powered by opie, every member of the team uses the same software system to manage and document the care process. this is critical to ensuring an efficient, high-quality experience for every patient that walks through your door.

















clinical care is so much more than fitting an orthotic or prosthetic device. that’s why practices powered by opie rely on o&p-specific clinical forms, integrated outcome measures, searchable code selections, and configurable templates to support every patient encounter. 

















opie fab tracking allows teams to manage the process of device creation to promote efficient timelines, encourage clear communication, and manage necessary documentation.

















everything you and your patients need in one location! order and receive products, track status, and manage your inventory. direct integration with suppliers and manufacturers allows seamless patient-specific documentation. 

















you can’t improve if you don’t know where to focus. opie practices depend on robust reporting capabilities and dashboards with visual metrics that allow micro and macro views of your practice health and opportunities. 

















confidence in your billing practices is critical to success. that’s why auto-posting insurance payments, electronic claims submissions, invoice creation and statements, and waystar integrations are part of opie billing to support the needs of your billing team.

















operational performance in a glance. dashboards and tools with visual displays of your key data to help easily and quickly identify trends that drive the success of your practice.

the customer experience

- del bianco prosthetics and orthotics




“we were one of the first adopters of opie for our practice. the transition was well worth it!  we have just about everything we need in one place. opie is also always adding new features to keep up with the o&p industry. opie has great support, and provides both recorded and real-time learning sessions. i don’t know where to begin on complimenting the various parts of opie and how the software has helped us. the way each piece integrates with the other is amazing. we utilize all but the opie fax. office managers like how the opie wip streamlines everything and makes everyone accountable as to where we are in our patient care. the addition of the opie anywhere has enabled the practitioners and patient advocate personnel to build and strengthen the patient files, without being at their desks/computers, in a hipaa-secure manner. opie reports is helpful and easy, supporting many aspects/projects of the business, most recently documenting our purchases for r&d analyses with one easy report.  we also purchased opie’s “users operations and accreditation policies and procedures” to help guide us in reviewing, updating and documenting our compliance, best practices, and facility accreditation programs. these guidelines made the process so much easier! the billing platform is well recognized in the industry, allowing us to quickly get a new hire (who was already proficient in it) up to speed.  the opie business intelligence platform is incredible, allowing us to continually monitor how well we are doing across many views. not sure what part of opie provides this, we love the quarterly reports automatically sent to us, comparing our practice to others on several  key business processes.  the integration of all this is just outstanding. don’t know how they do it!”

“opie is a powerful resource with just the click of a button. i find the send online verification to be one of the most resourceful user-friendly functions within opie and because of this i am able to verify insurance with ease. that’s just one of opie’s many resources to ensure i have a smooth workday. thank you, opie!”
