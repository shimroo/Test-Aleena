how to find a reputable beagle breeder in nj


 
welcome to new jersey beagle at breezy point.  let me tell you a little about myself and our beautiful beagle family.  we are a small breeding kennel breeding one to two litters a year. we do not mass produce puppies, and we do not ship puppies from one end of the country to the other.  in fact, we do not ship puppies at all.  we work from a waiting list where our families may sometimes have to wait a little longer to get their puppy, knowing quite well they are getting an excellent quality beagle puppy from a reputable breeder
our dogs are happy well loved animals, and we will only sell our puppies to screened, loving families. we take much pride in knowing when our "little ones" leave here they are going to loving, caring homes. our kennels are clean, and our puppies are healthy. we are exactly the type of breeder families look for when buying a puppy.  

we are located in the mountains of northern new jersey. we're about 1 1/2 hours from ny city, and about 2 hours from the princeton area.  we live on 7 beautiful acres of mostly wooded property.  the dogs love the fresh air and wide open space to really let loose.  our kennel is built around a large heated and air conditioned victorian style building where our dogs come in and sleep at night. we have a big fenced-in area,  (60' x 140') so there's lots of room for our dogs to run, play, and get plenty of exercise. 

our puppy nursery is a separate building which is also heated and air conditioned to keep our puppies comfortable during any season of the year.  there the pups live with their mother and litter mates until they are weaned and then ready to leave to begin their new lives with their new families.  the pups are closely monitored as i spend most of my day caring for them and when i'm not there, wireless camera's and internet connections using a webcam keep me right there.  i can also monitor the temperature in the nursery and adjust it as needed.

	 

i've loved the beagle breed my whole life and have dedicated myself to the well being of these beautiful animals.  our dogs are given lots of love and attention and are only bred to produce happy, healthy, playful puppies that you would be proud to have as part of your family.
please feel free to browse through my website and learn about me and my beagle family.  but first i would like to explain that we are reputable breeders. there are a lot of things we don't do to proudly keep that title.  i encourage you to learn more and make an informative decision by reading our breeder's message.
 

we continue to carry on the impressive pedigree's of our show champions
