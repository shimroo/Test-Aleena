     dear donors: 

on august 28th 2024, copi suffered a catastrophic loss of computer equipment at our office.  
	we are in the process of replacing and reconfiguring our ability to properly 
	record donations and send receipts.  however, this process is going to 
	take some time and receipts for the end of august and september will most 
	likely be delayed.  in the meantime, your contributions are being 
	distributed to the ministries that you support.

all automatic 
	contributions (ach, credit card, paypal) are still being processed and 
	checks sent to the office are being recorded.  the delay is in 
	recovering our year-to-date records and ability to generate contribution 
	statements.  rest assured, all financial data related to your donations 
	is secured by our banking partners (we did not retain credit card numbers, 
	bank account information, etc. on our servers).

if you have any 
	questions, please reach out to us.  again, we are a small organization 
	so it may be a day or two before we return your call.  continue to pray 
	that we can quickly overcome this setback.
