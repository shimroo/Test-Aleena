			until the 1970s, french-language comics (a term including comics created in both france and in belgium) were really
			divided into three almost entirely separate industries:

			a) comic strips than ran in the newspapers
			and were almost entirely aimed at an adult (i.e.: grown up) market.

			b) the socially respectable mainstream comics
			aimed at children and published in weekly magazines, such as spirou, tintin, vaillant (retitled pif, and pilote. these
			published only g-rated cartoony or realistic adventures, humorous stories, and virtually no science fiction, a
			genre deemed too intense for children. 

			c) a myriad of cheaper, monthly or bimonthly magazines, sold to satisfy the demand for harder-edged, more violent,
			more fantastic, american-style stories. the publishers of these magazines (aredit/artima, imperia,  lug, aventures &
			voyages, etc.) either translated american, italian and spanish material, or
			produced their own french-made stories. 

			naturally, parents and educators frowned upon these magazines. a law was passed in france in july 1949 to create
			a censorship committee to monitor youth magazines. originally published in a large-size format and in color, most
			of these magazines were, as a result of censorship, forced to go to a pocket-size, black & white format, hence
			their name, the petits formats
			[small formats].
