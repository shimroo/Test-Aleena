	 patch show 6 (2.4)
	 
    


so, here it is... patch show 6.i was specifically told by a fan to "man up" and get it done, so, here it is.there is a guest host this time, josh fletcher, aka kyo kenshin on my forums.  we actually had to record this twice, though, as the first file he tried recording on his end just up and disappeared somehow.  this time i recorded on my end.  the quality should be about the same, as the programs we used to record are similar in function, just his is for windows, mine is for os x.  the original was 3.5 hours long, this one is 2 hours and six minutes long... so 5+ hours of recording!  yay!the overall audio quality, however, might be a little lower than i normally like, as i accidentally transferred the original uncompressed files to 64 kbps mp3 for editing, instead of my normal 192 kbps mp3s for editing.  we'll have to see.  but, i just spent a good chunk of time editing this... and i'm not editing it all over again.  deal with it.  also, for some reason, there was some slight popping during the last segment we recorded, and i don't know why.  also, this puts all the audio to one track, which means we may talk over each other at times.  not much we can do about that without each of us recording separate tracks... but editing that shit is a pain, trust me.no teldrassil music in the beginning, it's long enough.  it just starts right up.  let the ear bleeding commence!actually, i'm typing this as it is exporting... because i am dumb.  so i have another 26 minutes of letting blogger stare me in the face while it exports.  me am smart.  of course, by the time you read this, the audio will be up for download.man, i love fios.. i just uploaded the 58 mb file in under 2 minutes.  <3  of course, my host makes it 60.9 mb... of course, then i screw up the html and people couldn't download the damn podcast for the past 6 hours...damn it! i just discovered why my voice sounded like i was using a different mic... i was using a different mic!  god dammit!  my skype was set to use my isight, not my damn headset. i have no idea why this was... grrrrrrrrrrrrfile size: 60.9 mbrun time: 2:06:50direct downloadflash player:labels: patch show 6

same video, just testing it in itunes again.  after it shows up in itunes, i'll see how it looks there, then get into editing the video podcast. edit: it showed up beautifully in itunes (not showing up on the show page, but if you hit update podcast it is there).  now i know the format to use, and the hosting site.  this means a little out of game recording, then on to full edit mode!direct link

apologies for the audio quality being a bit lower than the last few shows.  my normal mic has a short in it, so had to use an older mic.this episode is all about the changes upcoming in patch 2.3, lots of items to discuss.  had to rerecord the entire show after a program crash, though, so some parts may sound rushed as i had already recorded them once and was a wee bit pissed.be sure to email me, comment here, or comment on the forms!i also apologize for not having a flash player this post... apparently my host's flash player code i used last time no longer works... need to get new code.  going to attempt one here...        powered by podbean.com  hey, it worked!direct download/listen nowrun time: 1:08:05file size: 31 mb

there are a ton of changes coming in 2.3.  i should hopefully have my mic all set soon, so a 2.2 patch show and then a 2.3 upcoming changes show will be in the works.oh, and the in-game voice chat client sucks an ass.so, list the changes you are excited about, and i'll mention them on the show.changes i'm most excited for:zul'aman and new heroic loot potential.leveling changes (maybe i'll finally level up all my under-40 alts).there are places to look for 2.3 notes, such as worldofraids.com and mmo-champion.com.let me know what you want to hear about, and i'll do my best to fit in as much as i can.leave a comment here, on my forums, or email me with your wish list based on the changes for 2.3.

	 save music on the net
	 
    


i'm sure some of you know about the proposed increase to royalties for music played on the net.  this sort of increase has been proposed for a long time, almost always by the riaa itself (ie not the artists).  but now the publishing companies representing the artists have gotten something through that may pass that will increase the current royalty rate paid to the artists by internet radio stations.  the proposed increase, just like the older riaa sponsored increases, is astornomical and will most likely bankrupt smaller internet-only raido stations.the proposed increase is an increase in royalties from anywhere between 300%-1200%.  if it passes, it will go into effect on july 15, and the royalty payments will be retroactive to january of 2006.  this back payment that will be required will amount to potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars, money many smaller internet-only radio stations simply do not have.  even many larger terrestrial radio stations with advertisers who also stream online are considering pulling their net streams because they feel that the price hike is just too much.so, check out the link in the banner below for more information.

	 google video
	 
    


i think i'm addicted to google video.  there is just so much cool and funny shit on there, and a lot of wow vids as well (of course, you can also go to warcraft movies for movies, too, but you don't have to download these to watch them... streaming ftw!!!).i mean, check out this crazy stuff from what appears to be either japanese or chinese tv. also, on an odd note, i am actually starting to use os x's dashboard feature a bit more.  when apple announced dashboard as a feature of os x, i was more like "meh"... but, now that google has put out a blogger widget (os x users can download it directly by clicking here), i can post to my site here without ever having to go to the site... unless there's a ton of text in the post, like this one (that video html is a killer).  my last few posts, though, were all done from my desktop, with no need to be on the blogger site at all.  leave it to google to make something that would make me use a feature of the os i could otherwise care less about...  they might even have a similar tool for the various widget programs available for windows and linux, as well.  hmm, well, i don't see an official blogger/google widget on my search, but i did find one for konfabulator which is available for both windows and mac (i didn't know yahoo bought out konfabulator...)this actually rounds out my google widgets, since i now have a google search bar widget (for when my browser is not open), and a google mail widget (able to check for new messages at a glance, again, no need for a browser open).  os x users can see all three downloads here.ok, must eat.

	 episode 07 is coming... pause these video streams and watch when you want to
	 
    


alachia from wowcast joins me for episode 07.  but, well, there's a ton of editing to do.  we sort of rambled on about other topics at some points... porn, and variations of it, mainly... and i have to cut this thing down in size; we rambled on for around 2 hours.  well, that is as soon as i get the whole thing.see, my laptop's sound card didn't support a feature of audacity that would let me record us over skype... so she had to do the recording on her end.  but, she also had to get up for work, so i have to give her a little time to get the mp3 to me.  probably tonight, though, i'll have the full thing to edit.  some of the bullshit will stay in the podcast, though.  some of it is funny, some of it is just me being, well, a dumbass (like you expect any less).but, i mention a funny as hell wow video i saw in there, so i wanted to let those of you who have not seen it see it.  the video uses wow characters to recreate a song from the musical avenue q, called "the internet is for porn."  (a pattern?  we speak of porn, and a song about porn?  nah, coincidence...)  there are a lot of compression artifacts in it, but, still, you can get the gist. i also mention the female night elf dance, and how it was copied from a french pop star (ok, she's apparently from corsica, originally, before her fans eat into me), named alizée.  i'm posting the videos of the two songs where when she performs them, you can definitely see where the guy who came up with the female night elf dance animation had a serious thing for alizée.  not that i can truly blame him... she is hot.  married, with a kid, but still hot.ironically, each of the songs with the videos below have english versions (i guess to try and break her into the uk charts)... however, the songs were completely re-written for their english versions, and make little sense in english.  basically, they needed to re-write the words so the song lyrics had the same flow in english that they do in français.  and, even though she can sing in english, when you hear the english versions, it really shows she is more comfortable singing these songs in french (though she does do a passable cover of madonna's la isla bonita).the first video is from the song entitled j'ai pas vingt ans (i'm not twenty is the english translation... and yes, she was only 18 when the video was made 3 years ago), and you can see a few elements that were incorporated into the female night elf dance moves.  the guy who made this compilation took shots from the music video, and a bunch of live perfomrances (they all use the same choreography) and put them into this video.  yes, he has way too much time on his hands... and is apparently unhealthily obsessed with her. the second is from the song jen ai marre (i'm fed up is the english translation), and the choreography is only in her live performances of the song, the music video has no choreography.  at about 3:25 into the song, you will definitely see the move incorporated into the female night elf dance... or you are fucking blind. yes, these are in french.  yes, it's pop music.  kind of catchy, but that is what pop music is for... mindless, catchy songs.  and, to all the guys... you don't have to like her voice... just look at her.  obviously the animator did.so, enjoy the eye candy while you wait for episode 07 to come out.  it should only be a few days or so, at the most.

	 slight update
	 
    


i got some new recording software, this is recorded with it... able to reduce hiss noise considerably now.i also got some music files to play for the intro, outro, and during the cast so i don't sound like a npr reject, and there's something else going on in the background.  i hope to have the first podcast ready by this weekend, raids permitting. ;-p
