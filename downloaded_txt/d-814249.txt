 about community youth services
since 1970, community youth services (cys) has
been dedicated to creating a world where every
young person can thrive, feeling safe, supported,
and empowered to reach their full potential. for over
fifty-three years, we have worked with hundreds of
thousands of young people in the south puget sound
area, especially those who need support with stable
housing, family reconnection, a supportive foster
home, and behavioral health and wellness support.  click here to read more…
