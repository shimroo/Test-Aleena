one for the crowd of the old days





'there's a production company that deals exclusively in supplying women to pose as naked corpses for dramas. the basic rate of pay is 8,000 yen for three hours work on a tv show. it pays a bit better if the show is on in the peak ratings period, but never more than 50,000 yen a day,' a tv production company insider tells shukan post. 'to make sure there's the maximum possible extent of realism, it's usually the sickly types who get the corpse work. there have even been some corpse models who've gone on to extremely successful modeling careers.'"
