powder testers and hopper design software





















 






testers and software for powders and bulk solids
powder flow testers and related software since more than 30
                  years.

our testers help you to measure flow properties incl.
                flowability of powders and bulk solids, and to understand powder
                flow, how to avoid flow problems or segregation in hoppers, bins
                and other equipment, how powders can be compared and optimized
                with respect to flowability, and how cohesion, strength, caking
                and wall friction are determining the powder's behavior.
                applications can be found in the pharmaceutical, chemical and
                food industries, as well as in battery technology, metallurgy,
                3d printing and, of course, silo design.

our major products
... are ring shear testers (automatic, computer-controlled
              testers for powder flow analysis, i.e. measurement of flow
              properties like the flow function, strength, internal friction,
              wall friction, time consolidation "caking", flowability
              coefficient) and software for hopper design for flow (following
              the great work of andrew w. jenike).

news and info


 
new large ring shear tester 
we are proud to present the ring shear tester rst mk ii
                  (image above) which is the successor to model rst-01.pc.
                  it  is upwardly compatible with its predecessor (e.g.,
                  usability of the same shear cells). it offers improved design,
                  and is smaller and lighter.
with the tester, the new software rst-control v3 is
                  delivered.

small ring shear tester rst-xs.s
the "small" automatic, digitally controlled ring shear tester
                  rst-xs.s for the measurement of flow properties of powders
                  (flowability, caking, wall friction). automatic,
                  computer-controlled powder testing procedure. very small
                  specimen volume (standard: only about 30 ml, smallest approx.
                  3.5 ml).

cahd - software for silo design for flow
cahd: computer-aided hopper design.
                  an interactive software doing the common calculations
                  according to a. w. jenike's theory and, if desired, also
                  according to other approaches: hopper slope for mass flow
                  (diameter-dependent), outlet dimensions to avoid arching and
                  ratholing. the entire process is user-controlled and
                  transparent: diagrams and extrapolations are finally presented
                  in a comprehensive document.

small volume shear cell xs-sr
the shear cell type xs-sr for ring shear testers rst-xs.s and
                  rst-xs with only 10 ml specimen volume is provided with a lid
                  and bottom ring design similar to the larger shear cells xs-mr
                  and xs-lr.

shear cell and driving axle with reduced heat transfer
this new accessory for the ring shear tester rst-xs.s design
                  supports tests at temperatures deviating from room temperature
                  (reduced heat transfer, increased heat capacity).

optimized design of shear cells for large ring shear testers
                  rst-01.pc and rst mk ii
a new generation of shear cells for the large ring shear
                  tester rst-01.pc and its successor rst mk ii offers advantages
                  in terms of cleaning and handling. available with a sample
                  volume of 900 ml, 200 ml and 48 ml.
