i had a good day.i woke up at seven because the basketball team im coaching had their first game. the director of the league is an asshole to me.. hes one of those men that only care about winning and looks like he was in the army and owns a confederate flag and that sort of thing, but anyways ive talked to him on the phone a couple of times and hes a complete ass just because im young and he thinks he can do that to be. so anyways i tried to ignore him when we got there but he came up and said for me to fill out some papers.. wich i did. and he was giving me sass but i didnt let it get to me cuz hes an old man that has no life and has nothing better to do but scare me. haha anywho my team started playing and they kicked so much ass! we won and after the director comes up to me and pats me on the back and said "good job way to coach!!" so i guess im a good coach because we won? whatever the girls had fun and they were so cute,... you guys have to come to one game we are orange and called "the smashing pumpkins"... i love my life, truly.then i came home and talked to kyle about how i would like to someday become a producer in the music business... lots of people have told me i would be good at that and heh i just happen to bring it up while talking to him and he said he thought about it too.... then we decided "hey! why not start a company to help manage and promote bands?" its just and idea but it is entirely possible... hell im up for it.i want to go to the beach tonite.to bad im grounded... words of advice kids "never tell your mom to fuck off.... it gets you nowhere but grounded " duh?im dumb... thats awesomeim kinda happy school is coming again i miss peopleand art class.i love all of you so much!jordan come home!<3 erin

i have an idea.... i think all of us should meet up in a parking lot late at night when its raining and slow dance to nothing but frank sinatra. and all of us would get wet intentionally, no rain coats or umbrellas just you, frank, and the rain... that would be delightful.last night i couldn't fall asleep, this is really wierd because i havent been able to fall asleep until after two in the morning for the last five nights in a row. anyways... numerous things were running through my head, but the thing i thought about most was love in general. ( this may get cheesy watch out) i thought about how so many people make such a huge deal out of it, and to be brutally honest with you the only love i have ever expierence has well... sucked. after all those butterflies and hopes just came either pain or anger, and thats the farthest ive gotten as of now. have i ever been truly in love before? no. but i cant help but wonder how it feels. does anybody know what i am talking about? you see people all the time hugging and kissing and what not and i always look at these people and think... does she really love him, or is she just seeing what happens.. as she leads him on to think she really does. and visa versa. for quite some time ive been holding onto the notion that if love was meant to be, it would come along and fate would sort things out for me. well either its just not meant to be or fate is lazy. even after all this thinking i still feel like i could be missing out on something i dont want to be missing out on. and the only other thing i could think about last night was how much i wanted somebody laying next to me feeling the same way.pardon my frech, but... fuck being alone<3 erin

today is january 1, 2004
as i'm sure you've already been told, happy new year!
why do people need a holiday like new years to regain their sense of self and set goals? isn't that why god gives us everyday?.... isn't everyday a fresh start? or am i just wierd?
anyways however you decide to handle your day i wish you well.
 
i'm wearing one of those "pore cleansing masks" that turn hard on your face and you look like an alien when you wear it...... im scared my facial parts are going to fall off because it feels as if my face has turned into death vally haha :o0
you know im starting to notice something, about 75 percent of livejournals i have read are about how sad peoples lives are or how much they hate their parents or how ugly they are. and yada yada yada im sure i too have done my fair share in the whining department, actually im posative about that but  i say we all just get over all the pointless crap we worry about and move on with our lives in a happy manor. whos with me?!?!
i went to the fabric store today and bought all the things i need to make a new backpack because mine is broken and i dont want to but a new ugly one.... i hope i dont screw it up! 
 
i highly reccomend looking up new bands of different categories or music genres... you hear the same things over and over again but new things make you think outside the box..... just a suggestion for those suffering of bordom.
 
speaking of bordom due to winter break im so bored i dont know what to do with myself... in fact today i was looking up baby names, not that im expecting babies at all anytime soon i just liked to look at the names.. hmmm, i should take up gardening or pottery or something senior citizens do.
 
well im off

the time is 7:24 pm and new years is coming, im sitting in my room all alone kind of feeling unsocial but content in my space. anyways... i would like to take this time to say a few things i have discovered this year.* the thing ive been fearing the most is change, in friends, family, school, job, life... whatever. but ive realized  that no matter how much i miss previous years im still in the present and my best friends are still my best friends, just older and wanting more much like myself. money is nice to have but i will always make it out surviving having money or not, my family if sometimes disfunctional but whos family isnt?, school shouldnt be considered a chore but more of what i would call a privelage... you cant blame people for changing either, change is the basic rule of life, without it we would all be considered still life humans. * yes, the world is going insane but it all depends on how you look at itthings i am thankful for at this moment.- family and friends- heaters- pajamas and sweaters- new years and fresh starts to the next 365 days- church- courtney, kyle, david, katie..... the ones who after all of my ungodly hours are still around - my guitar (duh)- my sketch book - my dog - homestar runner dot com- music- good books- coffee places- the johnson family- w squared, only 2 of u know what that is and im thankful for that- lemonade- how just one hug from him can make my troubles turn to dusti feel like ive come back from the dead. i took the last 2 hours and decided that there is no point in bringing yesterdays problems to today and last years problems into tomorrow. im not going to make a new years "resolution" because my resolutions have never turned out to plan but plans are boring just like resolutions, im just going to live.people are unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered. love them anywayif you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.do good anyway.if you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.succeed anyway.the good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.do good anyway.honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.be honest and frank anyway.what you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.build anyway.people really need help, but may attack you if you help them.help them anyway.give the world the best you have, and you will get kicked in the teeth.give the world the best you have anyway.-mother theresahanging out with some friends makes you realize how much you actually have, so does cleaning your roomthink of it this way if you wake up one day in a bad mood and you dont want to get out of bed, dont want to get your blood flowing or anything you will pretty much think that way all day. if you get up one morning and say to yourself "today is going to be a good day" and open your blinds and let the sun in your day will most likely be good, same goes for a new year.happy new years everyonei love all (and i mean all) of you eringoughbrah<3 erin

so a good weekend all in all. lets recap...friday-saw other than else and genius!! put a cat in ryans car heh heh hehsaturday-spent some good time with my mom wich is good because we are getting along now due to her new job. saw the cat in the hat wich was pretty damn funny. bought 12 books, read one.sunday-went to work from 7-12 davids mom picked me up and took me to davids, went to the mall with david and andy, made satanic noises, got in lots of trouble, got beat up by david... that bitch., went home, called kyle, got ready to go to the movies, saw "gothica" got really fuckin scared and cold, went home to a dark house when everyone was asleep, sat in bed thinking of what i had just watched, didnt go to sleep until 5 in the mornin but it was a good flick.yes a good weekend indeedso today i woke up very tired and very late so i looked like crap but i often look like crap so it was all good. then i was hyper in art cuz courtney dawson was there and i love her like a baby loves its mother. (riiiiiiiiiight) then in biology i fell asleep for like 30 minutes i was just out. the wierd part was i had a dream about courtney sandlin throwing soda at me hahah then i woke up and i didnt know where i was or what time it was and i was very confused. i hate it when people bail out on me all the time. (this is the part where i start bitching about people bailing out on me)i dont know why but this seems to be happening  a lot, i must be boring to hang out with. i guess i will just stop calling this certian someone, if you wanna hang out , you know the number buddy, im so sick of this shit. (this is the part where im done bitching about people bailing out on me) im increadibly sad to announce that mary jane has left. mary will now be living in bakersfield. when i heard that i started to cry, partly because i feel like ive lost a part of me and partly because i didnt even get to say goodbye. mary if you read this i love you and i miss you already. you are only a bus ride away and if you ever need me to be there for you ,you know where to call. im gunna miss her so much, shes like mary tyler moore "she can turn the world on with her smile, love is all around no need to waste it la la la la la ur gunna make it after all," or somethin like that. you never realize how much you love someone so much until they are gone... and we never got to have a band practice for "the centerfold" i love you so much mary, be strong girlie, i love you so much. i have just saddened myself... ratsokay im out peace, love, and hansonmmmmm bop!

im coldim tiredim boredim so bored i dont know what to do with myself so i am going to update this for the 2nd time today.my hands are still cold from last time i updated.nobodys home and im hearing funny noises so im freaked out.i tried to call courtney... no answertried to call kyle... no answerwould try callin katie but she out with the hot asian.blastedi lead a sad life... who do you know that buys a book and in the same day finishes reading it? im a loser. coool!i saw the cat in the hat today... good flick but im more excited about the preview i saw for the movie "peter pan" oh god i got chills i was so excited... and i was cold lolyou know what really blows?my heater is broken.i will stop complaining about temperatures and move on.you know what i bought? the blink 182 cd.yea laugh it up.but you know i had a converge cd in my hand and a blink 182 in the other. and i figure converge is a great band (or at least i like em) but converge will only satisfy my "im angry or pissed or sad" mood but blink 182 is like "im a happy 6th grader again" so i bought blink 182 and  must say it wasnt like the old stuff but it was blink 182 and it made me happy. so i pulled out all my other old cds heres a list of what i had from back thenwheatusblink 182korn.. oh yeansynclimp bizkethansonthe spice girlsthe beatleseminemnirvanagood charlotte... i know i know shut up i was young and stupidthe atarishaha man i love old cd's... takes me back to fond times of miss mc ray calling me stephine... she never did call me erin.and she would give me saturdays and fill them out as stephine enright and i would never do then and got away with it every time, makes me think of kelly cordeiro, basketball (when i was kick ass), ian haga, kc carrol, david tejera, chance myers, sam rips, and tyler van evra, when they were all best friends, courtney dawson and chapstick, when i needed riddilin, mrs hyonk and her hippie guitar, make it a great day or not... the choice is yours, wutkee, mykie and the moon, katie and courtney when they saved me from kelly and made my life grand again, cole olman, jeff miller, and the to westlake rivalry... then when we got to high school nobody cared who won lol. good timeslets dance.

so anyways, i havent updated this shit in a while, seeing as though my computer has a mind of its own and only works when it wants too... piece of shit. many things have happened, lets see....oh i know!... did you guys know that afi also stands for american film institute?... yea i think people should understand this fact and it should be brought to the worlds attention.oh kyle....so funny, had fun though probably some of the most fun ive had in a hell of a long time. i wont go into it though too long to type too much for you to read but trust me... good times.dude my hands are freezing....so i've written 65 pages of this so called book, and i cant decide weather to be happy or to burn them!speaking of books. i went book shopping today! one of my favorite things to do is go book shopping, but anyways. i was a barnes and noble while my mom looked at furnature in cost plus so i had about an hour to kill. i just kinda walked around and looked over books and read the back covers. next time your in that store id like you to look around and notice how freakin huge it is!!! it was kind of intimidating. lol i looked at this 2pac book and i read about all this gang related stuff it was pretty interesting, i wanted to buy it but it was like 50 bucks so yea, then i looked at the "spiritual section" and it was all about these wierd religions and shit some pretty crazy stuff, interesting though. this is all very irrelevent so i think i will just cut to the chase. i found myself in the " self improvement section" and there were tons of books that people actually buy on how to reinvent yourself, i looked it over for a while and thought "people actually buy this shit?" but the more i read the more i grew to like it and i stood there reading for a good amount of time. turns out i ended up buying a book called " you" and it said "how to reclaim your power, creativity,and dreams" im almost half way through it because i cant put it down... who knew? then i bought another book called "riding with the queen" about a girl who leaves home to become a rock star. why not? other than else was grandwhen i watch kai play guitar im in complete aw its like i cant even speak, what can you say ..." heh.. heh ... hes good" lol another highlight of the night was when we saw the random guy dancing like a mad man all by himself, some of the greatest dancing ive ever seen! but the one thing that topped it all off.........genius. yes you heard it. there was this band called genius that sounded like creed but worse (as if creed isnt bad enough) the lead singer was a total nut he kept going "we are all friends" and saying "come on come on come on!" he had a spiked mullet too. the thing that made it so funny was this guy that sat a few seats behind me kept going "yea genius!!!!!!!"  "i love you genius!!!!!!" totally making fun of this poor band and then out of nowhere he screams "even jesus hates creed!!!!!" hahahaha so sad but sooooooooo funny. it was me, courtney sandlin, ryan, and emily and ryan and i pretend we hate eachother, i always say he looks like a giant baby (cuz he does) and he just says dumb gay ass comments to me as a joke so anyways... i was sitting by myself waiting for courtney and ryan and emily were at the other end of the theater. no bands were playing and people were just talking. ryan decides to stand up and scream "erin, your sitting all by yourself!!" hahaha everyone looked at me and saw that yes i was sitting by myself. so then after all the bands played we left and ryan dropped everyone off. when i was getting out of the car i saw my neighabors cat so i picked him up put him in and shut the door. ryan was like "jump out kitty!" haha.... guess you had to be there.okay well im gunna stop boring youi love you all and miss you much!quote of the day! "he only true currency in this bankrupt world...is what you share with someone else when you're uncool."- almost famous

im in that mood again....im starting to find im in this mood quite often, this is all so formilliar! my mind is off wondering somewhere else thinking about some random shit that will never be relevent to anything at all, except for my own demented pleasure of things i find interesting that nobody else really even cares to hear about. for instance today while in detention i totally zoned out for about a half hour. i was reading the book kyle let be borrow , so then i sat there while my mind left the room. i kept thinking about people in general. i decided that i am not human. haha i decided that i am an alien dressed as a human but i just dont know it, but today i figured it out. honestly i dont get people, people evolved from monkeys then made some fire and a few billion years later we sit here on computers writing journals listening to ipods. makes me wonder... what the fuck is the point of it all? then i thought about how people that are "wierd" ,not accepted, considered the scum of the earth. what do they think about people? what do they see when they look at me? human alien whatever i am i hope im doin a good job and not wasting it. i also thought about my biggest fears and i think that my only fear is this whole wasting time thing. im not so scared of the dying part just the part that comes after. i mean what would they say at my funeral? "here lies erin enright, she wrote stupid livejournals and watched a lot of movies... she didnt get very good grades because she hated going to school, she thought about random pointless shit and now shes dead, she didnt make a difference in anyones life and wasted away." maybe not that blunt but they wouldnt say much. haha. i put it into terms like this, everyday you get up. from the second you open your eyes to the time you shut them, you you dont know what the fuck is gunna go down. but the second you open your eyes it is up to you to make those next hours count, because life goes on within you and without youdetention is really a bitch, i need to stop getting into trouble. the one i served today was for doing something i dont regret. my english teacher is a complete dick , hes just an asshole. so we have ssr and we were reading and he said i wasnt aloud to read the catcher in the rye by jd salinger. the books a fuckin classic but according to captian dipshit its "too high for my reading level" so i of course being the person i am said "i think i can handle it" and yada yada yada i basically said im gunna read this weather you like it or not and he said "if you dont like my ethics of teaching you can leave" so of course i packed my shit and walked out. next day i come back with the same book and the asshole gives me a dentention for cutting class on the previous day..... wtf???!?!?! damn norma jean is good. and my new favorite "as i lay dying"man so good sooooo goodokay im gunna go think of something to do on the lovely nite.quote of the day.... ahem"you know youve found it, because you feel it when its taken away" -damien riceroll out... roll out... roll out ...hehe thats a cool songok im really goin byei love everyone!

so i just got home from david's house. man i love that kid. anyways i watched their band practice and for some reason, today it sounded the best ive ever heard them, and ive heard them many times. im so happy for him because he's always wanted this and they are sounding pretty damn good, if you like hardcore i guess wich i am starting to like more and more by the way. i dont care if you people laugh at me, whateva... i do what i want! lol. so this morning i went to the coaches clinic and learned how to coach 8 year old girls to play basketball, im kinda of increadibly excited. my sister is assistant coach and we just got note of our practice schedual.... eeeeehehehe! lol the down side to going to the clinic was the embarassment. last nite while driving home from eltorito  with my family my brother and his freind sat behind me in the back and stuck about 12 peppermints to my sweatshirt wich i wore this morning and made a complete idiot out of myself but it was pretty funny haha.. asshole. haha.so now i'm about to make my family some dinner. im making irish sclloped potatoes and chicken with bread, damn im good!!! lol.  you guys havent lived unti; youve had irish potatoes, i think i will throw a party in honor of them .. yes its on lol.dude!!! i got an ipod!!! my mom knows this lady who just bought a vw bug and i guess if you buy the car you get a free ipod and the lady doesnt even own a computer so she said she was selling it for 100 bucks. so i freakin jumped on that and bought it off her. it had never even been opened! man im such a lucky bastard! those are usually like 350 bucks! i guess thats god telling me to throw away my ghetto head phones, i cant bring myself to it though, too many memories hahaha.so im thinking about doin asb next year, thet would be fun and id be good with that, hahaha me in asb thats greatyou know whats wierd that i noticed today? i was in the car and i looked at david and i had like this wierd time travel shit thing happen. it was so wierd! like i actually saw my life flash before my eyes. haha im so wierd but i dunno i just looked at him and saw him they way he is now and i was so amazed. i mean after all ive been through with him, all his little stages and here we are. i dunno its wierd how everyone changes, like the people i knew my whole lives exp: kelly cordeiro, robert fielding, david tejera, katie, courtney, kela vitalie, sarah kenna, elise la flemme. we all used to be so close but now roberts a pot head elise is at continue and i never ever see her! kelly cordeiro is miss softball star and kela is in asb with bari sowa. katie and courtney, still pretty much the same lol. but i dunno its just wierd how time changes us all, some for better some for worse some not really at all. but the thing that really sucks is in 10 years from now i dont know if i will even see these people, or they will remember me. i remember i spent my whole time being a kid waiting to be a "big kid" and now that i am a "big kid" i just want to go back. jd knotts from respira once said "things dont change, they just hide in better places"....what a wise young chap. hmmmmm. i miss all of you... aww love! hahahaokay i will go away now lollet us fly!!!!!!.........xoxox-erin
