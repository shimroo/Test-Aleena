 camping is better​on the river








call for reservations


 

 



















just a 1/2 mile off the parkway in pigeon forge, tn, we are conveniently located near great restaurants, shows, shopping malls, and all the exciting activities the smoky mountains have to offer!
traveling in your rv? no problem!we are within walking distance of a trolley stop that runs from sevierville all the way to gatlinburg, including the famous dollywood.





o u r   s t o r y






















we originally opened to help meet the expected lodging needs for the 1982 world's fair in nearby knoxville, tn. from there the vision grew to provide a safe and relaxing place for families to camp while they explore the great smoky mountains national park. throughout our 40+ years in business, our campers have become friends and our friends became family.we hope you will visit us and become a part of our riverbend family!
