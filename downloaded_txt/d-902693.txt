“words cannot describe how amazing terry binns spa is! terry binns outcompetes all other salons in the kc metro area because of a myriad of reasons. first off, they hire the best of the best. for example, sean and blanca are amazing hairstylists. when i sit in either of their hair chair, i feel grateful knowing that i am in the best hands. moreover, the entire atmosphere of terry binns makes me feel like i'm walking into a new world of luxury. the overall professionalism, ambiance, and terrific services are truly fantastic. i love terry binns and wouldn't want to get a facial, my nails, or hair done anywhere else!”— lauren v, terry binns spa client
