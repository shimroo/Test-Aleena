nice, well-kept park. most sites are long term. offers fishing lake, pool, kids playground, laundry, and church on sundays. we were here for several months and paid a monthly rate. would definitely stay here again.

rollngstonz, rv park review


this campground/resort is an unexpected surprise. it has a feeling of summertime in the 1950’s and 60’s. most sites are shaded by lovely trees and very roomy. actually the entire place is in one big grove of trees. there is a smaller lake to fish. the grounds are large but feel comfy. we will definitely be back. have met some nice folks.

billy2015, rv park review


fun place to stay at, lots to do, fishing, swimming (both beach and pool), boating, and camping. staff is really friendly and family oriented and and they do their best to make sure you have a pleasant stay.

brad o, tripadvisor review


we visited fish lake beach this summer several times to go fishing and swim. it has breathtaking views of the lake and we were able to get our licenses and bait right there. the place is clean and spread out so it was nice and quiet. will be back to camp.

suzanne t, yelp review


i have been going to flb for nearly 40 years. always a good experience. i had fun as a child, my kids always enjoyed flb and now my grandchildren enjoy it. the staff is great, the beach is great, the fishing is great and the pic nice areas are nicely located to the park and water areas.
