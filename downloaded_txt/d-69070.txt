i wrote a book!













i am very excited to announce that my book, italian folk magic: rue's kitchen witchery, is available at all fine booksellers!personalized signed copies are always available here!"the kitchen, my kitchen, is the room where nourishing meals are prepared. it is where afternoon coffee is brewed and stories shared. when someone doesn't feel well, it is where chicken soup simmers and herbal teas for any ailment are brewed. stored in the cupboards are dishes and cups, some of which once graced my mother's kitchen. it is where my herbs, spices, and oils are stored. it is the room where old friends sit and enjoy a cookie with freshly brewed espresso and share their joys and sorrows. it's where i go to pray. i meditate while i clean and pray while i cook. it is the room where most of my memories live. it is my temple, shrine, and altar."  fahrun, mary-grace. italian folk magic: rue's kitchen witchery italian folk magic is a fascinating journey through the magical, folkloric, and healing traditions of italy with an emphasis on the practical. the reader learns uniquely italian methods of magical protection and divination and spells for love, sex, control, and revenge.the book contains magical and religious rituals and prayers and explores divination techniques, crafting, blessing rituals, witchcraft, and, of course, the evil eye, known as malocchio in italian―the author explains what it is, where it comes from, and, crucially, how to get rid of it.this book can help italians regain their magical heritage, but italian folk magic is a beautiful, powerful, and effective magical tradition that is accessible to anyone who wants to learn it.
