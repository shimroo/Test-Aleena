loved by service technicians across the country



reasoning for selecting the aim equipment compared to competitorsaim offers us a system that is serviceable without completely shutting down the system because of their design having four sets of condensers and compressors we can do repairs and still provide chill water to the area.also with their design, we have the ability to run only what is needed. for example, in the winter months we may not need to run a 500-ton capacity we have a variable with the unit that unloads the system load and saves power consumption. with a centrifugal system, the entire system has to go down. if this happens unplanned, we could potentially cause shutting down of drives in mcc rooms because of heat.finally, with aim we have excellent support for parts, supplies, and technical assistance. we currently on mill site have a smaller scale system in one of our drive rooms that uses the screw type compressors and have had great success with it. unfortunately, with our carrier tech and parts support it is limited along with the trane equipment.in conclusioni believe that aim. is the better choice for the system because they have proven to be about reliability, quality, and support in the equipment that they have provided to us at the mill.the staff at air are willing and eager to assist, train, and develop a maintainable piece of equipment that meets our specs and keep in mind the serviceability of the equipment in mind. ultimately, when it comes to having a maintenance staff on site i would chose the equipment that offers the reliability and support to the maintenance workers that are there to handle it.— r.g.
