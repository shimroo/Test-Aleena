baby middle names advice
#1) say your baby middle name ideas with the first and last name together. the ideal middle name should flow and not wrap your tongue up in knots.
#2) a middle name that begins with a different letter or sound than the first name ends with normally makes for a smoother name combination. 
#3) vary the number of syllables in each name. a long middle name can nicely compliment a short first and last name. a short middle name can smooth out a long first and last name combination. whatever you do, don't string three long names together (unless you want your child to have difficulty filling out forms their whole life!)

i'm testing your ability! i want to incorporate both of my grandmas' names in my girl name. dorothy vivian and nancy helen. last name could be cooper or vinson so i need a name that goes with both. no common names but not too crazy of names either! let's see what you've got! thanks in advance! :)
baby name genie:
fortunately i've been studying in my lamp all night.  a change on dorothy's middle name and a restoration of nancy's first gives you the gracious and lively vivica anne.  do i pass the test?

hi! i have two girls and one boy: spencer, sloane and sawyer. we are expecting our fourth - a boy! we want his first name to start with "s" like his siblings. his middle names will be memphis faulkner. can you help?
baby name genie:
ah, smart mom.  this way, when you yell at them, you can start the "s" and hold it while you try to remember the rest of their name.   very clever!  when the youngest gets in trouble, just remember his name is stewart.

here is a challenge for you: my husband and i are both latin. my first son's name is elias alexander leyva. i want to name my second son ariel jesus, but my husband disagrees. he thinks ariel is a girl's name. i want a name with the initials a.e. can you come up with a nice biblical name?
baby name genie:
you can thank walt disney and his mermaid for ruining the boy's name ariel for you.  instead, try aaron ezra for a name perfectly suited for a young man.
