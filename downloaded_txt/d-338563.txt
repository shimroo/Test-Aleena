  who we are

 the ymca of columbia-willamette hosted its first meeting in the basement of the first presbyterian church in downtown portland in 1868. ever since, our cause has been to empower individual growth and foster community-building in people from all walks of life through family, fitness, faith, and fun.
we are a catalyst for transformational change, fostering relationships and building thriving, inclusive communities.

        our community
      
 


        our principles are defined as love, respect, honesty, responsibility, and service. these principles set us apart in all that we do. more than a health provider or a place for children to play, the y’s mission is to engage the entire person—spirit, mind, and body.
