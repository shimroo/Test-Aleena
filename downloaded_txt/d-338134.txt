winter is coming! the mushrooms tell me so!





i live on and travel among the islands in the salish sea, an intricate network of coastal waterways that stretches from british columbia to the pacific northwest. here among the temperate rainforests i create artwork that combines illustration, photography and the temporary arrangement of local plants, mushrooms and other found items.
