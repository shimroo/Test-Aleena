growing up, i never really felt like i belonged, and as a first-generation college student, i had no guidance when it came to applying to schools. i wanted to find a place that wouldnât be a financial strain on my mom, so i almost dismissed abac, thinking it was just an agriculture school. but after a stallion day tour, i knew this was the place for me. i joined the camp program, where they helped me with everythingâfrom picking classes to building professional skills. abac may be small, but itâs huge in resources. itâs opened doors i never imagined, like speaking at the capitol, becoming an ambassador, and serving as an sga senator for my school! i came for the affordability, but iâm staying for the communityâabac truly feels like home.






daniel durrence
agricultural technology management




attending abac has been one of the greatest seasons of my life! the college has some of the greatest resources for learning. hands on labs with relevant and current technologies have made learning fun and exciting, but it is not the courses that make abac unique. it's the people! from my very first semester, iâve been surrounded by the most genuine peers, professors, advisors, and staff who have made a lasting impact on my journey.â these people have given me memories and experiences that will last forever! i wouldn't trade my time at abac for anything!






christopher marsh

i came to abac expecting to just get my degree and move on to vet school. what i didnât expect, was to fall in love with the community here. the community at abac is like no other, it has truly become my home away from home! one thing that makes abac feel like home to me is the different clubs, abac has a club for everyone. clubs help foster that community that abac is known for, i have personally joined several clubs, the abac pre-vet club, student government association, and the student-alumni council. all these clubs have helped me find like-minded people that share similar interests as me.
