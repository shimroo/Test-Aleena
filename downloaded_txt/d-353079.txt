why tysa?



  





playing soccer at tysa is a great way for your child to stay fit and develop athleticism and coordination while building lasting friendships. we offer both spring and fall programs for children ages 3-18, as well as for adults. several camps are also offered throughout the year.
our philosophy centers on providing players a strong foundation of skills and tactics while cultivating a love for the game. players will develop technically, but more importantly, they will mature emotionally.
triumph works to keep players challenged, progressing, and passionate about soccer. we encourage players to take their passion home and become a fan of professional soccer to learn what the game can be and train and play in your back yard.
