testimonials






"our collaboration with shamrock cabinets has enriched our projects immensely. their expertise shines through in every cabinet they create, adding an unparalleled level of sophistication to our homes. from luxury kitchens that blend seamlessly into the living spaces to elegant bathroom vanities, shamrock's craftsmanship is a testament to their dedication to perfection.
working with the shamrock team has been an absolute pleasure. their designers and craftsmen not only bring our ideas to life flawlessly but also offer insightful suggestions that elevate the final outcome. their seamless communication and adherence to project timelines have greatly contributed to the smooth flow of our construction process.
the feedback from homeowners has been overwhelmingly positive. homeowners consistently express admiration for the exquisite cabinetry that graces their living spaces. the level of detail, the precision of the joinery, and the overall aesthetics have left a lasting impression, turning houses into true dream homes."
austin roeserpresident, roeser homes








"shamrock delivers cabinets to the site on-time and ensures we keep our schedules on track.  since all of our cabinets are stained or painted on-site, this is crucial to make sure we have timely delivery of the home to our buyers.
glenn is amazing to work with.  there is never a delay in getting back to us when we have questions on projects.  when we have a custom request, he is quick to provide concept drawings or provide insight in ways we could maximize storage or space to create an efficient lay-out.  one example of glenn and shamrock’s customer service on a recent project was when we added a wetbar after the other cabinets had already been installed.  he had the wet bar built and installed within 2 weeks after the request.  this ensured we had minimal impact to our construction schedule.
overall glenn and shamrock provide high-quality cabinets, on time and with an excellent customer service approach."
