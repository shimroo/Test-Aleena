not only did i get a great deal, but it also qualified for loyalty points. i have used hotel engine multiple times and have even used it for my market reservation. recent bookings have not been at 70% off, but still have been good discounts. i used to think the office depot benefits would pay for my membership, now i think it is hotel engine." – mike c.the rates were close to $600 using any of my other discount possibilities but, through ihfra, i was able to rent a car with enterprise for <$300! i just more than paid for my annual dues. incredible! thank you, ihfra!" – stan t. © 2025 the international home furnishing representatives association – ihfra  |  site by growthzone get in touch!
