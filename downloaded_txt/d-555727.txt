suncoast basset rescue’s goal is to rescue, rehabilitate, and find a forever home for any basset hound in florida who needs us - stray, abandoned, sheltered, owner surrender – just for the love of the breed. in doing this, we bring health and happiness to both the hound and to the humans who give a basset a home.  our organization gives bassets a second chance to live as they were intended – as someone’s best friend.

adopt                         when you adopt adog, you save a life. sbr puts in a lot of time and effort into each of our bassets because the goal of our rescue is to place every one of our hounds in their final and forever home.  there’s a perfect match for everyone and every family. and, fortunately, we have found wonderful basset homes all over florida.available  hounds
















foster        do you have it your heart to love and help a basset? then you may be a good foster home. we have a need, right now,  for more foster  homes. fostering a basset hound will be one of the most rewarding experiences you can have.  a foster takes in a stray, unwanted, or neglected basset, provides it a safe and loving home and gives the hound the time needed to be ready for adoption.


































by providing a forever foster home, sbr also comes to aid of bassets diagnosed with a serious illness or a behavioral issue like sever anxiety.  our forever foster bassets will remain with sbr to live out their final days with medical care, comfort and love from their foster family.  please consider becoming a monthly donor as a forever foster guardian by virtually adopting your forever foster.  your commitment will help support the care of this wonderful basset.learn more
