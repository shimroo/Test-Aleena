frustrated 
        by conflict & hurdles to effective cooperation in your organisation?




o 
              do your customers rave about your services?
              o does your organisation do well in global markets?
              o are your people contributing to your business targets?






often 
              due to major restructurings, downsizing, re-engineering, mergers, 
              joint ventures or other forms of alliances, many organisations find 
              that their people 






are 
              not working well together.   companies lose clients, lose 
              key talent or fail to remain competitive and sustain a competitive 
              advantage, because of poor cross-






 
              functional communications, internal conflicts, misunderstandings 
              and stress, or because of poor working relations across various 
              boundaries, especially in our 'globalised' world.





we 
        work with organisations seeking to improve profitability by leveraging 
        the potential in their human capital - we help them build bridges across 
        cultures, whether departmental, corporate or international.  we work 
        with managers to create effective cooperation and synergy within their 
        organisations.
