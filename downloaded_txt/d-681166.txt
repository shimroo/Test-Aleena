  it was our first experience with the 42 and it was great. she is a safe and comfortable cruiser. the kids especially had a great time and their three friends who came along will never forget the trip. this photo was taken in salt pond bay st. john usvi.

  skip and andrea, we have returned home safe and sound, but more importantly, very relaxed and ready to tackle the working world once more. as usual island yachts has come through with another great charter for our vacation. a good clean boat, thoroughly prepared, has become the expected norm from you and your company. you always manage to impress us with your consistent top shelf operation… the ip-420 is an awesome boat… when the winds come up a bit, the boat really responds well, and at the same time we have a comfortable and dry ride. the island packet 420 is a true ‘performance cruiser

  andrea, we had a wonderful time on our recent charter trip with you. the vi’s are all they’re supposed to be. kids loved every minute and were great sailors. boat was perfect. i was quite pleased to do checkout with skip. service was great. everyone on iyc staff was courteous and professional… just barely on the plane out of san juan to the states and my wife is planning our next trip
