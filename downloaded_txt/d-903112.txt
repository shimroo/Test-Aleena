addressing unwanted scam emails


        the term spam refers to any unsolicited, irrelevant, or inappropriate email sent to users, often for advertising purposes, and without the recipient's consent. this definition encompasses unwanted "e-newsletters" or other mailings wherein an individual can be subscribed without their explicit knowledge or approval.

understanding the 419 nigerian scam




    the nigerian 419 scam, named after its association with the 4-1-9 penal code, is a classic 'advance fee' fraud scheme. according to fbi data, global losses linked to these scams surpass us $200 million annually. in south africa alone, the estimated losses reach up to r100 million each year. typically, the scam involves various deceptive business offers, including: procuring goods, real estate transactions, fund transfers from over-invoiced deals, discounted crude oil sales, unclaimed inheritance funds, and investment scams.

methods of scam baiting




        a primary objective of scam baiting strategies is to divert a 419 scammer's attention and resources. by engaging scammers in redundant dialogues, it ensures they are not targeting a potential victim. such direct engagements are commonly referred to as "straight baits." many scam baiters also employ tactics to send these fraudsters on wild goose chases, from repeated visits to western union offices anticipating non-existent funds to booking accommodations for fictional visitors. some even manage to lure scammers to venues like hotels, docks, or airports, under the pretense of meeting their would-be victims.
