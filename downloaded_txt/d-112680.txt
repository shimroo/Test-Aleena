love the image chris. good composition and wonderful colours.given the clarity and detail you have captured, i find the blur of the person in the shot quite distracting tho.otherwise a wondeful image- well done.  more...

photo project of the month 
project #78

railroads

this should be a fun project. there are railroads everywhere! from full size to table top and all sizes in between. steam engines, diesels, electric hand or pedal powered. tracks, signals, stations you name it railroad stuff is abundant and should make for some very interesting photos as railroads are all different depending on your location. so lets see some artistic photos related to railroads and railroading, including the crusty old engineers! have fun!
