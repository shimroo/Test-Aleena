ecotecture | journal of ecological design


















 
why have we devoted a special section of ecotecture, the journal of ecological design, to houses? because by creating a more environmentally friendly house, you can work directly on the planet’s problems — and benefit directly from your work. keep addressing the broad issues discussed in ecotecture, but learn what you can do at your ecological house . . .

eco-nomics: modeling a sustainable economy on ecosystems
the growth and health of “the economy” is usually seen as unrelated to, or in conflict with the health of the planetary ecosystem, or ecosphere. this is an artificial distinction, because the human economic system is entirely dependent upon the ecosphere to sustain it...
