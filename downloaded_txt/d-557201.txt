	 lighted slippers
	 



move around your home at night without tripping or turning on the lights. when you begin walking with these very comfortable slippers, the pressure of your toes turns the light on, if it is dark. they have a bright led light in the toe that guides you to the refrigerator or the bathroom without stumbles or stubbed toes. the light sensor responds to dark conditions and is weight activated, so it will only illuminate when you need it, extending the battery life. these slippers are soft, cushioned terrycloth with non-skid soles. you can hand wash them. powered by 2 lithium batteries (included) that are easy to replace. beige color. available in the following sizes. select your size when ordering.small that fit men's sizes 5 - 6 and ladies' 6 - 7medium that fit men's sizes 7 -9 and ladies' 8 - 10large that fit men's 11 - 12 and ladies' 11 - 13. eal present for comfort, safety and fun!lighted slippers

	 iz
	 
    


i think the iz is just plain fun.  capable of playing music from your ipod or your stereo system, this is a great toy for kids.  twist his ears or push his belly to modulate the sounds.  kids will love his sound effects and his eye movements.  i've seen them in red, green and blue.btw, this is a toy for kids, so don't buy it as a cheap speaker for your ipod.  you won't enjoy the results.
