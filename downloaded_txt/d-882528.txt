bobby and his team helped us auction an unconventional collection of items and went above and beyond our expectations!  to call the situation challenging would be an understatement but they were professional, helpful, knowledgeable, and got a great result.  thanks again!





– cynthia j. cutler tcw/tennessee express



colson auctions handled the liquidation of my fathers estate. at the time, we were reluctant to sell; but colson auctions got us top dollar even though the country was in recession. the process was smooth, easy, and everything was handled. my father now has the money to maintain himself in retirement.





– david clariday



i highly recommend colson auction & realty. i have sold over 3500 vehicles since 2004 at colson auto auction and couldn’t be more pleased. they provide an excellent venue to liquidate collateral and do so in an efficient and professional manner. i have also used their services to settle a close friend’s estate, selling both real estate and personal property, and in that tough time, they were very caring and considerate!





– austin davis, regional manager, neighborhood title loans i, llc. 



i have had the pleasure of doing business with the colson auction co. on more than one occasion. i have gone to many auctions, for both personal and real property. i have been welcomed to each event and have always felt as if the staff is approachable and knowledgeable. i had such great experiences that when it came time for me to buy and sell property the colson auction co. were the only auction company i felt both comfortable and assured with. they were professional and prompt; getting me the most money in the shortest amount of time. i have used their services on more than one occasion as well as referred them to friends and family. i have gone to other auctions but have never felt the employees of any other company had a personal investment, that in my mind being the biggest difference. i want the people i do business with to feel the same as myself, invested!
