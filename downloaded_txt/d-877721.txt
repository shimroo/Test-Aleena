about sigma chi

















"sigma chi was a learning experience for me in personal growth, in finding out more about myself, in shaping my life more effectively, and in directing my energies more efficiently. ... there is no question that had a tremendous impact on my career, professionally and on my life."

— pro football hall of famer, actor, order of constantine and significant sig merlin olsen, utah state 1962

sigma chi transformational leadership philosophy
sigma chi transformational leadership is the practice by which leaders inspire and empower others to innovate and create change that will positively impact the fraternity and ultimately the world.

 













a letter from the grand tribune and grand historian 



grand tribune and order of constantine sig jim holcomb, cal. state-sacramento 1994, and grand historian dr. michael codina, california-san diego 1993, challenge the idea that sigma chi members should only meet the minimum admission standards instead of striving for deeper values.sigma chi's standards and virtues should guide members like essential tools on a journey. holcomb and codina encourage all members to strive for higher ideals which will, in turn, strengthen relationships and accountability. by embracing these ideals, sigma chi brothers can improve their own lives and help create a stronger, more committed fraternity.

new e-learning course for alumni reacquaints them with fraternity 



sigma chi today, launched may 1 under the charge of 73rd grand consul bob wilson, fort hays 1981, is a one-hour e-learning course that has the vision to bring all 250,000 living alumni up to speed on the fraternity’s evolution since the 1970s and how sigma chi continues to serve members today. the online course invites participants to rediscover the heart and soul of the fraternity and reconnect with the bonds that have shaped their life since initiation while also focusing on how the fraternity has needed to evolve to a new landscape and a new generation within campus life.

efforts in congress to preserve, enhance fraternal experience 



sigma chi – and greek-letter life everywhere – has been under attack in recent years from egregious overreaching by third-parties with attempts to control or limit the manner in which our fraternity conducts its affairs. work is underway to stop this intrusive behavior and, most importantly, prevent it from ever happening again — but we need your support to protect and preserve the fraternal experience once and for all
