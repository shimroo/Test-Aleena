agronomy grows here

agronomy at purdue university provides global leadership in plant genetics, plant physiology, soil and water sciences, and meteorology to enhance the quality of life through agronomic education that results from discovery, education, and engagement.
why agronomy?
agronomy is the core of all agricultural sciences. the management of soil and water, with a view to achieving production of high yielding varieties is exclusively an agronomic domain. among all the variances in agriculture, agronomy occupies a pivotal position. similar to agriculture, agronomy is an integrated and applied aspect of different disciplines of pure sciences.
