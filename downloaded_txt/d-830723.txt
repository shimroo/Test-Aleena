	 do your research when considering a credit repair company in order to stay out of finanical trouble
	 
    




as life progresses, it's easy to build up a number of debts to various creditors.  it could be a credit card, then you add a student loan, a car payment and perhaps a mortgage.  all of these debts and how you handle them form your credit history.  most of us don't even think about our credit history, until suddenly something goes wrong.perhaps you got knocked back for another loan, or you couldn't rent a car, or perhaps you were knocked back for a service unless you could provide a substantial deposit.  your credit history will rapidly become very important to you at that point, because if it's poor, these are the types of things that will happen to you.  now fixing your poor credit needs to become a priority for you.starting on your credit journey straight away is important, and it's easy to get caught up in the desperation of the moment and fall for one of those credit repair company ads which seem to promise that they can magically repair your credit overnight.  it usually costs you a pretty hefty fee for them to perform their services.  and yet it's very unlikely that they can do anything to repair your credit that you can't do for yourself.  so unless your situation specifically requires assistance from a credit repair company, avoid them and their fees.the main strategy of most credit repair companies is to request your credit report and then challenge every single negative entry that's listed.  sometimes there will be errors on your report, which makes this strategy successful, but that's not usually the case.  instead, the credit bureau has to document the entry within 30 days or remove it.  when it comes to older entries, this can be quite difficult, and so this strategy often has quick results.  however you can challenge your history by yourself - you don't need a credit repair company to do it for you, and you're just as likely to get positive results.this strategy works well initially, but most credit bureaus will continue to investigate after the 30 days is up, and if they manage to document the entry down the track, it will immediately reappear on your credit history.  so your gains may only be temporary ones.some credit repair companies will suggest other strategies which are less than honest, and it's important that you don't risk getting yourself into trouble by agreeing to things like setting up a new address or bank accounts in order to fool a credit bureau into giving you a fresh credit history.also, make sure that any fees and charges the credit repair company charges are fully documented before you agree to use their services.  you should also make sure they've performed all the tasks they said they would perform before you pay them.  and remember - read the fine print!for most people, a credit repair company is unnecessary and an added expense at a time when you're quite possibly stretch far enough financially.  so unless you're convinced they can perform tasks that you can't, or you simply don't have the time to repair your credit yourself, be very wary of signing up with a credit repair company.labels: credit, credit bureau, credit repair company, financially, fresh credit history, repair your credit

	 does your bad credit history still haunt you?
	 
    




i would love to tell you to put your past behind you but when it comes to credit your past will be reflected on your credit history and your credit report.  and that's how bad credit gets started. however, other contributing factors can well have an adverse effect on your credit and you'd best know what they are.most of your bad credit problems arise from bad management of your finances. missing credit card payments, defaulting on your secured loan, declaration of bankruptcy are the primary red light factors that alert lenders to the fact that you are a  bad credit risk.  the frequency and pattern of such behavior in the financial arena mount up to give an unflattering picture of you in your credit report and will depress your rating.some of the other factors that can give you negatives against your credit rating are your marital status and whether you have children. not much you can change there!  it isn't just what you do with your money that comes up on your credit rating - you can have a rating that is less than perfect as far as a lender is concerned regardless of your payment history. but the best thing you can do is to first to make sure that the credit history being shown against your name is accurate. check the report very carefully and get the errors corrected.regardless of how your bad credit rating arose, you look less attractive to lenders when you apply for a loan than someone with a perfect history. most lenders will do a quick check of your rating when you apply for a loan.  a rejection may occur on this first screening.  the trouble with that is that each time you make an application, a turn down is recorded every time there is a rejection.  the consequence is that your rating suffers accordingly.  in view of this you may want to see if you can find lenders who will pre-qualify you without you entering the application process.one thing in your favor is that a larger number of lenders are prepared to work with you despite bad credit problems in your history.  some firms even specialize in bad credit loans.  the corollary is that they charge higher rates and make bigger profits. the international online companies are usually better set up to work in this area than are local banks and credit unions, so select your lenders carefully and don't make an application until you are fairly sure you will be approved for a loan.you need to be prepared to do your homework well before you finalize on an application.the well known online lenders are set up to allow you to compare rates and costs and are well used to the questions you may have.  some of the brokers make this process even easier with comparison capability built in to their process. since you have bad credit, you need to be smart in your shopping.  carelessness at this stage will not only cost you dollars and cents but may contribute to making a bad situation even worse.  be diligent and an educated consumer and avoid damaging your credit further by filing too many applications.labels: bad credit loans, bad credit risk, credit history

	 how everyone's poor credit affects all of us
	 
    




today it is our desire to take a look at a thought we mentioned earlier. "we are all in this together."  what, we may ask, does my poor credit have to do with our neighbors?  what does our neighbor's poor credit have to do with us, when we have a clean record?what can "we are in this together" mean?  how can our financial affairs be anyone else's business?let's reason together for a moment.  we have two communities with the same environment, population, and business opportunities.  on the outside one can't see any differences.  however, let's say community "paidfor" has taught their citizens to live within their means.  they work, save, and pay cash or wait to purchase. they do not end up paying interest, fees, or charges, keeping their earned money. they have moderate happy homes and compact cars, and are great workers.the other community "justmakingit" pays for everything with plastic. their citizens have a hard time paying all of their charges.  yet, to look at their community they have a lot.  they have the big beautiful homes, luxury vehicles, and everything they wanted, except it is all on plastic.  their citizens are having challenges.  they have late pays, charge offs, and bankruptcies and a lot of unhappiness in their homes, with co-workers and in their community.  they pay high interest for everything they own including their entertainment and eating out.think, which community do we think the bankers are most happy with, the one who pays for everything or the one who pays interest for everything?which community would we and our families find the most desirable to live in?here is our new word for the day, fractional-reserve banking.  how many of us know what it means?  how it is affecting our lives and our communities every time we have an open credit card account, take out a loan, or deposit money?when we use our plastic instead of cash what is the ripple effect?  is this ripple effect what we are blind to, causing us more harm than good?according to wikipedia, "fractional-reserve banking, refers to the common banking practice of issuing more money than the bank holds as reserves."friends, thinking is very good for us.  for example: we have 10 apples on the counter.  a friend comes in to borrow 20. how can we loan out 20 apples when we only have 10?  how can a bank loan out more than it has reserves?wisdom is a virtue we all must have to live happily.  this week let's all search out what the consequences are, when we and our neighbors bank with a system using fractional-reserve banking system.remember in history when people died for saying the earth was round and not flat.  remember the doctor who discovered doctors should wash their hands between patients, had to give his life for his belief.  are we living as dangerously as patients were, when doctors didn't wash their hands believing it wasn't necessary?let's honestly ask ourselves can we keep doing the things we have been doing, the things we were taught by society, by the media, by our educational system and end up in a financial disaster without it affecting all of us, aren't "we all in this together?"after we do our due diligence on the fractional-reserve banking, let's ask, are we the dominator or are we being dominated by the banking system?are we happy when we are a dominator or being dominated?  is there a way of living without being dominated or a dominator?till next time dottiedee here encouraging each of us to move forward today.labels: credit, credit repair, credit report, ever thought possible, food for thought, habit, power of thought
