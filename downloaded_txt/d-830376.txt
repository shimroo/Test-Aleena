gq: the strain's mia maestro explains why vampires are so damn sexy



jul 11, 2014

the way of teacha dao is a path to enlightenment by "the way of tea" through the practice of emptiness. it comes to us through ancient chinese lineages. when we drink tea in a sacred ceremonial space, we can feel that we are a part of the nature that gave us the tea, while it streams into us and becomes our body, mind, and soul. tea is a gentle medicine that brings us awakened presence through our everyday lives and allows us to maintain sustained states of meditation.mia is a student of the leaf and is of service to her through facilitating tea ceremonies around the world within private and workshop settings.read more
