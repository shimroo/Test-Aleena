cross-border employment solutions









the complexity of cross-border employment is real and the stakes are high.







expand your business into canada quickly, safely and with zero hassle.






if you are looking to expand your business into canada but have no experience in canadian employment, cross-border employment solutions  are what you’re looking for. don’t let employment regulations, high-risk liability, or administrative hassle get in the way of your success. we assume all employment administration and liability risks in canada as the employer of record, so you can move ahead quickly, confidently and worry-free. say goodbye to on-boarding, off-boarding, collecting time sheets, running payroll, handling employee relations or any other aspects of the employment life-cycle. we will hire the best person for the job, so you can focus on what truly matters – your growing business.









improve your bottom line with
a managed contingent workforce



whether you need to reduce labor costs, grow for seasonal demand, or expand into a new region, contingent workers are the perfect solution. access your optimal support staff only when you need it. we hire and manage your extended workforce of independent contractors, rehired retirees, or qualified on-demand project specialists. you get the workers you need to meet the demand of your company – all without investing large amounts of money or time in full-time recruitment.
managing people is no easy task. with a contingent workforce in place you can say goodbye to on-boarding, off-boarding, collecting time sheets, w-2s, 1099s, running payroll, handling employee relations or any other aspect of the employment life-cycle. our proprietary online portal offers both you and the employees real-time information that is a click away. now you can focus on what truly matters to your organization – your growing business.
