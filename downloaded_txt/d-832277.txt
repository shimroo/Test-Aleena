traditional reading programs fail many children 






by 4th grade, up to 70% of children are not reading at grade level. most reading programs skip over important skills and don’t engage the whole brain, body and learning strengths.
those programs work for the 30% of the population who are natural readers, but they don’t work for everyone.































it’s not your fault or your child’s fault. they have just never been taught to read in a way that works for their learning strengths.




























reading is an emotional topic for many parents 






whether or not you yourself had challenges learning to read, it can be heartbreaking to watch your child struggle with this important milestone.
it’s common to feel



















frustration that your child’s school isn’t helping them. 





 











guilt that you’re somehow failing your child. 





 











worry your child will struggle in school and life. 





 











sadness that your child might never love reading like you do. 





 











overwhelmed because you don’t know what to do.





 
























open reading engages the brain and body to match the different ways people learn.






we’ve been teaching, testing, and refining these principles for 40 years. this method has been used with over 100k children in classrooms across the us, and has been proven to be a more effective methodology for children who struggle learning to read. no other reading method teaches all of the skills or builds skill by skill in a progressive manner like open reading does.

open reading is not an app






we know you don't want to just sit your kid in front of a screen and hope for the best like most non-school programs. we use screen-based technology to make this program accessible and convenient, but the physical and musical activities and games are the secret sauce that engages children more fully.
