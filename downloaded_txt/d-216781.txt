				e-missionsâ¢ are simulated, problem-based, learning adventures delivered right into the classroom via distance learning technology. with the use of the internet and videoconferencing equipment, these âliveâ scenarios are conducted in your classroom by a flight director at mission control from the challenger learning center at wheeling jesuit university.
			






				e-missions are great tools for teachers to motivate students to learn math and science while at the same time meeting standards and objectives in the classroom. each e-mission provides a website with standards-based materials, activities, and lesson plans to help you prepare your students pre-mission. the website also provides all the mission materials needed for the culminating live event on mission day.

			the e-mission is a student-centered, team-based, interactive educational experience that uses scientifically accurate data to solve problems. your class will assemble as an emergency response team and then connect via technology to the flight director at mission control. all teams work together with mission control to handle the problem situation as the scenario unfolds. every few minutes new data is received in the classroom via satellite and your teams perform calculations, create graphs, and assess the situation. the expert teams in your class then make recommendations to mission control based on their analysis.

			on mission day your class will turn into a hub of activity as your students use teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills to avoid disasters and save lives. research indicates that this way of learning leads to improved critical thinking skills. the impact of this fast-paced, engaged learning environment will help you create lifelong learners in your classroom.
