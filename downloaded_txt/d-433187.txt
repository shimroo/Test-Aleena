wine 201

 

we get questions. we get requests for media articles. we get asked to explain. we occasionally have an urge to opine. and over the passage of time, it is not unusual to find the same question, request, or plea for an explanation to cross our desks a second time. so in the spirit of providing solid, reliable information about all things wine, we created this blog.
