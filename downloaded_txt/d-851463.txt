creative media dragon parade. a spectacular dragon will parade from the cityu main campus to the creative media centre in the building designed by daniel libeskind (run run shaw creative media centre), where a ritual dragon dance will be performed. the head and tail are of a traditional chinese dragon, while artist tjebbe van tijen has designed a new body for it. built by dragon master wu da lai, its 99 scales show images contributed by students and staff of cityu. after the parade the dragon will transform itself into a huge banner that will be slowly raised up inside the creative media centreâs nine-floor-high iconic stairwell. the banner shows an undulating visual display of dragons in search of wisdom pearls, diving to the bottom of the oceans and flying up to the stars. this banner hoisting performance was filmed in 3d and projected live in the creative media centreâs multimedia theatre, at the concluding event of the grand opening ceremony.

art action academia 1964 - 2014
		      a growing documentation system of events as products of shifting collaborations, set in their esthetic, social and technical context




the second on-line version (launched 21/02/2010) of the aaa documentation system. it has 147 events starting with the amsterdam street happenings of robert jasper grootveld in 1964 that set a new stage for other forms of creativity and critical action and ending with a street happening at the same spot 45 years later being grootveld's funeral. the basic ideas for the aaa documentation project have been formulated in an essay by tjebbe van tijen "art~action~academia 1960-2006" published in may 2006: "starting point has been my own involvement in such events, often products of collaborative work. tracing back crossing paths, producing a reconstruction that can not be complete, but will still be inspirational. documenting, like the weaving of a social tapestry ...."

			        japanese mythology comes to live again and again when the the giant catfish namazu brings about earthquakes and tidal waves, roaring the underground of the sea and the primordial god takemikazuchi needs to be called in to drive a 'head stone' (koname ishi) on the fish to get it under control. namazu and the thunder deity takemikazuchi are both feared but they can also be bringers of wealth as the chaos which enfolds does hurt the rich more than the poor and social upheavals that change the world may be triggered by great natural disasters (yo-naoshi, relief of the world by social reform).






namazu was also the name of an early ecological magazine published by a group of anarchists based in osaka at the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties of last century. their editorial reads: "namazu: the japanese word for 'catfish'. a giant catfish is said to sleep beneath the japanese islands, and the earthquakes caused by its frequent stirrings are said to indicate heavenly displasure with the authorities. recent scientific experiments have proved the old folk belief that namazu can be used to predict quakes by observing abnormal behaviour patterns among the fish."


			        several issues of this pioneering critical environmental magazine (published in english) have been scanned and will be put on-line soon, being a first of a series of documents that show how over the last decades a critical undercurrent did exist in japan, whose voice has been heard not enough....




 













december 2009: museum-bike (museumfiets concept imaginary museum projects 2008/2009) whereby  an equipped cyclist  travels through time, space and mood on the basis of citations from the literary arsenal and heritage of a city. hundreds of authors and the time/space evenst described by them over  centuries can thus be experienced. it is an adaption of the principle of "literary psycho-geography" which i have been developing for the last 30 years. visual feed back via a touch screen in the handle bar and audio-feed back via special earphones that do not block off traffick awareness sounds. 

			        this example is an  adaption made for the copenhagen 2010 cityplan   by y-yech/amsterdam (luud schimmelpennink, bert lonsain, a.o.) with their new type of electrical bicycle (white bike/witfiets) and  electrical city car (white car/witkar) vehicles distributed by the use of smart parking poles and smart personal phones. a 21st century adaption of the original white bicylce plan launched by the amsterdam provo movement in 1965. luud schimmelpennink has for fourty years propagated this idea with several working pilot projects in amsterdam. the socalled 'white bicycle plan' of 1965 has in many ways inspired concepts and practices elsewhere in the world from yellow and green to black bicyle plans. in 1969 the first protype designed by schimmelpennink of an electrical city car drove through amsterdam baptized 'witkar' an idea now on the agenda of some of the major cities in the world. now a 2009 redesign of that car has been made by y-tech in collaboration with industrial designer bert lonsain. the new whitebike design also proposes a environmental conscious mode of driving. real time display of mappings of city air quality will be combined with sniffing contraptions build into the bike that both deliver feed back to traffic & air quality map services and signals the actual at-the-spot-state of the environment through a set of five bright led lamps in the frame of the bicycle, vsible both for the cyclist and the passersby. click one of the pictures above for a link to the full y-tech copenhagen city plan report (museum bike = pages 9 & 10)....

on january 15. 2009  a "whitebook squatting" (witboek kraken)  has been launched produced by a collective of the ever rejuvenating dutch squatters movement (now in its 40th year of existence). this whitebook that tells the mostly positive stories of 80 squats in 20 different municipalities in the netherlands is a reaction on on a publication by a member of the dutch liberal party (vvd) bas wout in november 2008: "blackbook squatting" (zwarboek kraken)this last publication focuses solely on a series of 24 recent cases in the amsterdam region where violence and confrontational situations have occured, which are - by its author - all blamed on 'the squatters movement' as a whole, leaving aside the individual responsibility of people involved in these incidents: squatters, strong-arm-gangs, residents, home owners, police man and women, and, bystanders. the vvd blackbook is part of a strategy of some members of parliament (liberals and conservative christians) to outlaw suatting as such, making it into a criminal offence.

			            in 1968 i was part of a group of people that founded a playful enterprise "woningburo de kraker" (housing buro the squatte/kraker: literally crack, break open, tear open, a burglar's term in dutch). it was the start for an organized way of squatting in the netherlands, with a manual explaining both practical ways how to force open a closed door and the juridical arguments one could use to stay on once an empty house or space had been turned into a new home. the cover design of this "handleiding krakers" was of my hand, the silkscreening by rob stolk (a central figure in the dutch provo movement who sadly died now 8 years ago). a digital facsimile of the 40 year old squatters manual will be on-line soon ... the witboek kraken can be purchased via this link

the picture at the left summarizes an exhibition "sgraffito in 3d" (decorated ceramics by scratching drawings in a second layer of white clay laid over a red clay body before final glazing) by media artist joachim rotteveel, presented november/december 2008 at the boymans van beunigen museum in rotterdam . sadly, this installation that is dedicated to a particular part of the collection of the boymans museum, has only been on show for two months which is somehow wasteful when one takes in account the amount of research and financial investment that has been put into it. one wonders why - in a more compact format - this new way of museum object presentation has not been integrated in the permanent show of boymans van beuningen. could it be that curators still - unconsciously - fear an approach whereby the museum visitor is not just 'eyes', but also has 'hands' that can take up, touch and ,manipulate objects?

! colombia: hasta la violencia siempre ? a statistical context of the freeing of ingrid betancourt
			        at the beginning of july 2008 it was world news: the colombian army rescue operation - based on trickery - that set free 15 hostages from their captivity by the guerrilla organization farc. one of them was ingrid betancourt, imprisoned since 2002. in her public appearances after her miraculous liberation betancourt always points at all those  captives left behind. the numbers mentioned in the news and the campaigns around betancourt were confusing (some campaign posters had the number of 3000 hostages, but that seems to refer to the total number of hostage at the peak of the kidnapping around the year 2000, while the actual number of hostages now according to other sources is to be counted in the hundreds). this made me wonder: "how many kidnapped captives were there, during how many years; how many do remain in captivity; who is imprisoning them for what reasons; what will be their fate in the light of urbide government policies?"

last resort for a haunted man is to hide behind his beard covering a face that became a public icon ~ once his zeal is betrayed and his cover is torn, it still will take generations before his defaced idol has vanished from all shrines. to ridicule and make laughing stock out of a former ennemy is missing the opportunity to come to an understanding why it was that such a man could hold such  power ~ it is failing to learn a lesson how to prevent it happening again and again

"agitpop 1968-2008 - activists graphics, images, pop culture" is an exhibition curated by john phillips of the london print studio  that opened in february 2008 and will run untill may 31 2008 at the gallery connected to london print studio at harrow road 425, london w10. john phillips is one of the co-founders of the forerunner of the london print studio: paddington printshop, starting in the mid seventies. it combied social action with graphic arts, having a big impact on the history of the padington neighbourhood with its actions against property speculation and inititiaves for communal facilities like meanwhile gardens, a park created by a "grass-root" movement, famous for its pioneering skateboard piste and still a lovely spot next to one of the grotesque highrise public housing estates of the early seventies. as a curator of the documentation center of social movements of the university library of amsterdam i did collect over the years many of the posters printed at paddington printshop (now in the collection of the international institute of social history (iisg), amsterdam  ). two friends of mine were also in close contact with paddington printshop: steef davidson, who was the initiator of the amsterdam poster collective "vrije zeefdrukker" (free silk screen printer), and pieter boersma  , who made a photo reportage on paddington printshop in the early eighties (slides from this reportage have been reused in a big print at the 2008 agitpop show).
 this reportage was earlier shown  in the context of a poster exhibition on art and readical protest curated by steef davidson in the stedelijk museum amsterdam in 1981). a visual resume of the catalog can be found online   on my archive website. this year john phillips asked  if i would like to come up with some materials /suggestions for his exhibition celebrating the 40th aniversaty of the 68 movement. it resulted in the making of a series of five big documentary collage prints that are now part of the agitpop london show   . one is a 18 meter long print hanging from  the ceiling, a digital recycling of a series of looping slide projections  made in 1989 together with suzanne outshoorn for another poster exhibition as part of the 1989 amsterdam manifestation "europe against the current"  . there is an online catalogue of the agitpop show in pdf format with an essay by damon taylor and with an introduction by john phillips that can be viewed/downloaded by clicking here   related to this subject is a  text published, now twelve years ago, by the french sister institute of the iisg the bdic/paris, documenting a series of lectures on the roots of the french may 1968 movement ("les annã©es 68: ã©vã©nements, cultures politiques et modes de vie" ). i was asked to do a talk on "les provos"   - the dutch radical and playful movement of 1965-1967 and its reception in france - it can still be found on-line as a pdf. 















2008: museum voor communicatie the hague
"eye opener: the power of visual language" the ideas originated in an earlier show in lisboa - experimentadesign in the year 2005 - curated by max bruinsma  with designer ed annink and additional input by jan van toorn and rob schröder. logos, icons, pictograms and photographs used for persuading the public, to inform and activate. showing advertisement strategies that go beyond beauty & the photomodel  by brands like diesel and benetton, as well as anti-publicity tactics by groups like ad-busters. the  aim of the exhibition is to support and stimulate 'visual literacy'.
also in this show my installation "ideas of visual language": an associative panorama in which insights, disputes and misconceptions about image and language over thousands of years, and from many different cultures are shown on meters long scrolls. the public can handle these scrolls both in a 'low tech' and 'high tech' way: a wooden box with handles to be turned by hand and  a computerized scroll with a touch screen  giving access to one hundred documentary overlays. the redesign of the touchscreen interface has been made by joachim rotteveel. the wooden scroll boxes were originally designed for an installation on neo-shamanism  for the royal tropical institue/museum in amsterdam in 1997 by gert jan leusink and the workshop of frank hoogveld in wormer.

the installation shows collections by and about fifteen people that were either involved with the situationists or had an affinity to situationist ideas. hundreds of photographs have been taken by pieter boersma in their homes and workshops, in archives and libraries - especially the international institute of social history in amsterdam. these pictures formed the basis for 21 visual stories. many digital scans were made as well, of posters, leaflets, books, pamphlets and periodicals; personal photographs and correspondence have also been included. fred gales searched for related audio materials in historical archives. a multitude of personal associations with situationist practice and thought is represented by the installation: "situationist adrift."


the people who give access to their 'information landscape' are: jacqueline de jong, simon vinkenoog, nic tummers, robert-jasper grootveld, hans mol, roel van duijn, tjebbe van tijen, theo botschuijver, steef davidson, cor gout, iris de leeuw, tony verlaan (through his archive at the iish), jan ceuleers, and rené sanders.






the installation is a part of the exhibition "in girum imus nocte et consumimur igni" (a latin 'palindrome ': "we go into the circle by night" + "we are consumed by fire") on the lost paradise of the situationist international, a collaborative project of the centraal museum utrecht and the tinguely museum basel.

neo-shamanism an interactive installation by tjebbe van tijen and fred gales shown at the icc gallery/tokyo, 1998.
          an imaginary museum projects production. the work reviews historically different forms of shamanism - one could say a non-electronic form of telepresence -. fibre information systems from the inca age 'quipu' to glass fibre cables mark the space in which a big drum is standing as the main interface. two other interactive installations give the opportunity to relate information on the internet on shamanism with stone age creation myths. the drum is not a 'mock up' but a real percussion instrument with a special prepared drumhead that serves also as a projection screen. also there are the sixteen pictograms, printed on the drumhead at regular intervals around the border. the pictograms represent the different sequences. by hitting a pictogram with the (special) drumstick a sequence is chosen. the first image will be an enlargement of the pictogram with a spoken short title of the sequence. the sequences are long picture collages that scroll in different directions through the circular space of the drumhead and have a length that varies between one and two minutes. at any moment the user can switch to another sequence. documentation with full credits in the art action academia documentation system.
