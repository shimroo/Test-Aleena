the university of michigan’s global change courses, part of the program in the environment, offer a modern approach to undergraduate science and social science education.  in interdisciplinary courses the topic of global change from physical and human perspectives are examined, and case studies are used to explore scenarios for sustainability. small, gsi-led group sessions promote critical thinking and analysis.
the courses are aimed at first and second year students who want to understand the historical and modern aspects of global change and sustainability.  these 4-credit courses include laboratory sections and carry distribution credit.
