 grassrootspeace.org 
november 5, 2007: this
          website is an archive of the former website, traprockpeace.org,
          which was created 10 years ago by charles jenks. it became  the
          most popular grassroots peace center site in the us with about 10,000 visitors a day by july, 2007. its content remains
           an important resource on the grassroots peace movement, student activism,
          'depleted' uranium and other topics. jenks authored  all of its web pages and virtually all multimedia content (photographs, audio and video). as the author and registered owner of that site, jenks's purpose
          here is to preserve an important slice of grassroots
          peace history  over the past decade. he is maintaining this
          historical archive as a service to the greater peace movement, and
        for traprock's many friends. he is grateful for having worked with the traprock community, and particularly with sunny miller. without her supreme organizing, and her collaborations with scott ritter, doug rokke, jeremy corbyn, kathy kelly, bishop gumbleton, and a host of local and national organizers and groups, that site would not have reached the heights that it achieved.this site does not reflect the  current work of traprock center for peace and justice. traprock reorganized its board and changed its name and mission, starting in late 2007. to contact traprock
            center for peace and justice, call 413-522-8892 or visit its site.

our point is not that these marines 
                are evil; rather, that it is a war against the iraqi people.

"[a]fter all, and this is a very important 
                  thing to understand, the power of governments and the power 
                  of all large entities like corporations, rests and depends upon 
                  the obedience of people. the government and the military, as 
                  powerful as they are, cannot carry out a war."

peace poems
a wonderful time--the war:
                  when money rolled in 
                  and blood rolled out. 
                  but blood 
                  was far away
                  from here-- 
                  money was near.
