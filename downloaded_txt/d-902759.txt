      bailey motorsport was formed over 20 years ago and is  regarded as one for the top alloy fabrication companies for race, rally and  road cars worldwide. born in the late 80’s, bailey motorsport products quickly  became the number one choice, whether it be a complete high pressure cooling  system for a 550+ bhp race cosworth engine or our now legendary piston dump  valves for your road car.
always the innovators in our field, bailey motorsport were  the first company to offer a full range of fabricated alloy header tanks, oil  separators, swirl pots and piston dump valves for the ford cosworth and rs  turbo range. race proven on our own track cars, you can be assured that every  bailey motorsport product has been extensively tested to make sure that the end  result is the highest quality, best-performing part for your car.
often imitated, but never equalled, bailey motorsport still  set the standards others aim for. our in-depth knowledge of all things alloy  has granted us an industry position we are proud of and intend to keep. today  we have a broad range of products for many different vehicles and are also a  major samco hose distributor, supplying much of the industry and helping with  development.
