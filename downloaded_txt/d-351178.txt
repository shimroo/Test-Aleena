dr. madahar is a professional with a passion for his patients. on a number of occasions he has demonstrated a high degree care for my back and neck pain from a car accidents and numerous sports injuries. i would have no hesitations of recommending him to my friends, relatives, or anyone in pain.

always feel like i have been to a yoga class, massage and chiropractor after seeing dr. madahar. adjustments are intense but work for my body. i actually feel realigned when i leave his office and have referred many people to him. only wished we lived closer, only get to see him when we are in van for work.

i have been a patient of dr. madahar for many years and can easily say he is a part of my successful health. as a dance teacher i often put my ribs out and strain various muscles, dr. madahar guilds them back into place and relieves any pain i might be enduring. i always leave his office feeling taller and lighter.

i have been a patient of dr. madahar since 2000. he has been consistent in giving me his undivided attention and continues to treat me kindly under his care. i live out in maple ridge and feel that it is worth my commute to be seen by him. if you are looking for a no-nonsense safe, direct and honest chiropractor who is experienced and talented, i recommend you book an appointment today. enjoy the adjustment and advice.
