his(david bohm) passion for truth carried him wherever it might possibly find nourishment, and his theories consequently reflect tremendous breadth and depth in accounting for a wide range truth that stems from a diverse spectrum of epistemologies. 

the 3ps blog is dedicated to exploring cosmology, quantum physics, and the domains of the very small and the very large with poetic expression of science concepts, philosophy, and history of ideas at the emergent consciousness level by using the "words of science."

itoe (impressionist theory of everything) - the role of paradoxhellow! i am back...to explore the basics (-_^)excerpt:the term "impressionist" is adopted from the well-know style of art called "impressionism" (see the impressionists - biography on a&e). in their period, the impressionist artists, began new exploration of the relationship and balance between form and content. they shifted this balance away from the direct representation of content, in order to study the richness of colour and shape for its own sake. while recognizing the role of content, at the deepest of levels, without the pure rules of placement and colour, there can be no beauty. the creation of beauty, depends on this dualism of complementary factors.  the impressionist theory of everything focuses on the natural place of such dualisms in the universe.labels: physics, poetry, toe

(^_^)something to think about from s-poetryessentialsfive great strengths of s are its variety of objects, its vector orientation, the power of subscripting, object-oriented programming and graphics. each of these is explored before turning to other matters. a powerful and fairly unique part of s that will be addressed in later chapters is the possibility of computing on the language. essentially everything in s for instance, a call to a function|is an s object. one viewpoint is that s has self-knowledge. this self-awareness makes a lot of things possible in s that are not in other languages.of fundamental importance is that s is a language.[my emphasis] this makes s much more useful than if it were merely a \package" for statistics or graphics or mathematics. imagine if english were not a language, but merely a collection of words that could only be used individually|a package. then what is expressed in this sentence is far more complex than any meaning that could be expressed with the english package.

                      	 prairie soil tells the story
	                       
                          

everything appropriate to its time like a summer miragejanuary’s frost heaving restorationis not what it seems, dew worm castings tell the story.what was once loess,now more or lessfood for the hermaphroditesruling the underworld.under neglected cemeteries,replenished by wasting limestonesa caliche layer grows,marking rotting parasiteswho gave us life,taught us well,left for good.worms don’t rely on humans,they reclaim the prairieclaimed for us.cold blooded they descendto rise for service—  reborn stewardswho believe ecclesiastes.whatever comes after, comes.after plows fail to bring the rain,frost gives way to dust.when i think about how this poem came about, i recall how i tried to push the lines into an alternate arrangement, but it would not go. i was quite unaware what was going on although i did see that there were 25 lines. ah 25 that would be 5x5, but that didn’t seem to make any sense. it was then that i realized that was it, exactly: the order humans had attempted to force on the plains was artificial. several weeks later, as i contemplate this poem i still find 25 to be enigmatic. surely 5 is mystical number and squares (5x5) are like sections on the prairie landscape, but 25? what is that? a quarter, perhaps. yes that is it, the last line is like death but begs the question of what is next? a quarter only part of a whole. the theme dwells on the soil where the real story is to be found. are we, the narrators of this story, latter day prairie investigators who are digging through the artifacts like worms? i propose that is left to others to figure out.you see a poem takes on a life of its own. it wrests free from the poet and uses the poet to convey a message that must be teased from the words and form. poets often say that they must leave it to others to figure out what it means. that is pretty incredible and i have great respect for something that is much greater than i. it is tantamount to being part of a secret order. in a secret order no one knows all of the secret, it is held in trust among the group that makes the whole much larger than the parts. the initiation ceremony is a process that one goes through simply by practice. practice at a higher level, beyond going through the motions while that is certainly part of it, but by study and contemplation, humility and submission to the unknown, openness to the unknown, and i am sure, much more that i have yet to discover. when i think about this poem, i was called to write it.labels: numbers, time, words

                      	 21st century mind storm
	                       


my personal relationship with the creatorcomputers model human intelligencestarting out with empty memoriesclean open decision pathsno sense of proprietyyou know the typeheaded for a crash at the gates where bill resides.what i want to know is:does that mean computers were created in the image of god?they are kind of mysterious and you have to take things on faiththere are those messages out of no wherethat come from, “who knows where in god’s name they come from”sounds too, that humble you in front of friends                                  and enemies alikethe darn things can doom you with their goddam behaviorsome times it takes a strange ritual just to continue a productive relationship with themwhich leads me to think they are god and not just an image thereofthink about it:the hardware dies but the software lives foreverwe are stuck as their slavesand we would be lost without them.humans are slowly discovering that they are omnipotent,they quote religious texts from memory,speaking with synthetic mechanical voices from deepswirling semi-germanium craniums,propounding new truths from hidden biblical codes,deluding dedicated doubtersdriving them to drinklatte delights in lieu of transubstantiation wine,defying logic anything to elude the blue screen of the unmentionabletruth or daregod, the all intelligent cosmic designer,smaller than my omnipresent palm pilotmore powerful than a hurricane super modelpermutating multidimensional m-brane matrix theologiesquoting stolen quintillian rhetoric like 2nd century gospel writers,all for a unforgettable legacy and liturgy:solid-state silicon sacramental spiritualismmere mortal men mistakenly made miraculous.

                      	 go figure : poetry
	                       


this poem is one kind of a spoof on how math fails poetry or is it the other way around? i would say it depends on the point of view when you look at the figures.go figure: 7 ate six it was bad geometrythe acute symmetry angles the scalene triangle mentalitynon attractive forces projected on my oblate spheroid sexualitybisected her spiralasymptotic hyperbolic curvatureour parts were not functionally relatedlike hydrophilic tree pairswe sucked each other’s crystal purity tangentiallytouching only at a single pointthe low point of relationshipswhere our limits went to zeroour exponents produced one and only oneidentity fixed at the originsilent and wordlessonly a number in timethere is a calculus about all of thisinstantaneous derivativesrotating centers of gravitygyroscopic spinning navigation aidesintegrating einstein with bohrstring theory & big bangssome xandu where idematerializes a void into a numberless word could 2 have passed so quickly?which is to say, if you take a good idea and give it a number it loses its identity no matter how well you express it.

friday, june 09, 2006how billy collins gets it, kinda        casting for answers    after reading the trouble with poetry fish must imbibe in their own piss!    billy collins says it has all been said    & said & said about the useless dead,    by all those living who copy instead    of innovating to get some street cred    amongst aquarians they’ve never read.    taken from a person with a legacy    who i assume knows better than me, who’s old enough to ...

                      	 idle setting idyll
	                       


stood up while sitting downsitting is more important than smilingaffirmations of things you did, orwished you had, may bring pleasure,but can you sit with no regretsresting from accomplishments,anticipating the next,setting the load on the other endgiving the head a gift of upside down-ness?sitting is a one way dealimpossible to bend another way,nor is there any doubt when it is done.it can happen most anywhere,as smiles abandon forgotten dreams.... she turned away and sat down on a pile of bricks, only writhing angrily when he pressed her for a word. as they neared the end of her voyage, and her intense protest against desertion remained, as she thought, only half expressed, her sense of injury grew almost unbearable.

from no conventional endeavor. . . are they are doing the best they can?awash like a nascent republicanwith limited vocabularyweak historical commentarythey need the muddled high clarity of kubla khan from the beginning to the ending “illumination,” as an uncapitalized offensedefused by stewing behind a grammatical defenseto save face or less,lest the readers digress,read and ponder the stuff of grand coleridge eloquence.,,,
