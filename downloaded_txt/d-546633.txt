center for human development 
chd is an interdisciplinary research center committed to fostering and advancing the study of human development and behavior about chd 












welcome





the center for human development organizes the research efforts of faculty from throughout the ucsd community and beyond who are interested in a more integrative approach to understanding human development. our mission is to advance a new, more collaborative, more inclusive, and multidisciplinary science of the developing mind and brain – focused on the resilience, creativity, and well-being of children and adolescents. together we study normal developmental processes in children as well as development in children at risk for adverse outcomes or disorders, and we pursue innovative ways of mitigating such risks or otherwise enhancing the well-being of children.
