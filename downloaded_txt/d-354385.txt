developing champions and leaders in life, in the community, and in the water





 

our mission is to provide excellence in professional coaching and programs that help swimmers achieve their maximum potential and strengthen their work ethic, self-esteem and respect for others. the capitol sea devils offers a series of graduated programs that provide quality instruction and training to all our swimmers. our coaches focus attention on stroke mechanics, conditioning, and overall physical development. competition affords the swimmers a major, but not exclusive, measurement of their progress and development.

 

competitive swim programs













we offer 9-month programs ranging from 2-4 practices per week based on the skill of the swimmer that focus on  technique and stroke skills. our 11-month programs range from 4-8 practices per week and offer an elite training program both in and out of the water. all new swimmers are required to attend an evaluation session.

clinic programs













a 9-month non-competitive program designed to introduce novice swimmers to the sport of swimming while allowing maximum opportunity to participate in other activities. swimmers must be able to swim 25 yards unassisted using both freestyle with side breathing and backstroke. all new swimmers are required to attend an evaluation session.




    more info
  



all prospective sea devils must attend a new swimmer evaluation session to receive the proper program recommendation and ensure that they demonstrate the required skills necessary to participate. to schedule an evaluation session, email admin@seadevils.org. to learn more about what is expected when entering each group, see our skill matrix here.
