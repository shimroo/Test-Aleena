press releasegoddard college to close its doors after nearly 80 years of progressive educationdecades long declining enrollment forces college closureapril 9, 2024 - today, goddard college's board of trustees announced that despite decades of dedicated efforts to sustain the institution, they have ultimately arrived at the heart-wrenching decision to close the college’s doors. facing financial insolvency, the board of trustees voted unanimously to close at the end of the current semester, citing a significant and persistent decline in enrollment since the 1970s as the determining factor that made the decision unavoidable. established in 1938, goddard college has been a beacon of educational experimentation, renowned for its radical approach to learning. for over eight decades, it has nurtured students, fostered creativity, critical thinking and social consciousness. goddard has long been recognized as a leader in educational innovation, with institutions across the country adopting many of its advances, including student work programs, adult education, student portfolios and individualized learning.“the closure of goddard college is a significant loss for students in search of an alternative, progressive higher education,” said mark jones, chair of the board of trustees. “the decision to close goddard college was not made easily or quickly. with declining enrollment and financial insolvency looming, the board was left with no other option. our hearts are broken.”for decades, boards and administrations have worked to find ways to put goddard college on a sustainable economic path. despite trying many different approaches including partnerships, goddard college could not beat the trends of inflationary pressures, demographic shifts and changing educational preferences. the closure of goddard college mirrors a trend seen in numerous higher education institutions across vermont and the nation, all grappling with similar challenges. goddard college is currently serving only 220 students, down from over 1,900 in the early 1970s. despite this closure, the legacy of goddard college will endure through its alumnx, current students, faculty, and staff. in partnership with prescott college, goddard students will have the opportunity to continue goddard's legacy of progressive education and experimental pedagogy and complete their degrees at the same tuition rate. a goddard college scholarship fund will be established to assist current students in transitioning to prescott college and potentially other partner institutions to be announced in the coming months. "we are committed to ensuring that goddard students continue to have access to a high-quality education and thrive academically," said dr. barbara morris, president of prescott college. "prescott college shares goddard's commitment to progressive education, and we are honored to welcome goddard students into our community."goddard college is also committed to ensuring a smooth transition for faculty and staff. the goddard college administration will be working closely with dr. morris to find opportunities for goddard faculty to be employed by prescott college. cabot creamery has been a partner of goddard college for years and goddard staff will have the opportunity to explore job openings at cabot. cabot will host a job fair specifically for goddard staff in the months to come. goddard college will officially close at the end of this semester. new admissions will not be accepted for the 2024-2025 academic year.  “we recognize the profound impact this will have on our students, our faculty and staff and progressive education,” said president dan hocoy. “if there was a viable alternative, the board would have taken it. but sadly for all of us, there was not. while we are closing the college with heavy hearts, this is not the end of goddard’s impact on the world. as generations of our alumnx have done before, i know today’s students will carry goddard’s remarkable legacy into the world in countless ways.” for updates, please visit goddard.edu.contact: lisa larivee1.802.821.0285presidents.office@goddard.edu
