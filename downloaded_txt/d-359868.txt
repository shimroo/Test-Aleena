-club parent
“bgcg’s after-school program is so much more than just a schedule of activities. it’s the peace of mind knowing that my son is surrounded by a group of caring staff members delivering a host of academic offerings that keep him challenged and engaged. specifically, he never knew he had an aptitude for finance until he participated in the money matters program. now he knows how to set his own financial budget and goals.”










we offer grateful thanks to our major supporters
