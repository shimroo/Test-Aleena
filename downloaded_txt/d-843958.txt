believe in what you build.


structures that serve

hi, we’re straub

we build spaces for communities to work, learn, pray and live.
we love doing it. which explains why we’ve done it for more than a century. back in 1920, ernest j. straub, sr. got to work developing churches, schools and homes in the mission hills area of greater kansas city.
today, we carry on his legacy of developing our kansas city communities through structures that serve others.


every project is custom,
every client unique.
