our mission
the mission of the wilson board of realtors® is to provide and convey responsible and reliable services which promote and enhance the ability and opportunity of its members to conduct their business ethically and successfully, and to promote the preservation of the right to own, transfer and use real property.
a common misconception 
all real estate agents are not realtors®. realtor® is a specific professional designation that indicates an agent is a member of the national association of realtors® and practices the highest professional standards and ethics.
