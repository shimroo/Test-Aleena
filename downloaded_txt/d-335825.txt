donate today “the macc fund is about more than funding science labs, research and infrastructure – it’s about taking care of the kids. the macc fund is the cornerstone (not just on the outside of the building), of the research. it’s an organization that’s enabled us to treat, create investigator initiatives, develop novel treatment and invest in human capital­­­. we’ve played on a much bigger stage in the medical community allowing us to write the playbook vs. following it.”
 
dr. david margolis,“what’s happened in our backyard with childhood cancer and blood disorder research, is phenomenal, and in large part because of the macc fund. the macc fund was the #1 reason why i came to work for medical college of wisconsin. it’s crucial as a researcher to have funding and their funding allows my staff and i to move forward at a much faster rate than others. because we don’t have to jump through hoops, we can turn preliminary data into major grants and protocol for cancer treatment”.
