the hidden cameras with motor entertainment are pleased to announce a remix album of 2009’s origin:orphan on the heels of its fifteen year anniversary entitled origin:orphan remixed which includes never-before-heard remixes from their critically acclaimed album. pet shop boys’ organic remix of “colour of a man” was never properly released until now as well as the upbeat noblesse oblige remix of “origin:orphan“. also featuring remixes by hidrogenesse, holy fuck, stuart price featuring jake shears and dolby anol, the whole album plays as an alternate version of origin:orphan and with an exact playing time of 60 minutes is a unique work of art in its own right.
