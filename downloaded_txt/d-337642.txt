audio   expertise   for  
digital   world
 telecommunications, digital and wireless engineers often add
voice to their design.  it has been proven many times that sound quality depends on designer's approach & skills -
and each product sounds differently. correct conversion of digital signals into analog and sound signals requires a set of critical skills, to ensure high voice quality in the entire chain, end to end,
under all conditions and with all settings of software controls.


audio scientific provides this critical set of skills.  we take care of all aspects of client design from dbm0 to dbv and db spl. we specialize in
audio for telecom, wireless, digital, medical and hand portable products. we 
cover
bluetooth, cellular phones, cordless, telephone handsets,
hands - free, headsets, speakerphones with a variety of accessories, echo cancellers, portable audio appliances, 
electronic book readers, noise canceling microphones plus all products where a chain of sound, analog and digital signals involved or voice capability required.


experience how easy and stress free will be your job when we take care of the 
analog end and acoustics. do not slow down your engineers with audio & 
acoustical tasks, delegate such tasks to audio scientific! let audio scientific 
expertise in analog design and acoustics work for you. let us shorten your 
design time, save you money and faster move your product to market. compare 
voice & sound quality before and after we worked 
with you. see  engineering service examples
