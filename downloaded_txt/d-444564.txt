 there is a saying that every bit of a bride's jewels is a lesson of life. 
the tikka pendant and string of pearls over the parting of hair lead you through a straight path of life. 
earrings warn you against weak ears for idle conversation, just as anklets and toe rings help you put your right 
foot forward. pearls on the nose ring never heavier than the nose to ensure your spending doesn't outweigh your income. 
and finally, a neck bowed by necklaces teaches one to remain humble, while bangles help you keep your hands stretched out for charity...

			different kinds of indian antique jewellery 

in india, one can find a large influence of  mughal/ilsamic  designs and patterns in jewellery. the mughal period contributed a lot to the rich, royal and exotic culture of india. talking about mughal jewellery, first thing that strikes the mind is its richness, beauty and elegance. mughal jewellery includes a variety of ornaments of adornment, which includes antique gold necklace, rings, earrings, bangles, chand bali, forehead ornaments  etc. these jewellery pieces are intrinsically designed with precious stones and gems and occupy a place of strong prominence. these antique jewellery pieces hold great importance in todayâs time and are liked for their exquisite designs and styles. these collective influences reciprocate the life, art, architecture and crafts of that era.  



the mughal emperors conquered most of india, and as a result, their influence also extended beyond north india. in the most natural manner, mughal enamelling and stonework were adopted by indian jewellery makers and can be seen as a strong point in jewellery from that time. some of the finest goldsmiths of that era worked under the mughal patronage and contributed a great deal in the making of delicate artistry. some of the earliest mughal jewellery shows the gradual influence of the 17th-century european style, renaissance era, etc. they are a beautiful amalgamation of islamic and hindu artistic styles. these antique jewellery pieces include antique gold bangles, antique necklaces, and antique earrings. the talent and tradition of fine and artistic craftsmanship were largely responsible in shaping mughal jewellery.
