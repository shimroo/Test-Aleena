   can't i just do it myself? 
we offer advise and tips that a simple reservationist on the other end of a phone line or online bookings cannot give you. we can take care of getting you to a destination or port to begin your travel, take care of booking all aspects of your trip (air, cruise, package tour, transfers or ground transportation, sightseeing, return flights and travel insurance), all with just one contact person.  no calling each supplier and putting it all together yourself. we keep up with the latest trends and newest information on cruises, resorts, and destinations by completing training and continuing education courses and seminars.travel research fees for professional consultation will be charged in advance of research for any trip. we welcome the opportunity to work with you to help plan an accurate & memorable travel experience. one that is tailor made for you, with your interests in mind. your initial fee will reserve your time slot to work with a highly experienced travel professional.


   travel alert 
recent travel health notices have been issued by public health authorities for  people travelling to areas where zika virus is known to occur. zika virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, although sexual transmission can also occur. symptoms include fever, headache, red eyes, rash, and joint pains. the illness is usually mild, lasts between 2 to 7 days, and affects only 1 in 5 people infected. zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects and women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should consult with their healthcare provider prior to booking travel to areas with active zika transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/questionanswers.html). as zika continues to spread to many countries, we recommend you regularly review the cdc travelers' health website for updated information: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/. guests are reminded to take enhanced precautions against biting insects by covering exposed skin, & using insect repellent. comprehensive information can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html.
