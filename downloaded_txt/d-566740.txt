women’s environmental network.


















 
wen is the women’s environmental network.
 
we are an environmental charity working on issues that connect women, health, equity and environmental justice. we take an intersectional feminist approach to tackling the climate and nature emergencies.
we support women and communities to take climate action, amplifying racialised and marginalised women’s voices, and advocate for change. 
our vision is a world where women, communities and the planet flourish because our society is equitable, collaborative and caring.
