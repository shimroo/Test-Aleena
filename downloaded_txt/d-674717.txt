welcome to belchertown public schools







powerschool cybersecurity incident
belchertown public schools was recently informed that powerschool, a software company that maintains student data, experienced a cybersecurity incident that affected its customers worldwide.  in belchertown, the majority of the data that was unlawfully accessed involved the names, dates of birth, addresses, and phone numbers of current and past students and staff.
powerschool has engaged experian, a trusted credit reporting agency, to provide two years of free identity protection and credit monitoring to affected students and staff.  if you studied or worked in belchertown public schools since the 2011-12 school year, you are likely eligible for this service. 
the following links provide important information on what happened and what you can do to protect yourself from identity theft:



to learn more about experian identityworks and to sign up online for free identity protection or credit monitoring, click here.
to ask questions about experian’s service, you may call experian’s customer care team during normal business hours at 833-918-9464.  you will need to provide an engagement number, which you can find here.
for general information about how individuals can protect themselves from identity theft, including how to request a fraud alert or security freeze, click here.
powerschool maintains a page of frequently asked questions about the cybersecurity incident, which you can find here.



please note that the deadline to register for free services is may 30, 2025. experian will attempt to email eligible individuals, but since contact information may not be up-to-date, belchertown public schools is pro-actively providing this information.
again, eligible individuals – including anyone who studied or worked in the district since fall, 2011 – can sign up for free credit monitoring by clicking here.
belchertown public schools is committed to safeguarding student and employee data, and we continue to monitor this situation closely, advocate for belchertown families, and share information as it becomes available.  please don’t hesitate to contact the district should you have any questions.
