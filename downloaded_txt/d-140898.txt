welcome to the sussex county horse show
the sussex county horse show demonstrates the excellence and commitment of the community to these wonderful animals and this traditional event. the sussex county horse show has a series of horse shows held between april and october that help raise funds to do maintenance to the facility and offer new scholarships to area students. these shows are growing and the association is constantly looking for new members to help make the shows in the future the best.
