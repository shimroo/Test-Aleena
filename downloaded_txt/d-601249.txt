"i bought the vespa primavera from magdy (new owner).  i received the best service that i have ever received from a dealership (car and bike)!!! he followed up on all of my special requests - got the top box painted in the exact match of my vespa.  he procured the helmet, side bars, and  fly screen!  my vespa is all decked out.  i go back often to the shop to have a chat and see what else is on offer.  magdy always makes time for customers ‚Ä¶ shop is always full from customers dropping in for follow up or a chat!  could not fault the service or the products!! if you want to buy a vespa .. see this bloke ..! he‚Äôs awesome !!!"


mark battisonÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥may 2023 
"i recently bought a vespa sprint 150 from magdy. i say from magdy because i always buy from people as much as from a company. i have rarely come across a more professional, gentle and supportive man as magdy. everything he did and said made sense and the experience of working with him was just amazing. i would never go anywhere else!! thanks magdy for everything."


sinead twomeyÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥apr 2023 
"thanks to magdy & his team one of my lifelong dreams, being a vespa owner, was realised today. i cannot recommend scooteria highly enough. i went to half a dozen shops and these guys made me (as a woman) feel supported and in no way silly for asking dozens of questions, which i didn't experience anywhere else. paul and the awesome mechanic (whos name escapes me) were so fantastic too. its service like this that makes the difference! i am a big fan of customer reviews and prolific with adding comments myself and i have to highlight that magdy is a new owner so without doubt ignore the old reviews that relate to the previous owner..
thanks so much magdy and team. i cannot wait to enjoy riding the new beast, a.k.a goldilocks ‚ù§Ô∏è"


john olaloÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥mar 2023 
"i purchased a vespa sprint from this dealership and they have the best deal here in sydney and affordable delivery fee. the owner, magdy delivered my scooter by himself and explained and taught me everything about the scooter. fantastic experience and highly recommended. more power to the team!"


leisa tozerÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥mar 2023 
"what a super smooth experience we had at this amazing scooter dealership. something that really stood out for my partner and i was the experience and professionalism of both the owner, magdy, and his sales team member, paul. we came in not knowing exactly what we wanted, a150cc or 300cc vespa. the guys explained the differences and then encouraged us to go and have some lunch, talk about it and give it some consideration knowing full well that many customers may not return. this gave us the opportunity to make the right decision and not feel pressured into the sale. we walked out the proud owners of a new scooter and we cannot thank the guys enough. check them out before you go anywhere else." üòäüòäüòä


michael guerinÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥mar 2023 
"awesome customer experience here. we had lots of questions being newbies and the team couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and patient with us. magdy was amazing to deal with while paul shared his expert advise with us. paul is also an instructor for new riders so his advise and guidance is worth it‚Äôs weight in gold. the team were more about sharing their experience rather than trying to sell. all in all this was a top class experience. if you‚Äôre new to scooters this is the place to go in my opinion."


catlovessucculentsÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥mar 2023 
"magdi was great to work with! took the time to help me with all my needs and questions. not a pushy salesman at all! from the first time i stepped in to just look around, to the day i decided on a vespa to purchase he made the experience very comfortable. got everything ready for me to be driving out the store on my birthday!"


bill erogluÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥feb 2023 
magdy, can‚Äôt thank you and the tech team enough for going above and beyond. i‚Äôm so happy with the vespa 300 super tech so all your patience,  advice and support was worth it in the end. see you in a 1000 klm for the service. thanks again !


matt hegartyÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥feb 2023 
"i highly recommend visiting scooteria for all your scooter needs. i recently purchased a vespa gts super 150 from them and can honestly say that it was one of the best purchasing experiences i've had. no pushy salesmen, just friendly, honest and knowledgable people who take the time to understand your needs and preferences to ensure they are recommending the right options for you"


lama zakhariaÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥feb 2023 
"the new owner magdi is excellent. when i bought my scooter from there, he drove me with his own car to make sure i don‚Äôt ride in the rain as a learner. highly recommend."


rfnÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥jan 2023 
"without a doubt, the most pleasant experience buying a scooter from here, just picked up a brand new piaggio medley 150 s. magdy is a legend and certainly knows a thing or two about moto‚Äôs that‚Äôs for sure, his team went the extra mile to have the bike ready the very next day . equally passionate about the immaculate hayabusa in the store from his ex-racing days as he is about talking to his customers & not just about scooters, you will find it hard to come across any other place to match this level of customer service!"


bryan cÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥dec 2022 
"i bought a scooter from scooteria (under the new management) recently. magdy was great. as newbie to scooters, i was very grateful that he took a lot of time to patiently explain to me the pros and cons of the different models and to keep up with my ever changing budgets and demands.i ended up with a model which suits me perfectly. i can highly recommend magdy."


jo-ann caltabianoÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥dec 2022 
"i  recently purchase a vespa red from magdy at scooteria stanmore and was extremely happy with the service i received. magdy was so helpful and nothing was a problem in helping me make a decision on the best scooter for me. i've had the scooter for a few months now with absolutely no problems and would highly recommend magdy and the team at scooteria stanmore.

"i purchased a vespa 300 tech the other day and magdy and his team went above and beyond to get everything done in time. all of them being super friendly and professional. during an informative visit prior i got all my detailed questions answered with a great deal of knowledge and extra info. can only highly recommend this place. while i have never had personal experience with the former owner, i can confirm that the new team is top notch!"


amy croucherÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥jun 2022 
"great customer service.
went in to look at upgrading my scooter, magdy (new owner) was fantastic, friendly and no bs. highly recommend."


john o'brienÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥may 2022 
"i bought a vespa 75year anniversary 300cc scooter today from scooteria. the business has a new dealer principal and they are doing an awesome job. the previous owner wasn't renowned for customer service or etiquette of any sort, so the new owners are challenged with shaking loose the previous reputation.
i honestly had a great experience with my purchase . i would definitely recommend giving scooteria a go. "mags" really know bikes and they know scooters, he'd want to know bikes cause he used to race them and win!
great people and great experience.
thx guys"


paul ponticelloÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥may 2022 
"walked into this impressive showroom filled with a full range of vespa models. the new owner magdy was extremely helpful and patient and talked me through the various options. i am now the proud owner of a vespa 300 gts and have no hesitation in recommending scooteria to anyone looking for a new ride.
a big thank you to magdy & team."


bahjatay bahwaÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥apr 2022 
"i am so glad i chose scooteria to look after me. after a fews week looking online as i live 2 hours out of sydney. i have to say scooteria is the best customer service so far. magdy is very helpful and no hard selling like the other shop. he so honest and make sure my bike arrive safe and ready to ride. he even answer email at midnight and up early to give me an updated on my bike. i would highly recommend this place and magdy to anyone who looking for a bike!!!"


christine liuÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥apr 2022 
"went into the shop a month ago wanting to get myself a scooter, met the new owners magdy and connie lee, they both were very professional and patient. they spent over an hour to explain differences between the scooters that i was interested in. helped me to try on different jackets and the helmets to find the right one for me.
i told them what i had in mind for the helmet and the jacket and they took out the ones that fit to my descriptions to let me try just so i could get the one that i wanted and was comfortable wearing it.
the communications were prompt as well. got my new one on the following week."


nicolas di liziaÓ§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥Ó§¥mar 2022
