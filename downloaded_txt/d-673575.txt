the bored irc server not working?you will be happy to know that there is a backup server on fefnet. this can be reached in mirc by selecting 'fefnet: random server' or by connecting to irc.fef.net port 6667 in any client and joining room #lexx. more detailed instructions are available here. if you do not have an irc client, you can reach the backup server using the java and cgi clients at the dark zone. the cgi client is also useful if you are behind a firewall that blocks irc ports.
