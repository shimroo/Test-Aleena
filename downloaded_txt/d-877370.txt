“the spirit of 4-h and ffa is unconquerable. we oldsters may at times lose faith. these youngsters never do. our country and our civilization are safe in hands like theirs.”— frank funkhouser


























history of the show



today, the junior livestock show of spokane has roots strongly embedded in the rich history of the inland northwest. many generations have been a part of the show, and while the livestock industry has changed over the years the number of exhibitors has remained strong.

legacy.nearly 90 years of show history can be told through the eyes of more than 5 generations of past and current exhibitors. it all started at the first annual show in 1936 at the old union stockyards with 139 exhibitors.



leadership.it is our goal to continue to cultivate leaders through ambassador programs, life skills learned on the farm, and education of sustainable agriculture for the future. by raising livestock for the show, youth learn valuable life skills and build a financial savings for collegiate education, their first car or home.



local impact.the show offers an opportunity for local, urban kids to either show an animal through their local 4-h club or ffa chapter, or visit the annual event and experience agriculture first-hand.


























cultivating generations of  agricultural leaders



today’s youth, tomorrow’s leaders.youth work with their livestock projects for several months at home by washing, exercising, feeding, bonding, and preparing their animal for the big show in spokane, washington, each year. responsibility, dedication to a project at hand, and commitment to follow through are just a few skills these young leaders learn throughout the duration of their livestock projects.in may, 4-h and ffa members from all across the pacific northwest make plans to compete at the junior livestock show of spokane. as exhibitors graduate and conclude their livestock showing careers, they use the skills learned and the connections made at the show in college and into their professional careers.it all starts here and we are proud of the impact made.
