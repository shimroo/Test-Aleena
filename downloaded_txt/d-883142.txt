with your help we can make a differenceat forgotten cats, our mission is to humanely reduce the homeless cat population and to stop the suffering of the thousands of kittens born to abandoned, homeless cats. we do this by working with colony caretakers to trap, sterilize, vaccinate, and release every cat within a colony.

kitten fosters needed!
this is the time of year when we bring in countless cats and kittens every week. currently, we are inundated with nursing mothers and babies. the kittens we would like fostered range in age from a few days old to a few weeks. we also have “bottle babies”(for experienced fosters) and weaned babies without their mother.
we’re asking our community for help. can you open your heart and home and foster a shelter cat or kittens?
if you can foster, please fill out a foster application on our website here


never too late to donate

a delaware based cat rescue group
we provide the necessary medical treatment for sick or injured feral cats, stray cats, and kittens. we are working to find homes for adoptable cats and kittens. we also provide education about spay neuter, and we are assisting other cat rescue groups with trap, neuter, and return programs.

every dollar counts
since forgotten cats’ inception in 2003, we have sterilized over 200,000 homeless cats and placed over 20,000 cats into loving forever homes!


trap-neuter-return assistance
we can help you with your feral colony. click here to learn how or to request assistance. read about or schedule an appointment at our low-cost spay neuter clinics.


volunteer opportunities
in order to provide care to the many, many animals that need our help, we need volunteers. there are many ways in which you can help our organization, from foster care to adoption center help to warehouse help to fundraising. find out more about volunteer opportunities.
barn cat program
some of the cats we rescue from unsafe conditions are not suited to be indoor house pets, but could thrive as barn cats. given food, water, and shelter, these cats could live out their lives and even help control your rodent population. they’re vaccinated, sterilized, and we’ll deliver them for free to pa, de, nj, md properties. if you are interested in learning more about our barn cat program, please email info@forgottencats.org.
