singing lessons nyc® by eleonor england
hey y’all! this is ellie! 
whether you want training looking toward professional work with or singing because you’re moved to sing, i welcome you to my studio page!
i gave my first voice lesson in 1986 (38 years ago omfg!) and since then, i’ve worked with a lot of people on not just professionally-minded voice training, but also so-called “tone deafness” and mostly my clients start with me as beginners whether they went on to sing karaoke at the holiday party or to be nominated for a grammy like 2 of them did.
 i’m also happy to refer you to a really good instructor elsewhere if the fees or schedule don’t work for you – hit me up via text!
i want to thank you for visiting our site and let you know we value you and your dreams and are ready to help you pursue them, whether they be having the nerve to sing in front of others for one song or having the stamina to do your sold-out mega-concert at the stadium.  thank you so much for your consideration!
<3
ellie
