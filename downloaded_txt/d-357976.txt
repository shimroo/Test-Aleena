abe’s carmelcorn shoppe in lincoln, illinois is truly a retail experience that combines the traditions of family with community. 
founded in 1983, abe’s has evolved into what now can only be described as incredible. our history has been a journey of expansion and growth, while always keeping the original location as the home of abe’s itself. in 2018, we completed a massive remodel and expansion of our historic downtown location in lincoln, illinois. 
for over 36 years, abe’s has operated throughout central illinois. from those locations and years of shared community, we now bring all of those years of friendships, families, and experiences back to where it all began…lincoln, illinois. (the only community that abraham lincoln actually named and christened himself.)   
abe’s is also located on the original route 66 historical byway which brings many visitors from around the world to our door. once you experience abe’s you are part of the family and community.
