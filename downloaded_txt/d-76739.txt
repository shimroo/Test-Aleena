            william byron avoids late wrecks to win 2nd straight daytona 500 for hendrick motorsports

by dan gelston - ap sports writer


william byron raced to his second straight daytona 500 victory, dodging a string of late-race wrecks that knocked out a chunk of contenders and sent the hendrick motorsports driver into victory lane sunday night at daytona international speedway. ninth in the no. 24 chevrolet with one lap left, byron  became the first back-to-back winner since denny hamlin in 2019-20. byron took advantage of another wreck on the final lap — nascar did not drop the caution and let the field race to the finish — and took another, familiar burnout in daytona international speedway. the 27-year-old byron held on to win after two weather delays totaling more than 3 1/2 hours.

            how presidents day has evolved from reverence to retail

by ben finley - associated press


george washington was uneasy about the idea of commemorating his life. he was the first leader of a new republic, not a king. and yet the u.s. will once again celebrate its first president on monday, 293 years after he was born. the meaning of presidents day has changed dramatically over the centuries. at first, the day was often unremarkable and filled with work for washington himself. now his birthday is a bonanza of consumerism and the reason many people get a three-day weekend. some historians say the holiday has lost all discernible meaning and lacks recognizable traditions. unless you want to count sales from retailers.
