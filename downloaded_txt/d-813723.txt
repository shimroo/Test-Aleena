										believe man or not, the truth is jesus christ loves you and died for you.
									
 
he came here to live among us, to suffer life just 
										like we do. but he endured much more than any of us could have imagined. he got 
										hungry just like us; slept because he was tired just like us; he got angry, 
										cried, laughed all just like us. but unlike us, jesus never sinned. not once! 
										so what was he doing here? click here to find out.
