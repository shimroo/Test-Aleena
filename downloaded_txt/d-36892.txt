about 
    us










timko ltd is considered to be one of the largest rope and 
            twine suppliers in the uk.
founded by daniel and timothy macguire some 10 years ago, timko was 
            set up to offer the general public with the best quality ropes and 
            twines that the world has to offer at a fraction of the cost of the 
            over-priced marine shops.
as boat owners and passionate sailors, the founders of ropesandtwines.com 
            found themselves wishing there was one place that, as boaters, sailors 
            and watersports enthusiasts, they could come to find all of their 
            rope needs, and at a price that suited their wallets
