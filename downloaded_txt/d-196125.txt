            what is a polar vortex? us gets a taste of the arctic this week

the associated press
18 mins ago


he term “polar vortex” usually refers to the gigantic circular upper air weather pattern in the arctic region, enveloping the north pole. it is a normal pattern that is stronger in the winter and keeps some of the coldest weather bottled up near the north pole. but at times some of the vortex can break off or move south, bringing unusually cold weather south and permitting warmer weather to creep up north. this week, parts of the u.s. are experiencing the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. weather forces in the arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the north pole into the u.s. and europe.
