the mystery in metal series (teens/adults)
ghosts and murders in victorian london.
an elderly professor and his daughter need help fighting evil. so why hire me, a lowly bookkeeper? and what drove my predecessor to madness and death?








the hal spacejock series (teens/adults)
hal spacejock: one part han solo, one part crocodile dundee ... and ten parts incompetent.
ahh, hal spacejock. you know everything is going to go wrong, but it's the how that surprises and delights.
like harriet walsh, the novels are light science fiction. if we really did live in the future, would we stop to explain every little gadget in mind-numbing detail? of course not!
and with hal being such a technophobe, his explanations would be utter nonsense anyway.
ten novels in this series have been published and are available in ebook and paperback.








dragon and chips series (adults/teens 14+)
an insane, inspired blend of high fantasy and low humour
imagine discworld crossed with game of thrones, and you've already got a grip on this brand new fantasy series.
all three titles in this trilogy are available right now in ebook and paperback editions.









the peace force series (adults/teens 14+)
meet harriet walsh of the dismolle peace force
the harriet walsh series: hair-raising adventures with good clean fun.
they're not flat-out comedy like the hal spacejock novels. instead, harriet is a smart, capable woman who just happens to be starting a new job with no help, no resources and no experience. light science fiction, not a techno-fest.
available in ebook and paperback.








the secret war series (adults)
a gripping space opera

a war has been raging for decades.
far behind the front lines, a training ship is attacked without warning, and a rookie takes the controls of a spaceship for the fight of her life.
available now in ebook and paperback!








the hal junior series (ages 8-12)
and you thought hal spacejock was trouble ...
these novels were written for younger readers, but adults love them too.
featuring cameos by various hal spacejock characters, the little trouble-maker hal junior is on a mission to dispel boredom and enjoy life to the full.
many people have compared hal junior to dennis the menace in space ...
available in ebook and paperback.
