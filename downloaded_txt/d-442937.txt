despite a fabled reputation as an exclusive winter outpost for haute cuisine and old money, the palm beaches -- stretching from jupiter south to boca raton -- are dotted with more than 2,000 restaurants open year-around and ranging from elegant and pricey to sufficiently casual for most budgets. along with a multitude of sophisticated dining enclaves, intimate cafes and romantic bistros are a delightful array of one-of-a-kind eateries from pizza places to burger joints. not surprisingly, many venues from ultra-upscale to supremely casual, are waterfront with dock space for arrivals via yacht or canoe and with menus big on seafood. grouper, fried or blackened, is a hot commodity, and it's often possible to dine on fresh catch from nearby lake okeechobee. restaurants on palm beach proper range from the new and trendy to glorious icons. ta-boo, dating to 1941 and once a favorite of the duke and duchess of windsor, is where a german submarine commander actually came ashore for a couple of drinks during world war ii, and where joseph p. kennedy (father of jfk) is said to have locked himself in the ladies room with film star gloria swanson before a subsequent repast. as a palm beach landmark, the colony hotel has transformed the polo restaurant into a top-ranked steakhouse, and the chesterfield continues to charm with its stylish leopard lounge and restaurant. newer favorites include bice, with  see-and-be-seen allure, renato's, with old world grace, and pizza al fresco, where word has it that insiders can have caviar added to slices along with the anchovies. the palm beaches are -- after all -- quite truly the palm beaches.
