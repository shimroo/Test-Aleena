about
mitchell‚Äôs nursery & greenhouse

2024 was a milestone year, as mitchell‚Äôs celebrated 45 years of growth and innovation with a major expansion. a state-of-the-art garden center in the piedmont triad that just unveiled 18,432 square feet of greenhouse and retail space, including four climate-controlled greenhouses and four cold-framed retail areas, demonstrates their ongoing dedication to offering the finest selection of plants, shrubs, and trees.
since 1979, mitchell‚Äôs nursery & greenhouse has been a source of horticultural excellence in king, north carolina. founded by judy and jim mitchell on a lot beside their home, the nursery began as a passion project rooted in their shared expertise. both graduates of north carolina state university with degrees in horticulture, the mitchells combined academic knowledge with hands-on experience to cultivate a business that thrives on quality and care. judy‚Äôs distinction as a certified plant professional underscores their commitment to horticultural mastery.
in 1993, the nursery expanded to its current location on dalton road, and with the addition of its first greenhouse in 1996. by 2001, their son, jay, brought his expertise from a large greenhouse operation in raleigh to strengthen the family enterprise. today, mitchell‚Äôs boasts 17 greenhouse bays, including 14 energy-efficient, gutter-connected structures equipped with drip irrigation and benches that maximize space while conserving resources.
the summer of 2008 marked another leap forward with the installation of an energy curtain to optimize heat conservation. in recent years, the nursery has extended its growing potential with additional land for new tree and shrub beds, ensuring plants receive the perfect balance of care and time to flourish before reaching customers.
mitchell‚Äôs nursery & greenhouse is more than a place to buy plants‚Äîit‚Äôs where gardeners, dreamers, and nature enthusiasts come together. whether you‚Äôre a seasoned horticulturist or taking your first steps into the world of gardening, mitchell‚Äôs invites you to explore, learn, and grow with us. come for the plants, stay for the inspiration.

stopped by mitchell‚Äôs for the first time and believe i just found a hidden secret in the piedmont. wow! beautiful nursery, great selections of trees/shrubs (best around), and prices were very reasonable. judy personally took care of everything i needed. 100% worth the drive from winston-salem/clemmons.
