welcome to the 
		duck blind!





dear carving 
	friends and customers,

	after 40 plus years, the time has come for us to slow down and spend more 
	time relaxing in the golden years, if that's possible. to this end we are 
	discontinuing all duck blind product lines so we can 
	concentrate on our health and enjoy time with family and friends.

 
diane and i sincerely thank all of you for your friendship and support over 
	our many years in business. between shows, classes, and our internet service 
	you all have become family to us. we will always have fond memories of 
	assisting you in achieving your carving and painting goals. thank you all.
