our mission
our approach
the north carolina boys choir and girls choir works to develop, enhance, and instill character, insight, cultural awareness, respect and self-discipline, and a love for music by direct exposure and involvement in the boychoir and girlchoir art forms. we will achieve these goals through dedication, hard work, and a commitment to excellence and the ideals of the great state of north carolina and beyond.
the choir endeavors to provide life-enhancing experiences through the study and performance of classical choral music, to inspire a lifelong enjoyment of singing, and to encourage singing both in the family and throughout the community.














a place for every voice
for over 50 years, the north carolina boys and girls choirs have provided young singers with exceptional musical education and unforgettable performance experiences. our program offers four choirs—training, concert, prima, and chamber—welcoming boys and girls from all backgrounds. with a curriculum rooted in artistic excellence, choir members build lasting friendships, attend exciting camps, and have the opportunity to tour nationally and internationally.
scholarships are available for those with financial need, ensuring everyone with a love of music can participate.
