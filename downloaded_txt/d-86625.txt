hawaii research center for futures studies
each of us has an essential role in the construction of whatever futures do come to pass. humans have never before had more influence over – and ethical responsibilities towards – the futures of our environment, our biology, and indeed, of all life. futures studies encourages the contemplation of many possible futures and facilitates dialogue between groups with competing or conflicting visions.



the hawaii research center for futures studies (hawaii futures) was established by the hawaii state legislature in 1971. it is one of the world’s most renowned institutions for futures research, consulting, and education. located within the department of political science, college of social sciences at the university of hawaiʻi at mānoa, it has been instrumental in the education of four decades of futurists, in the development and spread of judicial and educational foresight, and in bringing foresight and futures thinking to organizations, agencies, and businesses around the world.
activities of hawaii futures are overseen by pioneer futuristjim dator, who for nearly a half-century has sculpted the very discipline of futures studies. in addition to ongoing teaching, dator served as secretary general and then president of the world futures studies federation for a decade produced numerous publications on futures studies and emergent issues, and consulted with governmental, educational, religious, public-interest, military, and business organizations in over 40 countries.
