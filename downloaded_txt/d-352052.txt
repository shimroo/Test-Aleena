discipleshiphis law is love and his gospel is peaceposted on december 16, 2024december 17, 2024by coffeeswirls 

i love this time of year. the anticipation is building toward the celebration of god becoming flesh. people are preparing celebrations, complete with special treats and gifts for one another. houses are lit up in anticipation. the cold weather is just beginning and isn’t yet burdensome. movies and songs are…

discipleshiptablets and hearts of stoneposted on october 30, 2024october 29, 2024by coffeeswirls 

do you recall the account of moses placing the tablets of the law into the ark of the covenant? the law can seem so different from the society we have today, what with all the washings and sacrifices and ceremonies. but all of it points to jesus, so all of…

discipleshipon justice, mercy and walking humbly.posted on september 12, 2024september 12, 2024by coffeeswirls 

you know that verse that says to seek justice, love mercy and walk humbly with your god? i realized today that it never tells you to seek justice. it tells you to do justice and to act in a just manner. look it up in your preferred translation! i’ll be…

discipleshipisrael is a fulcrumposted on july 25, 2024july 25, 2024by coffeeswirls 

israel, or rather the idea of israel, has become an idol to some and a fulcrum to many more. the hatred of any people group absent their collective actions is sinful. the blind veneration of any people group is equally sinful. jesus made it extremely clear that he is the…

discipleshiplosing my literalism: i am the resurrection and the lifeposted on june 20, 2024may 31, 2024by coffeeswirls 

john 11 is a chapter that really shows the heart of jesus. mary and martha were close with jesus and they had a brother named lazarus. lazarus was gravely ill and i find the statement starting at verse five to be extremely profound. “now jesus loved martha and her sister and…

discipleshiplosing my literalism: we are all born blindposted on june 19, 2024may 31, 2024by coffeeswirls 

in john chapter nine, jesus heals a man born blind. his disciples asked the question of why this man had been born deficient in the way they had been taught. it was an aspect of the fall. ever since adam fell, his progeny was predisposed to error and disease. a…

discipleshiplosing my literalism: i am the light of the worldposted on june 17, 2024may 31, 2024by coffeeswirls 

in john 8, jesus offers the next of his “i am” statements. i would be remiss if i never included in this series that god has a long history of revealing himself in ways that we weren’t expecting. when god appeared to moses in a burning bush and moses asked…

discipleshiplosing my literalism: i am the bread of lifeposted on june 12, 2024may 30, 2024by coffeeswirls 

the book of john is highlighted by seven “i am” statements. the first of these is today’s topic. to set the table, pun intended, the jews were confronting jesus, asking for a sign that he was speaking for god. jesus responded that they merely wanted a meal, as the feeding…

discipleshiplosing my literalism: the woman at the wellposted on june 10, 2024may 30, 2024by coffeeswirls 

the pharisees and scribes aren’t the only people jesus encountered who were stunted by a literalism that obstructed their understanding of the kingdom of god. the samaritans were also encumbered by such interpretations. i won’t get too deep into the samaritan/jewish divide here, and i will be trimming the text…
