welcome to maxey elementary school! 



meet the principal 



holly david, principalwelcome to maxey elementary school, home of the mustangs! we are so glad you’re here!maxey elementary school opened in july 1995 and welcomed approximately 360 students. since that time an addition of two wings, additional kindergarten classrooms, a music room, and an annex have been added due to the lincoln community’s support and investment in public education. these additions currently allow our school to serve approximately 700 students in early childhood through fifth grade.our school’s namesake comes from nebraska’s first female african american state senator and lincoln board of education president, joann maxey. like joann, our school embraces educational equity through our mission of “maximizing learning for all students.” our dedicated staff have core beliefs that all students:have an equal opportunity to learnare held to high academic and behavioral standardsare actively engaged in meaningful and relevant learning, andhave a significant school relationship in order for significant learning to take place.our staff is comprised of collaborative teams of exceptional educators and invaluable support staff who are committed to nurturing each student’s unique talents and abilities. we strive to foster an inclusive and welcoming learning environment where every student feels valued, encouraged, and motivated to achieve their best.maxey encourages its students to be safe, respectful, and responsible. our school positively reinforces these school expectations and strives to celebrate students and staff who demonstrate grit while learning and growing. fostering grit in children involves encouraging persistence, celebrating effort over results, and providing support through goal setting and the inevitable challenges that accompany those goals. by cultivating grit, students can develop the resilience and determination needed to achieve their dreams and thrive in all areas of life.we invite you to explore the maxey school website and social media platforms to learn about past and upcoming events. we are very fortunate to have a strong and supportive parent teacher organization (p.t.o.), which focuses their efforts on improving programming for children. please be sure to check out their website and social media pages too. if you are interested in before and/or after school care, family service provides that service at maxey. please contact family service at 402- 580-3570 for information on site availability, cost, schedule, and programming.thank you for your interest and investment in the mustang community! we welcome each of you as a maxey mustang!warmest regards,holly davidmaxey elementary school principalhdavid@lps.org(402) 436-1153
