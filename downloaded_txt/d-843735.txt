in 1993 don frantz 
    created the world's first cornfield maze,
    the amazing maize maze
a uniquely  american
      interpretation of the ancient maze. 
since then, pathways through cornfields
have 
    intrigued
    and entertained millions.

first sculpted into a cornfield in 
    annville, 
    pa, as



an experiment in entertainment, the maze in maize 
    can  
now be found in countries around the
    globe.

special coverage by
world press like pbs, cnn and discovery,

    stories featured on the nbc  today or cbs
    good morning america 
    shows for seven out of the last
    ten years,  plus other
local, national and international media coverage 
have made many aware of this fun event. 

now finding the one closest to you will be easier.

our list will continue to grow as more of these
    walk-through 
puzzles are being planted and sculpted on farms, 
parks and fields from rockefeller center to timbuktu.
