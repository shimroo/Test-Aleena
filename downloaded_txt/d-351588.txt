											can i make shrimp gumbo?
									 	

shrimp gumbo recipe
this recipe has ham substituting for sausage, so it is lower in fat. plus, it is easy to prepare and oh, so good! 1 cup cubed fully cooked ham 1 garlic clove, minced 1 small onion, chopped 1 small green pepper, chopped 1 small yellow squash, sliced 2 t olive oil 2 c vegetable broth 2 14-1/2 ounce cans stewed tomatoes 2 t fresh parsley, minced ½ t salt ¼ t dried thyme 1/8 t cayenne pepper 1/8 t chili powder 1/8 t pepper 1 bay leaf 1 cup uncooked rice 1 small green pepper, chopped 1 small yellow squash, sliced juice of one small lemon 1 pound fresh medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 
in a large skillet, cook the ham, onion, and garlic in oil. cook until the onions are translucent (clear). stir in the broth, tomatoes, parsley, bay leaf, chili powder and peppers bring to a boil. stir in rice. reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes. cook until rice is tender (may be longer than 15 minutes). add shrimp and lemon juice. cook 5 minutes longer, or until shrimp turns pink. discard bay leaf prior to serving. 
this is a filling dish in and of itself. however, you may want to enjoy it with a fresh mixed greens salad accompanied with a vinaigrette dressing.

preheat oven to 350 degrees. wrap tortillas in foil, and warm them in oven for 15 minutes. combine cilantro, lime juice, cumin, chili powder and garlic in a glass bowl. add shrimp. stir well and marinate for 15 minutes. heat oil in a large nonstick skill. sauté onion and pepper for a 3-4 minutes, until softened. remove vegetables from skillet and keep warm. add shrimp with the marinade; sauté until just pink, about 3 minutes. return vegetables to the skillet. cook for 1-2 more minutes, until heated thoroughly. spoon mixture on to warmed tortillas. top with fat-free sour cream and salsa as desired.

shrimp cooking tips
shrimp is a versatile seafood that can be grilled, steamed, baked, poached, boiled, and fried. here are some other facts to know when cooking shrimp: 
 in general, a serving portion size is considered 1/3 to ½ pound of shrimp per person. add some green tea to your poaching or boiling liquid for a delightful taste. 
no matter how you cook it, shrimp is an excellent source of protein. it also is a low carbohydrate, low fat, and low calorie food. it is a source of omega-3 fatty acids, also. shrimp also contains high levels of vitamin b12, zinc, iodine, phosphorous, potassium, selenium and iron and have smaller quantities of calcium, magnesium and sodium. many of these vitamins are essential for healthy skin, bones and teeth. 
 shrimp can be green, pink, brown, blue, white or yellow in color before cooking, and turn pink with white meat after cooking. the most popular types are: brown, pink, and white. most of them are caught from the atlantic ocean. 
 cold water shrimp are preferred for cooking since the meat is noted for being more succulent and of better quality than warm water shrimp. (atlantic shrimp – as sold in red lobster – is cold water shrimp). 
 shrimp are normally graded by size and count, meaning the average number of shrimp to make a pound weight. the higher the number, the smaller the shrimp. 
 not a shrimp cooking tip, but a buying tip (and general information shrimp tip): 
 shrimp per pound: 
 10 shrimp or less = 	colossal 
  11 to 15 = jumbo 
  16 to 20 = 	extra-large 
  21 to 30 = large 
  31 to 35 = medium 
  36 to 45 = small 
  about 100 = miniature
