“doughnuts of the gods”“taste anything from doughnut plant once, and you’re hooked.”“if doughnuts were a religion, this would be its cathedral”google customer review★ ★ ★ ★ ★





all natural
at doughnut plant, natural simply means food made using authentic ingredients and methods. that's why we created our sourdoughnut™ line of products.  we make our own 100% natural wild yeast starter to create our first doughnuts made with no commercial yeast. the method is popularly known as sourdough, but this implies a process, not taste. when the process is followed properly, the taste does not have to be sour. our doughnuts are made fresh daily with the highest quality all natural ingredients.  real ingredients. no preservatives, no artificial flavorings and no eggs -- ever! (not even in our cake doughnuts or cream fillings!) flavor selections change regularly, so stop in and check out what's new. we do our best to keep our signature flavors in stock each day, but all doughnuts are subject to availability.
