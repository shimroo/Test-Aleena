clark’s storyclark’s story “clark’s outpost is run with the very same enthusiasm today as in 1974, with a tradition of outstanding food and a friendly staff. founded in 1974 by the late warren clark in tioga, texas. warren had a vision for true country bbq and brought that vision to life. it was his belief, and now ours, that for the meat to taste it’s best, a carefully crafted slow-smoke process had to be adopted, allowing ribs to smoke for 8 hours while briskets slow smoked.
