manufacturing support
acorn works with clients to identify the best cm for each product’s unique requirements. we transfer our in-depth knowledge of a product’s design – from identifying critical to function dimensions, and tolerances analysis, to the impact on the product if changes are requested by a cm to improve manufacturability/yield.

explore.at acorn, listening deeply and engaging inquisitively are key components in how we approach our product development process. we first take the time to get to know our clients and their product development goals. we then design bespoke programs to match the uniqueness of our clients and their challenges. the key is understanding and empathizing with our client’s target market so we can appropriately explore products and services crucial to our client’s success. 



execute.this is reflected in our two main competencies, user-centered design, and product engineering. ucd helps us to realize the intent of the product, while engineering makes that intent a reality.  our approach to engineering starts at a creative place and drives to a technical solution while design begins at a technical place and drives to a creative solution.  striking the appropriate balance between these integrated disciplines allows us to execute superior product development programs and outcomes.  



empower.at the core of acorn product development, the goal is to empower our clients in everything we do, which separates the vendors from the partners.  as a partner we advocate for you in the community, help make needed connections, integrate you into our network, and educate your team on best development practices. more importantly, the partnership benefits your continuous growth long after the development program has been completed.
