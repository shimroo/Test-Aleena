make 2014 the year to honor your 
										surfing heritage.  
welcome to
										surf city, california! you can travel 
										the usa looking for a name or place to 
										hang a hat and call it authentic surf 
										city.  
what exists are several 
										cities with the actual name, located in 
										north carolina and new jersey. then 
										there are many places that consider 
										themselves surf city because they share 
										a passion for surfing. below are but a 
										few we've uncovered in 
										the search for that endless wave that 
										represents the surfer, constantly on the 
										move, going where life takes him for the 
										next thrill.  some of the great 
										surf cities worth a visit include
										
										huntington beach,

										santa cruz and
										
										san diego. 
surfing for a place to 
										vacation in california? surf city 
										vacations offer wonderful options for 
										enjoyment, recreation and relaxation. 
										
what are the 
										differences in the surfing options? 
										northern california features some of the 
										biggest waves you'll ever see in 
										california. 
										mavericks big wave surfing 
										competition is hosted in half moon bay 
										annually when the conditions are prime 
										for some 50 foot waves to ride. one 
										recent year the event actually did not 
										occur when waves failed to materialize. 
										such are the highs and lows of an event 
										that counts on mother nature for its 
										success.
there 
										are many california destinations that 
										consider themselves worthy as the best 
										surfing spots in the nation. 


santa cruz is located in northern 
										california west of san francisco and san 
										jose in the bay area. it enjoys great 
										beaches, waves, spectacular surfing and 
										is not far from the legendary mavericks 
										- half moon bay, 
										that serves up monster waves big enough 
										to pulverize anyone who gets in the way. 
										santa cruz is home to surfing 
										legends and inventors, the o'neills. 
huntington beach is located in 
										southern california south of los 
										angeles. the beaches are known for their 
										west-facing positions where they get 
										direct hits from the ocean currents. 
										this makes for fine surfing, though it 
										also can present dangers for the novice 
										surfer or family vacationers with small 
										children. hold onto your kids and don't 
										go out in the waves unless and until you 
										become accustomed to them. among other 
										warnings are to situate yourself near 
										lifeguarded beaches and if you are 
										totally new, it doesn't hurt to go talk 
										to the lifeguard on duty. 
huntington beach resident, dean 
										torrence (jan & dean) is one of the 
										kings of
												surf 
										themed music & art. dean torrence 
										performs at concerts around the globe, 
										and also designs beautiful graphics that 
										celebrate the culture he and his former 
										musical partner (jan berry, deceased), 
										used to sing about in popular songs that 
										hit #1 on the charts. 

										san diego - 
										surfing in surf-crazy san diego spans the coast from 
										the us/mexico border to san diego's 
										north county beaches. legendary surfing and names such as 
										swami's, blacks beach and leucadia are a 
										few of the spots that surfers travel to 
										when the waves are hot. in 
										the heart of san diego, beaches that 
										garner surfing attention include pacific 
										beach and ocean beach. many fantastic 
										surfers have come from san diego county, 
										home to trestles, a well known surfing 
										location.
										surfcitycalifornia.com web site offers ideal 
										vacations, beaches, activities and travel 
										accommodations. you 
										can actually surf the waves or surf the 
										web at one of the wi-fi spots that are 
										hot. surfcitycalifornia.com is a window to the world of 
										californiaa world filled with color, 
										sights and sounds that make this golden

										cruz or san diego are  perfect for
