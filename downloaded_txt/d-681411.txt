	 lance armstrong is just the worst
	 
    



of course lance armstrong thinks he's like nelson mandela. i'm not even going to waste the brainpower to think of a good analogy.

	 maradona is back
	 
    



the world cup is back, and as such so is maradona and so am i.



luis suarez going to a jail like guantanamo for assaulting 3 people over 3 years, that would be like being handcuffed and thrown in guantanamo. a 4-month suspension,  not like guantanamo.

everything. just everything.  



“once she started to work, she started to place more value in herself, 
and because she put more value in herself, she put herself in front of a
 lot of things — family, and ultimately, her marriage.”

	 dexter finale gripes
	 
    



all viewer gripes miss the ending that was preordained for the show: slowly zooming out on harrison sitting in a pool of blood, just as dexter was found.

nothing else about the season matters; i stopped watching 4 episodes ago and have only followed recaps. the whole series is dexter born of blood and surrounded by blood. i forgive everything else, but not that. 

oh well. back to the good wife i guess.

	 barack obama wins nobel peace prize and every other award in the universe
	 
    


seriously my first thought is that the new york times has been taken over by the onion and i'm going to read a multi-paragraph essay on obama as the greatest man ever to live. which he probably is, but it still makes me giggle. i'm still not entirely convinced.now back to work on my speech celebrating the 2nd and 3rd people ever given this blog's address.

	 "when it leaves here, it does not have any cocaine in it"
	 
    


best spokeswoman quote draws me out of retirement. what a strange set of studies to run, and how awesome to need to justify whether the printers impregnate currency with cocaine: money can become contaminated with cocaine during drug deals, or when users snort the substance through rolled bills. it can then spread to other cash when banks process the money.zuo said his research shows an increase in contaminated u.s. cash. in a similar study two years ago, he found that 67 percent of bills had traces of cocaine. i'm listening to:the dodos- time to die

so hooray for washington! but this gun-control language... why does it have me singing about bad- idea jeans: "we want the law-abiding citizens to have the arms--not just the criminals,"  thanks senator ensign. and now that i have kids, i feel a lot better having a gun in the house.

well if this doesn't make you sick to your stomach, i don't know what will:once, he said wistfully, he made $1,300 on a single transaction, when a religious charity needed to convert $8,000 in donor funds to zimbabwean dollars.oh, development

	 give it up georgia
	 
    


can you believe the nerve of some people, questioning our societal right to put people to death as a punishment for their crimes: “unfortunately, you have people who say they’re willing to consider the death penalty, but when they get on a jury, it becomes clear that they’re actually death penalty opponents,” said representative barry a. fleming, a harlem republican who twice sponsored efforts to revoke the unanimity requirement.i want to say something more sophisticated than 'jerk' or 'douche', but i'm really having trouble this morning not being angry that someone can be upset that anyone could come in to a trial perhaps undecided, and then come to a decision that maybe, just maybe, the death penalty isn't an appropriate punishment.brian nichols' crimes are heinous. but he can sit it out.i'm listening to:puccini- madame butterfly.

	 maradona breaks the blog silence
	 
    


ok, i know it's obama day and go vote and this is a blog, but come on:maradona is back. hell yes:in 1994 and 1995, he piloted two argentine club teams to just three wins in 23 games, and he was once forced to call the shots from the stands because a suspension for ephedrine use prevented him from sitting on the bench.i'm listening to:biostatistics. plus ca change plus c'est la meme chose
