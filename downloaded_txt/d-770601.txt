how i made mario kart 7 engine in opengl over the weekend









                by gregsidelnikov, posted at may 7, 2017, 6:02 p.m.
            

actually, this post is not about how i made mk7 in opengl, but what the results were. i am currently porting it to webgl as well. the level design geometry is so simple, that it might work in 4k. but we'll see.
go to this link to arrive at webgl tutorial site, which is now home for the mario kart engine demo.
the entire level was designed in blender this weekend.
follow camera was the most fun to program, i added a little sway factor when the left or right keys are pressed.

rats! webgl hit a snag.









                by gregsidelnikov, posted at aug. 1, 2016, 8:39 p.m.
            

i've been working on studying web gl and i spotted a recent chrome message when the browser is mis-configured. i guess chrome developers had a good sense of humour and when this happens a pop-up message saying "rats! webgl hit a snag." is displayed just below the address bar on a yellow stripe.
to see how this issue can be overcome, plus an insight into some hidden chrome settings config, i created this brief youtube video tutorial rats! webgl hit a snag, i hope it helps someone out there who is facing this issue in their browser.

how to initialize webgl









                by gregsidelnikov, posted at oct. 6, 2015, 7 p.m.
            

so, we've all been fiddling with opengl in a desktop environment. and some of us have probably already heard of webgl, but never got a chance to work with it.
this led me to record how to initialize webgl in 11 minutes. after watching this tutorial, you would have your basic blank "3d canvas" box cleared to black background.
hope this helps someone out getting ready to transition to webgl.

watch how valve and nvidia ported source to linux (and gl!)









                by gamedev, posted at april 9, 2013, 2:19 p.m.
            

there is a really interesting video from the recent gdc 2013 conference that goes into detail about how valve and nvidia ported the source engine to the linux platform. the majority of the talk focuses on the port from d3d to opengl. there is nothing but glowing praise for opengl throughout the talk. definitely worth checking out!

mesa 9.0 released with opengl 3.1 support









                by kazade, posted at oct. 9, 2012, 9:54 a.m.
            

mesa, the open source opengl implementation has released a new major version which includes support for opengl 3.1. the release announcement can be found here.
although mesa works on multiple platforms, including windows, it's on open source operating systems like linux where it is most important. on linux, mesa provides hardware accelerated opengl when running open-source graphics drivers. this means that if your graphics card is supported, you will get hardware-accelerated opengl 3.1 out-of-the-box on operating systems such as ubuntu and debian, even when running from a live cd or bootable usb stick.
