	 the new year with modelsearch nyc
	 
    


model search nyc kicked off the new year with an amazing model expo in charlotte, north carolina.  over 30 agencies converged into the massive ballroom to meet hundreds of potential models  to expand the frontiers of the modeling world with new talent.  modelsearchnyc put up over six hundred thousand dollars of its own money to give the best chance possible for those who were serious about a career in modeling.  boy, did it work!  any onlooker would have been amazed as they saw dozens and dozens of girls and boys, men and women walk by with the business cards of the various agencies.  and now dwight agnor is out to do it again.  dwight is spending his own time and money to personally meet people who want to pursue a career as a model.  currently open calls are being held in florida for free.  for times, dates, and locations just visit www.modelsearchnyc.com

	 new chicago date
	 
    


dwight agnor's model expo & model search nyc has introduced another exciting and innovative concept.... all ct finalists who attend a model search nyc open call will receive a free photo shoot with a top photographer. obviously, an undertaking of this magnitude (a complete photo shoot for all ct finalists attending the expo) will take weeks to complete. fortunately, the westin o'hare hotel (the host of the chicago model expo) has agreed to reschedule the event one month later than the original date of july 29th. the new date for the model expo will be saturday, september 2, 2006.
