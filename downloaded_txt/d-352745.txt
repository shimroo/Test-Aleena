fastfriends is dedicated to placing retired racing greyhounds in loving homes in southern california.



























are you interested in adopting a greyhound? be sure to browse our website for helpful information. you can learn about ex-racers, our adoption process, and even submit an application. we do post our available dogs, but please note that you will have to complete our adoption process and choose from the dogs that match your needs and preferences. if you need any extra help, be sure to contact us!















we are an all volunteer, non-profit, charitable 501(c)(3) organization with no paid or salaried positions. we accomplish our goal through the dedication of a wonderful group of hard-working volunteers devoted to helping ex-racing greyhounds achieve a happy post-racing life. backing up our volunteers is a group of loyal supporters who participate in our varied fundraising efforts. we have re-homed nearly 4,500 ex-racers and have no plans of slowing down.































to report a lost or found dog, please call (800) 298-5743 immediately.
