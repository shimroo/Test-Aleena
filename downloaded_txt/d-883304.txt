due to circumstances beyond our control (including unexpected urgent family matters) relocating our business from california has been delayed. until we are able to relocated, we have reduced the number of products on our website to just a very few items.

until further notice, we will be selling only silkworm eggs, powered silkworm food, silkworm cocoons, and powdered yellow hornworm food.
 
note: we will now be shipping on mondays and wednesdays only.
our apologies for any inconvenience.
 

we appreciate our customers and sincerely apologies for the inconvenience.
