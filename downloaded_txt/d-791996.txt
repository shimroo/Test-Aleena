november 7, 2018


we are at war.
think logically.
why was winning the house majority the primary goal for them?
to this point, what chamber is currently directing the doj/fbi investigations?
to this point, what chamber do they feel most threatened by?
while the focus was on the house for them (due to above), our underlying focus was adding pro_potus members to the senate and safely securing a pro_majority.
the senate is worth so much more.
the senate controls judges & cabinet positions w/o house approval.
the senate judiciary committee has direct oversight over the doj&fbi [more power than the house]. […]
 
 

 



										trump smashes clinton-biden freak show as war toll climbs into thousands

september 30, 2020


a sternly worded new security council (sc) report circulating in the kremlin today noting that both the republic of armenia and republic of azerbaijan have rejected talks as the conflict growing worse by the hour between them rages on, says as azerbaijan is now claming to have killed or wounded 2,300 armenian soliders and destroyed a russian made s-300 air defense system, and armenia is claiming that a turkish fighter jet downed one of their aircraft, the continued silence of president donald trump about what is occurring is nearing the point of escalating this crisis into a global catastrophe—specifically because, and being ignored by the west, the reality remains that the russian federation has an in effect defense pact with armenia and its christian peoples—under which the russian military forces already in armenia are prepared to meet and deter any further turkish aggression—and if happens, would see russia also coming into direct conflict with the united states, as turkey is a member of the nato alliance.

								exploding leftist head pandemic feared after trump achieves coveted “victimhood” status							


								by sorcha faal in sorcha faal															
an interesting new security council (sc) circulating in the kremlin today takes a humorous turn when this transcript shows president putin asking why the new yorker magazine published an obviously fake news article yesterday absurdly claiming that putin had taken the sat’s for a young donald trump who was applying for college—a question answered by foreign minister sergei lavrov, who explained it was a parody article based on an accusation made in the book “too much and never enough: how my family created the world’s most dangerous man” written by mary trump, the daughter of the president trump’s older brother, fred trump jr., an airline pilot who suffered from alcoholism and died of a heart attack at the age of 42-years-old in 1981.

fail: washington post hoax on trump’s “top secret time travel project” 
the washington post bravely risks it all to reveal that by 2016, donald trump used his access to gen. michael flynn to quietly direct darpa, then in secret works with cern in switzerland, to commission the first  time machine ever constructed. the result? an epic rap battle between trump and anne frank.

hearst boasted fake news is the enemy of the people, causes warsnewspaper publisher william randolph hearst boasted in a cable to his photographer in cuba "you furnish the pictures. i'll furnish the war." sure enough, his papers started the spanish-american war. back in the day fake news was called yellow journalism, but it is one and the same, the enemy of the people. 




was 9/11 a nuclear event? 

 view online or download pdf.  1,000 times more damning than 9/11 commission’s 28 pages’, ‘american holocaust: 9/11 an irrefutable nuclear event, over 42,000 deaths and counting — veterans today nuclear event evidence compilation leaked fbi 9/11 evidence against bush, clinton, blair and netanyahu too staggering to ignore. if a picture is worth a thousand words, here’s some culled from thousands implicating them all, saudis included.



uncle sam sayeth unto thee 

despite its failures, the truth is the press still can save us, and even the shadow elites admit it. in the meantime, don’t count on it. remember that there is no jailer more powerful than one who can imprison your mind, and that enslavement is the job of the news broadcaster dedicated to creating a fear-based reality and not reflecting life it as it really is. 
remember that citizen journalism works, and never rely on a single source.



rare candor from the corporate media 

“there is no such thing… in america, as an independent press… if i allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. the business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. you know it and i know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? we are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes… our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. we are intellectual prostitutes.” john swinton,new york times chief editor 1880
