for the unique you!

toledo has made the head shed a landmark since our doors first opened in 1974.  originally selling incense, jewelry, and smoking accessories, the items featured in our stores have changed with the times to provide for our loyal “shed heads.” over the years we have carried anything from records and tapes, to gag gifts, to things you don’t talk about with grandma….even if she shopped here last week!
