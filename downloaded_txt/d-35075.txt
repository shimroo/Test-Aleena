manufacturing in mexico shelter services
the tecma mexico shelter manufacturing partnership (msmp) business model differs from that employed by other mexico shelter service providers in tijuana. as a part of the tecma group of companies, made in mexico, inc. understands that, while it may be an internal convenience to take a “one size fits all” approach to delivering services for manufacturing in mexico, doing so does not serve the needs of its diverse clientele, each of which are unique companies with unique needs of reducing manufacturing costs in mexico. located in the tijuana – san diego area, made in mexico, inc. embraces this approach due to shared experience of key staff, all of whom have spent time in a  mexico manufacturing environment.
as a part of the tecma group of companies, we are different from many maquiladoras in tijuana in that the service packages that we offer to reduce labor costs in tijuana are flexible. we will work with potential customers to design services packages that are tailored to meet their individual needs. our mentality is a fundamentally entrepreneurial one.
in addition to the shelter services in mexico offered by the tecma group of companies, we provide trade security services through our command center providing optimal situational awareness. through a common operating picture, industry partners may ensure efficient logistics and understand critical path kpis for on-time performance.
we invite you to visit our tijuana, mexico shelter manufacturing facilities.  tecma-west (made in mexico) call  (619) 710-0555.
