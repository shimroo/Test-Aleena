exciting changes in the school of engineering - introducing two new departments
the school of engineering is embarking on an exciting new chapter with establishment of a new five-department structure, effective from 1 august 2024. the department of mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering (mace) will be reorganised into two distinct departments:

department of mechanical and aerospace engineering
department of civil engineering and management

this new approach is designed to enhance the school’s teaching and research capabilities, benefiting our students, faculty, and cross university and external collaborations. find out more on our blog.
