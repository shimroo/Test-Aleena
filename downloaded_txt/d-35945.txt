a basic rule of 
					salesmanship is you market to the people who have the money. 
					but, a raw truth is: most people don't think about 
					personal safety until they have a pressing need. this 
					immediate need is usually combined with the lack of 
					thousands of dollars to buy a high-tech security service, 
					hire a lawyer or a bodyguard. 
the no nonsense site will provide you free, 
					easy-to-use information to keep you safe from violence and 
					crime. our goal is to give you common sense information you 
					can use right now to ensure your personal safety and 
					protect your property. we're not here to sell you our 
					products or services. any 'money making' from this site 
					comes through donations and you buying recommended 
					books/videos about subjects you want to know more about. 
					(we're an amazon affiliate.) 
we address a wide 
					spectrum of needs
					another reason for this site is to help those who have 
					experienced violence and/or crime and are trying to regain 
					control of their lives. it could have happened last week or 
					decades ago, the information here can help you put your life 
					back together.
other parts are for those in self-defense training, 
					whether martial arts or firearms. our goal there is to fill 
					in what your instructors
					aren't telling you about using your training. (often 
					because they don't know it themselves.) still others parts 
					of this site are for those who work in either violence 
					professions or public contact jobs. with the former, using 
					force is part of their job. we'll make you better. then 
					there's what we call "first contact jobs." with any public 
					contact job confrontation and maybe even violence is an 
					everyday possibility. this especially if your job often 
					includes telling people "no," or you deal with a wide range 
					of subcultures and economic classes.
putting it bluntly, violence is real, so too are the 
					consequences. we're going to help you avoid it if possible. 
					if that's not possible, we'll help you prepare to  
					handle both the violence and its aftermath.
 

					the cure is not worse than the problem 
					when it comes to personal safety, many people fear the 
					solution may be worse than the problem. and quite frankly 
					with the large number of 'paranoia pimps' trying to sell you 
					their 'ultimate self-defense system' it can look that 
					way. it can also seem very overwhelming in both how much and 
					how long it will take.
does it take decades of work to be safe? do you have to 
					spend thousands of dollars? do you need to become a martial 
					arts master to defend yourself? do you need to become a 
					paranoid survivalist in order to be safe? do you need to buy 
					a stock pile of guns?
no.
 are you going to have to learn some things to use common 
					sense? yes. and that isn't that hard. but in order to have 
					common sense in the first place, you must understand 
					what's actually involved in the problem. not what you 
					think you know about violence from watching movies and the 
					news. 
 we'll tell you right now that the hardest part about 
					learning this subject is unlearning dangerous misconceptions 
					you've been told. this includes some deliberate lies by 
					people trying to make a buck off you. for example that 
					having a black belt means you can 'take care of yourself' or 
					having a gun means you're safe. by themselves, neither of 
					those are 'self-defense,' nor will they help you with your 
					goal of personal safety.
 on the other hand, once you have solid information, then 
					making the right decisions for a situation is easy.
we take what we call the 'low impact approach' to 
					personal safety. the object of this exercise is to improve 
					the quality of you life, not degrade it. with this in mind, 
					we suggest you read 

					what do i have to do to be safe? to get an idea of 
					what you don't have to do to achieve personal safety. 
					

					in the mean time let's look at some elements that will have 
					a lot to do with whether or not you're likely to find 
					yourself in a violent situation. elements that most 
					so-called 'self-defense' training never address.
 
no push button answers       
					 having said the information is free, there are no 
					you-just-do-this fixes. if someone tells you they have one, 
					it's at best, marketing. more likely it will get you thrown 
					into prison or killed if you ever try to use it. 
the parts that make up conflict –and even 
					violence– are rather simple. you could learn the basics in a 
					day. that's not where the challenge is. it's how these 
					elements combine in different situations that is the tricky 
					part. (not the hard part, we'll get to that in a bit.) this 
					ties back to "there are no, 'you just do this' fixes" 
what is the right response in one situation is a disaster 
					in others. whether that is because it's insufficient or 
					excessive depends on the circumstances of those 
					situations; just as what made that level "right" in the 
					original situation were the circumstances.  for example 
					there are many situations where lethal force is completely 
					unwarranted and others–far fewer– where any lesser force 
					will fail catastrophically. still there are many more where 
					a sincere apology and walking away resolves the whole thing. 
					unfortunately, which is which is rather non-negotiable, so 
					proper identification is important.
being able to recognize which kind of situation you're in 
					requires knowledge and understanding. being able to 
					do-it-on-the-spot when you're in danger takes practice. but 
					even though it's not complex, it's not necessarily easy. but 
					from a direction most people in self-defense training never 
					consider.
the price of making the right choice in a situation is 
					skullsweat and self-honesty. what do we mean by the last? if 
					you're in a situation, 
					it took you time to get there. it's going to take time 
					and effort to get out -- including changing behaviors that 
					helped create the situation. that's a hard pill to swallow. 
					but there it is.
statement of fact: violence doesn't occur in a vacuum. 
					nor does it 'just happen' or 'come out of nowhere.' the lead 
					up to violence (and even crime) is a study in the choices, 
					behaviors and communication between  all  the people 
					involved. that means -- contrary to what you might think -- 
					you have a lot more power and control over what happens.
unfortunately, this is a two edged sword. yes, you can 
					prevent most violence with your words and actions, but you 
					can also provoke it. (that's why we spend a lot of time on 
					people skills, communication and controlling your emotions 
					on this site.)
while we like to think of ourselves as the 'good guy' in 
					a situation (or the aggrieved party) ...well, putting it 
					politely ... there's usually another interpretation of our 
					behavior. in fact, let's look at one of the most common 
					mistakes people make. that's threatening someone when we're 
					scared. you're saying those things to get him to back off, 
					but those also qualify as provoking and participating. 
knowledge is knowing certain behaviors provoke. 
					self-honesty is first recognizing and then admitting that 
					you did them. the hard part (remember we said we'd come back 
					to this) is developing the self-control
					not to do them when you're emotional and adrenalized. 
					this is do-able, but it takes practice before you find 
					yourself in a situation where a lack of self-control will 
					put you into the hospital, prison or the cemetery. 
understand in these days of cell phone and security 
					video, the odds are good you will be filmed. the district 
					attorney will try to use that video to convict you. you may 
					have been defending yourself, but that video of you howling, 
					barking and threatening the guy makes it look like you were 
					fighting – and you beat him up.
here's another common mistake people make. that is 
					thinking that 'what they meant to do' with an action is the           
          			 only  possible outcome. for example, nyc's nicole 
					dufrense. her last words to a mugger and his pack were, "you 
					got what you wanted! why don't you leave? what are you going 
					to do now? shoot us?"
well, now that you mentioned it. 
comfortably sitting and reading this, her saying that 
					seems the height of stupidity.
					however, we can understand her words if we consider 
					three points
					1- she was adrenalized and emotional
					2- the situation was outside her 'normal.' (being an actress 
					she wasn't used to dealing with physically violent people.)
					3-verbal aggression was how she normally 'defended herself.' 
					(as is the case with most people.) 
in that light, through attitude and words alone 
					she was trying to end the situation and ensure her friends 
					and hers' safety. how do you normally chase away someone you 
					don't like? by showing attitude and challenging them. that 
					approach is especially common among city dwellers; often to 
					the point of reflex. 
except, these were not 'normal' circumstances. her 
					default conflict behavior got her killed facing a mugger– 
					because a mugging is not a conflict. it's a violent crime. 
					now in case you're thinking you're too smart to do that, 
					i'll bet you dollars to doughnuts ms dufresne thought so 
					too.
 something you need to know. there's     
					 
					part of your brain that will be screaming at you to be 
					the  most provoking, insulting and hurtful you can be 
					to the other person. this is especially true when you're 
					afraid or angry. (two of the most common emotions around 
					violence.) while that behavior often works in situations 
					where physical violence is off the table, it provokes 
					someone who is physically violent.
 sound complicated? well it is. as a therapist friend of 
					mine is fond of saying "humans are messy." we are complex 
					multi-layered, inconsistent, hypocritical, self-justifying, 
					often contradictory, emotional creatures. that really 
					applies to violence - - especially when it comes our own. 
					violence is very much a human behavior (we're biological 
					animals after all.) a lot of what we're conditioned to 
					believe about violence denies this, as well as our own 
					'wiring.' that often leaves you trapped between your biology 
					and social conditioning and the law. we're here to help you 
					get out of that trap. at the same time, the very fact that 
					you're human, is really going to help you understand and 
					navigate these complexities. you do this kind of stuff all 
					the time, we're just going to make you more aware of what 
					you already know about people. like i said, common sense.
 if you've ever taken any self-defense training was any 
					of this mentioned?
we'll tell you right now: self-defense is much more 
					than just physical. it's all that other stuff -- stuff 
					you won't get from just physical training -- that we cover 
					here. so like we said, even though the information is free, 
					the price you're going to have to pay is skullsweat and 
					time. if you know what you want to learn, go ahead and skip 
					there. if not, keep reading. 
 

						why is crime simpler than interpersonal violence?
						we mentioned earlier there are a lot of hollywood-fueled 
					misconceptions about crime and violence out there. what 
					hollywood doesn't show -- and you may not consciously know 
					-- is: most                                                                         
						
						violence 
						occurs between people who  know each other. 
when you think about it, this makes sense. those 
						around you are the ones you're most likely to come in 
						conflict with. when was the last time you had an 
						argument with a total stranger vs. when did you last 
						have an argument with someone you knew?                              
						this is what makes dealing with                              
						
						interpersonal violence   
						more complicated than just avoiding a crime. 
interpersonal violence 
						is    
						personal.
quite frankly, an outright crime is much 
						easier to   
						
						avoid. in fact, if you know what to    
						
						look for, crime is really easy to prevent. he's not 
						coming after you personally. since robbing you is just 
						as easy as robbing someone else, the criminal doesn't 
						care who he selects. the easier the target the better.
it is with interpersonal violence that things become 
						complex. that's because    
						
						criminal violence   
						has a recognizable and external goal. interpersonal 
						violence is filled with all kinds of internal and 
						subjective standards, goals and emotions. usually 
						what you are protecting, trying to achieve or fighting 
						over in such conflicts, isn't physical. 
and yet, conflicts can -- and often do -- escalate 
						into physical violence. 
such violence is                                
						usually 'personal.' not only from the standpoint of it 
						is directed at a particular person, but that it is often 
						a form of punishment. that person is seeking physical 
						revenge for the emotional hurt you caused him or her.
with this in mind, realize: what you   
						
						say and do has a huge effect on whether or 
						not you are physically assaulted. you do have 
						power and control over whether or not you are attacked. 
						teaching you how to exercise this power is what this 
						site is mostly about.
where things get really complicated is that there is 
						no one simplistic strategy that you can use in every 
						situation. what works to resolve a conflict with one 
						person will provoke another into attacking. you 
						may think what you're doing will scare him away, but 
						often you're actually pouring gasoline onto the fire. 
						knowing when to do what and when not to do that are 
						another reason why things get complicated. personal 
						safety is less 
						about punching and kicking and more about people 
						skills. 
large sections of this site are dedicated to looking 
						at the nature of conflict, including the difference 
						between   
						
						assertiveness and aggression, how we 
						behave under stress, the   
						
						psychology of conflict,   
						
						why violence occurs and   
						
						how not to provoke a physical assault. these are all 
						elements that will cause a conflict to escalate to 
						physical violence.    
						
what you say and do has a major influence on 
						finding yourself involved in violence. this fact does 
						not  magically disappear because you are 
						upset,    
						
						angry or    
						
						arguing. when you are   
						
						emotionally caught up in a conflict, it is easy to 
						not only provoke an attack from someone else, but it is 
						appalling easy for you
initiate the physical violence.
as unbelievable as it may sound, you can do this 
						without even realizing you did it until the person 
						counter attacks. even easier is to say something so 
						hurtful and insulting that the person flies into a rage 
						and attacks. over 2,000 years ago horace wrote "anger is 
						a short madness (insanity)." you can be so angry, 
						emotional or upset that you don't realize what you are 
						doing. but that doesn't mean you aren't doing it.
realize this is a two-way street, the same thing can 
						be happening with the person you are in conflict with. 
						but in fact,    
						
						violent people   
						are violent because they lack the self-control not to 
						act on these impulses. this lack can be circumstantial, 
						physiological, psychological or simply because the 
						person chooses to behave this way. while anyone can be 
						pushed too far, some people believe violence is a fast 
						and easy way to get what they want.
because so much violence arises from conflict, it 
						seriously complicates the subject of     
						
						self-defense. if you participated in the creation, 
						escalation and mutual physicality of the situation, that 
						really isn't    
						self-defense. 
most people call it fighting. in case you didn't know 
						it, while self-defense is legal, fighting isn't. 
you should also know this is why so many people are  
						supposedly arrested for'                          
						
						self-defense.' "go to prison for defending myself" 
						is a common wail. the truth is, most the time the 
						weren't

						defending themselves, they were actually                          
						
						fighting.
but when you are    
						
						emotional,   
						
						angry or    
						
						scared, everything you do seems like 
						self-defense. that big bad person was attacking you! 
						while that is your    
						
						perception, that isn't necessarily what was 
						happening. nor is is necessarily what you were doing. 
						your brain under    
						 
						extreme emotion and stress sees things differently 
						than when you are calm. and those perceptions can 
						lead you to chasing someone down the street slashing 
						them with a knife thinking what you are doing is 
						self-defense.   
						it isn't.
it is their inability to tell the difference -- 
						not unjust laws                               
						-- that gets most people into trouble. and in more ways 
						than one. it's also what causes a situation to go from 
						verbal                               
						
						violence to physical violence. this is also why we 
						give a layman's explanation of what self-defense is and 
						when what you're doing           
						
						stops being self-defense.
believe it or not, personal safety is less 
						about what you do than it is about what you don't 
						do -- especially in certain situations. 
the 'why you don't do that' is what makes both 
						the subject of    
						violence -- and this site -- so big and complex. 
						once you understand 'why certain behaviors will 
						lead to violence' you greatly lessen your chances of 
						unwittingly doing them. not only will this keep you from 
						being arrested for fighting or assault, but it greatly 
						reduces your chances of being raped, assaulted, beaten 
						or even killed.
there are no simple answers when it comes to 
						interpersonal violence. that is because you are a major 
						factor in whether it happens or not. your choices, your 
						behaviors and what you say, have major influence 
						on whether or not physical violence occurs. 
so you do have 
						control over whether violence happens to you -- or not. 
						
but it starts 
						with you controlling your emotions,    
						instead of your emotions controlling you. the 
						reason this is important is that the person who resorts 
						to physical violence the fastest is almost always being 
						driven there by his out of control emotions. if you 
						aren't willing to go faster and further down that road 
						than he is, then you will lose that race.
oh, by the way. this information 
						will also go miles for improving the quality of your 
						life, lessening conflict in your life and help you get 
						along with other people. this site isn't just about 
						
						self-defense, it's also about developing every day 
						people skills to make your life easier.
 

						new pages                                                 
						this site is huge and it keeps changing.

the next newest page is

after that is "     
            					
            					don't make it so your children are afraid to

								car were hit by a train. she lived, but she 
								isn't just paraplegic, she's nearly a steven 
								hawkings level of crippled. she didn't jump out 
								of the car. instead she stayed and tried to get 
								it started because she was afraid of what her 
								dad would say if something happened to the 
								car. i'm pretty certain the car was less 
								important to him than his daughter.)
want to know how to 
						tell you're about to be attacked?here we look at the 
						biggest     
						
						pre-attack indicator of them all. 
what are the behaviors that lead to violence? in this   
						
						martial secrets podcast, kris wilder interviews marc 
						macyoung about conflict communications and why violence 
						happens 
the huge difference between    
						 
	        				fear management and danger management. the 
						difference is one actually keeps you safe. the other not 
						only puts you in more danger, but makes you feel better 
						about it.
