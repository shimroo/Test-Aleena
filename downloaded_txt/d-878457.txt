welcome 

              to llano county, "land 

              of legend and lure," the "deer capitol of texas," 

              and the home of enchanted rock.
we are located in this beautiful 

              part of central texas hill country.  

              come see why we call this area the "heart of texas."
take time to relax and enjoy the 

              peace and tranquillity of this texas century ranch. gene hall is a sixth generation texan whose great great 

              grandfather, mathew moss, acquired land from the battle 

              of san jacinto and for being one of stephen 

              f. austin's colonists. the  brand he designed is 

              still in use on this 100 year old working cattle ranch.
stunning rugged granite outcroppings, 

              an abundance of wildflowers, oak trees, hills, and wildlife create 

              a paradise for artists, rock 

              hounds, birders, nature 

              lovers, star gazers, photographers, 

              hunters, and fishermen.
whether yearning for the peace 

              and relaxation of a quiet hideaway, or the excitement of 

              the hunt, your wishes will be rewarded at century ranch lodging. 

              until 1992 only cattle and deer hunting had supported this working 

              ranch. gene then made the decision to diversify and share this wonderful 

              place with others through guest lodging.
she offers you the choice of two wonderful 

              properties with roots deep in texas history and a charm that is 

              brand new.
for five generations, texans have 

              enjoyed the spectacular views, mild 

              weather and restorative powers of these oak-covered hills. now you 

              can live the legends of dutch mountain ranch and pecan creek ranch.

              shops, tea rooms, art gallery, wildlife museum, and history museum.
