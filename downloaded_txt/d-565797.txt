sharing god’s love for the highest possible purpose.
















our congregation is a multi-generational group that strives to grow spiritually, work together to serve others and create a welcoming space for all. we hope you’ll consider joining us on sunday mornings. we start at 9 am in classes, which are available for all age groups, before meeting all together 10-11 am to pray, sing, share communion, and learn together as a whole congregation. then everyone is welcome to join one of our small groups for prayer and discussion 11-11:40 am. these small group experiences give us an opportunity to support and encourage each other in our journeys with god.
