the best lawyers in town!!! david robbins was very attentive and was always available to answer any and all my questions!!! he gave me his personal cell number to call! amazing!! also, i never had to step foot in a courtroom, had a team of three lawyers on my case, and happy to yell from the rooftops “i did not get charged with a felony!!!” they really made sure i was at peace of mind throughout the entire trial!! so thankful for them! would recommend them a million times over!- tina k.

i was referred to epstein & robbin’s by a friend. by retaining mr. robbin’s during this most difficult time in my life, mr. robbin’s and derek maines made positive influences in my life. i was being criminally investigated for two serious felony charges as well as misdemeanor charges. charges that can ruin not only a reputation, but a life. i found mr. robbin’s to be a compassionate attorney who speaks from his heart but does not varnish the truth. mr. robbins and mr. maines devised a strategy to address all charges. after some meticulous work, and working with the da, all charges were either dropped or significantly reduced. i was left with two misdemeanor charges and no convictions. i now have my life back. if you’re reading this and facing a difficult time in your own life, this firm has earned a most fervent and enthusiastic recommendation from me. you can feel confident with the services of mr. robbin’s and his firm. thank you mr. robbins and mr. maines.- george n.

i could not have been more pleased with the service i received from epstein & robbins. after 6 months of inadequate representation, and related frustration, from another firm, i decided it was time to move on. my very first meeting with e&r was enough to convince me i had made the right move.my first meeting included david robbins (managing partner) who, after hearing the details of my case, accepted me as a client, assuring me e&r would provide professional and competent representation.based on my experience with the previous firm, i had become incredibly stressed about my situation. however, david’s calm demeanor and insightful assessment allowed me to walk out with a peace of mind i had not felt in over 6 months.the attorney that actually handled my case, derek maines, could not have been more effective. he listened attentively as we discussed my case, which was such a departure form the “sit in the corner and shut up” attitude of the previous firm. throughout the process, derek was in constant communication with me and never left me wondering about the status of my case.but, most importantly, he recognized there were unique aspects of my dui, which he then incorporated into a convincing and persuasive argument, enabling him to, first, negotiate a reduced sentence; then, from there, get the case resolved … with no conviction.the final resolution and lack of conviction was well beyond what i had hoped for. do i recommend epstein & robbins?? i believe so!!- larry l.

overall it was great! i got dui charge and blew a .2 and never had to show up to court except the day after arrest which is great bc it would have caused anxiety going to those sessions! andrew was able to review the footage and found out some evidence wasn't obtained lawfully and was able to get it suppressed which helped charge get dropped! even without the dropping of it im confident they would have gotten it dropped to reckless driving due to them constantly working behind the scenes with state prosecutorssusan was great with the suggestions on next steps and allison was great at keeping me posted- jason s.
