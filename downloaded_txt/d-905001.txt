the paddington substation is home to hands on art. dedicated to being a supportive space for arts activities and workers. it is a perfect space for any creative activity; including art and photographic exhibitions, workshops, training and more. hands on art is committed to sharing the space with groups and creative activities which fit within the hands on art mission.
renovation works have included the addition of a lift and all abilities bathroom, increasing accessibility and allowing even more people to enjoy not only the beautifully restored building but also the programs and activities conducted inside. it has also become a fantastic community space to exhibit arts and crafts.
