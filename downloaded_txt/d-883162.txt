i was helped in so many ways. you know, i couldn’t be more grateful and blessed, you know, to have the staff here at stvt – the students that i was with and my instructors.  it couldn’t have been any better.


richard victor mendez, jr.
stvt san antonio, combination welding graduate














i heard about stvt with commercials when i was just sitting down one night. i heard a commercial about it – saw that they offered the dental assisting program – saw that it was just a few months instead of, you know, years and that’s something that really did interest me.
