quality design and superior construction




1.5 inch electric tape with 10 wires in 30% thicker stainless steel, 31 polyethylene uv resistant yarns, and stout bumpers at the tape edges, making it a stiffer tape (not flimsy like other bad brands) to increase effectiveness and protect against wear.   
design reduces arcing caused by contact with vegetation.  
the sturdy open weave greatly reduces movement in high winds, reducing friction at the post attachments and prolonging the life of the tape. 
all metal parts are of stainless steel to strengthen the fencing system and prevent the rust that reduces connectivity. 
special, flexible plastic was developed to overcome global weather challenges
