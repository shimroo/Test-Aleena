                        why is there actually something and not
                      just nothing?

why is there
                    something and not just nothing? this question is the
                    oldest and most fundamental question that has ever
                    existed. to answer this question, you have to start
                    from the very beginning. the very beginning is where
                    the question no longer arises: "what was there
                    before?" absolutely nothing is the only term that no
                    longer raises the question: "what was there before?"
                    absolutely nothing has never existed, because if
                    there had ever been absolutely nothing, it would
                    have always stayed that way. because in absolute
                    nothingness there would of course have been no
                    possibility that this state would ever change,
                    because even the slightest possibility would have
                    been more than absolutely nothing. something has
                    therefore always been there, because if this
                    something had come into being, there would have been
                    absolutely (without exception) nothing before its
                    creation and it would have always stayed that way.

 

 .
however, why hasn't there been nothing without
                  exception and why did it not remain so?
well, where would there
                have been nothing without exception then? nothing
                without exception (any absence of anything) allows for
                no dimension in which it could have existed or, relative
                to which, everything could have been absent, as a
                dimension would already be more than nothing. and when
                would nothing without exception have been? nothing
                without exception also allows for no time in which it
                could have existed or, relative to which, everything
                could have been absent, as time would also already be
                more than nothing. absolutely nothing theoretically
                could never have been, as even a theory would already be
                more than nothing. the state of "nothing without
                exception" (an absence of all that exists) could
                therefore never have been. for even an absence would
                also already be more than nothing, since an absence
                requires something relative to which it can be absent. 
  
 
 
what then could have been
                      absent relative to what, and when and where? 
                    
this is a
                    catch-22.
 
 

                   something has always been there. because
                only something present (1) also creates the possibility
                for absence (0) to be absent relative to something.
                somewhat comparable to numbers in mathematics. if there
                would be no numbers, there would be no zeros. without
                one, there wouldn't even be zero. without something,
                there wouldnât even be nothing.

something
                and nothing

    

   something: a
                  singular, purposeless, sense-free, real being. 
this something has always
                existed because, in timelessness, the moment is
                simultaneously an eternity. this something is the
                totality of all being. however, it cannot refer to
                anything. without a reference point, this something is
                both there and not there. it fluctuates in rhythm
                without an arrow of time. this causes a âmistakeâ in
                nothing and thereby also enables the real existence of
                the nothing in the form of infinite theoretical
                possibilities that can be realised by the something. the
                nothing only exists in conjunction with the something.
                without something, there wouldn't even be nothing.

                   nothing = infinite theoretical
                neutral possibilities. one of the infinite number of
                  theoretical possibilities actually exists in
                practice, namely a something. if this something did not
                exist, no further possibility could be realised because
                only a real possibility can also realise theoretical
                possibilities. this is somewhat comparable to the many
                possibilities in a football match. without something (a
                ball), there would be no theoretical possibilities for
                playing football. without a ball, there wouldn't be
                football, just as without something there wouldn't even
                be nothing. if i were alone in nothing, i could stretch
                my hand into nothing, because nothing gives me the
                opportunity to do so. this means: nothing = theoretical
                possibilities.



                 something +
                  nothing,




 therefore, are the lowest common
                denominator. anything smaller would be less than
                nothing. hence, the lowest common denominator at the
                same time also includes everything. and that is exactly
                what we observe. in the micro, meso, and macrocosm, we
                observe a mixture of something and nothing. it cannot be
                any other way, for something without nothing would be
                infinitely large and dense, with no possibility of this
                state ever changing. and nothing without something would
                never even be nothing. but
                both are not flawless!




the
                  imperfection
 
 

    the





















































































































                  imperfection (the flawedness):  something causes a flaw in nothing,
                thereby establishing the foundation of the basic
                principle, the imperfection (the flawedness). 
                the something itself cannot escape the principle it has
                caused and is therefore also imperfect (flawed).
                nothing, as an exception, contains something within it,
                and something, as an exception, contains nothing within
                it. both cause a flaw in the other, as also somewhat
                symbolised in the yin-yang concept. whatever is
                subsequently developed, formed and shaped from this
                causally imperfect something + nothing will remain
                imperfect, as both are already imperfect in the lowest
                common denominator. this is somewhat (symbolically)
                comparable to the fundamental principle of lego, the
                studs. whatever you build with lego bricks contains
                studs (exceptions to the rule). you can build in a way
                that hides the studs, but they are there. without studs,
                lego wouldn't be lego. just as nothing without something
                would not be nothing.    
                    imperfection is the basic principle
                of all being. this is how it is and always will be. from
                the smallest to the largest, everything is and remains
                flawed.



  by flawed, we
                      donât mean wrong or defective but rather an
                      exception to the rule, 
                      an irregularity within regularity, an asymmetry
                      within symmetry,  a deviation from the
                      conventional, 
                      a fluctuation in vibration, an uncertainty within
                      that which is certain, 
                      an inaccuracy or fuzziness, something that is
                      missing within the fullness, 
                      or succinctly put: an imperfection in perfection!



 
  

 imperfection is the fundamental
                        principle of all that is!

                                however, even not being able to be would
                                already be more than nothing, because
                                not being able to be requires anything
                                relative to which it cannot be. this is

                                to exist. for only the presence of a
                                something allows the nothing to be
                                absent relative to anything.

i am the almighty:   
the imperfection

                  nothing can bend me, not even i myself!



  
                  imperfection (flawedness) is the most fundamental of
                  all natural laws. it is empirically demonstrable at
                  any time and place, ad infinitum. no observation
                  proves otherwise. does anyone know anything absolute?
                  imperfection was already omnipotent in the primordial
                  and is above all natural laws, even above our lives.
                  its omnipotence forces disorder into our daily lives
                  time and again. that is to say: the more we organise
                  our lives, the more disorder forces itself into the
                  order, so that the order remains imperfect. for this,
                  there is no cure. 

 


 
                


the tragedy of perfectionism
 

 

  simplified symbolism:  

you dig a hole in a snowy field and use the
                snow to build a snowman. the snowman is happy to be
                finding himself in a snowy field without any flaws.
                however, he then sees the hole. to create a perfect
                world for himself, he begins to repair the hole. since
                the snowman himself is the material he needs to repair
                the flaw in the snowy field, he starts destroying
                himself.




  
  
 

the drive for
                        perfection brought suffering into his world!

 

  
  
cause and
                effect 
 
.
 
the subsequent
                  course is then only a symptom
.
                    .

 
  
                before the snowman has destroyed himself, he will dig
                several holes and build small snowmen to preserve his
                kind. when these snowmen grow up, they are happy that
                they are standing in a perfect snowy field, but then
                they see their holes. to create a perfect world for
                themselves, they begin to repair the holes. since the
                snowmen themselves are the material they need to repair
                the damage in the snowy field, they start destroying
                themselves. not all snowmen will destroy themselves.
                some will attack other snowmen to obtain the snow they
                need to improve their world. they will organise
                themselves, defend themselves, arm themselves and, as a
                last resort, go to war. many snowmen will die because of
                this and they will establish religions and sanctify war
                in order to justify the fallen in the name of god. 
                this sequence of events throws the entire snowy field
                into chaos (with one exception). all because the first
                snowman wanted the snowy field to be the way it would be
                if he wasn't there, and as a result the constant desire
                for improvement became the meaning of his life.


he could have shaped
                        the entire snowy field as he wished. 
                        however, he also wanted it to be perfect!

.
the drive for perfection
                  brought suffering into his world!

                     it takes a long time, for the
                  first snowman to realise that nothing can be without
                  flaws. 
                  the decrease in the order of the snowy field is
                  contrary to the increase in the snowmanâs
                  consciousness of order. the more the chaos in the
                  snowy field increases, the more the snowman realises
                  that he cannot fix the original flaw. this behaviour
                  runs like a common thread through all areas of our
                  lives.     

                    the story of the snowman is universally
                  symbolic and can be applied to anything: politics,
                  economics, science, education, finance, legislation,
                  technology, medicine, healthcare, food,
                  administration, bureaucracy, upbringing, sport, media,
                  tradition, religion, world views and even the whole of
                  civilisation. if civilisation oversteps its bounds,
                  nature reclaims its natural order.  - when
                  applying this story to oneself, one understands their
                  own imperfection. all attempts to prevent self-induced
                  flaws remain ineffective. chance places its own flaws
                  haphazardly, as it was the same in the primordial. the
                  something is also randomly placed in the nothing
                  because of non-existent placement criteria without any
                  possibility of being placed in the wrong place. due to
                  this causality, chance has no possibility of causing
                  something wrong for all time. chance can do anything,
                  with one exception: he can't let anything wrong happen.

 
    the tragedy of
                    perfectionism: health


  
                    once upon a time, there were two people. let's
                  just call them "adam and eve" for fun. they were
                  healthy, with one exception: once a month (arbitrarily
                  assumed time frame) they got a pimple on their face
                  (symbolic illness), that disappeared again on its own.
                  one day, they thought: it is not good that there is an
                  exception to our health once a month and that we fall
                  ill. we no longer want to make this sacrifice. we will
                  build up our own perfect health. they successfully
                  used a medicinal herb against the pimple, resulting in
                  the next generation getting a pimple twice a month:
                  the system-induced pimple + the inherited pimple from
                  the previous generation. the sum remains constant, but
                  shifted in time! the next generation then used even
                  more medicinal herbs, etc. and this "original sin"
                  multiplied over time resulting in our present-day
                  ailments and diseases with all its countermeasures.
                  this process continues in waves until one no longer
                  treats the small, trivial illnesses (the exceptions)
                  but endures them. then the process reverses, slowly
                  but inevitably. due to its ineffectiveness, homeopathy
                  is the best medicine against small, banal illnesses
                  (the exceptions).

                    imperfection is always at least one
                  exception ahead of us. comparable to a pressure relief
                  valve on a boiler. if one considers the loss of hot
                  water dripping out of the valve as a defect instead of
                  recognising it as a characteristic of the principle
                  and one fixes this "flaw" by sealing the valve, this
                  "flaw" multiplies in other places. and this is exactly
                  how diseases develop. diseases are not caused by
                  ghosts and magic but by a failure to observe the most
                  fundamental of all natural laws, imperfection. it is
                  the treatment of the small, trivial, recurring
                  diseases (the exceptions) that exponentially multiply
                  exceptions with ever new exceptions and their
                  countermeasures. that's why wild animals - who are
                  without doctors, hospitals, and the pharmaceutical
                  industry - are generally much healthier than we
                  humans. this can be observed everywhere. exceptions
                  confirm the rule.
                      disability:  disabled people are
                  the exceptions to the intact. both physical and
                  mental. exceptions are the foundation of everything
                  that exists. if there were no disabled people, there
                  would be no unscathed people either. honor the
                  disabled. your disability carries us integrety.

the
                    principle of life 
  
 

that there is not
                  nothing is undisputed, for otherwise we would not be
                  here.
.
 
    we are here, that cannot
                  be denied. yes, but why are we here anyway?
                      
                we (this something) are the exception in the nothing. we
                are here because it is not possible 
                to not be here. if we were not here, then even nothing
                wouldn't be here.
.
                   but why are we alive?   
                     
                life is the exception (the flaw)  in
                the lifeless. the meaning of life is to live. because
                without life there is no lifelessness, without
                lifelessness there is no something and without something
                there would not even be nothing. however, to bridge
                eternity, everyone should give deep meaning to each life
                because eternity then lasts a bit longer after all. so
                bad luck. because recurring chance encounters with
                oneself bring every injustice back into balance. approximate symmetry is a property on
                very large scales. and
                suddenly the lost truth from days long past knocks at
                the door. somehow, somewhere, sometime. 
.
                    and where do we come from?  






































































































































                  
                we have always been here, because without us, not even
                nothing would have been here.      
.
                   and what are we doing here?  
                  
                we do nothing other than just being here because without
                us here, there wouldn't even be nothing.
.
                   and where are we going afterwards?
                    
                we will always be here, because if we were no longer
                here, not even nothing would be left. 
                about 3.5 billion years ago, life merged with the
                lifeless to form the first cell (chance). 1.5 billion
                years later, evolution brought death into life. dying is
                not a part of life, but a primitive apparition of
                evolution in which matter separates from the information
                of our life. and this cannot be irrevocably lost; where
                would it even go? information cannot dissolve into
                absolutely nothing, because absolutely nothing does not
                exist (see page 1); there is only relatively nothing
                (relative to something) and these are possibilities (see
                page 2). died and resting in peace as a timeless
                information of a possibility waiting for a new
                coincidence.
.
                   but who are we (this something in
                  nothing) really?     
                this question remains unanswered. self-awareness also
                remains forever imperfect. 

   imperfection
                is the fundamental principle of all that is. the
                totality as an exception to this rule. only as a âbig
                wholeâ is all existence absolute. if the details were
                not flawed, the whole could not be perfect. such is the
                principle. the more holistically you perfect it, the
                more primitive flaws chance introduces in the details so
                that the whole can remain perfect. only through our
                imperfections in the details are we perfect. - that is
                why causality is also imperfect. the something is both
                there and not there due to the lack of a reference
                point. it fluctuates (pulses) perfectly in time with one
                exception (flaw). therefore, causes are not followed by
                absolute effects. and even with what is called the "big
                bang," it was no different.  one fluctuation
                happened to be out of step (flaw).  the something
                was already back, even though it hadn't completely gone
                away. the something meets itself, just like the sperm
                meets the egg for life to begin. the same principle as
                with fertilisation. the "big bang" was by chance because
                chances are exceptions in causality.  - but chance
                is also not flawless.  the imperfection of chance
                grants life free will. from the point of view of
                causality, free will is consciously induced coincidences
                and thus flawed coincidences. the less we fix what
                happens by chance (both the good and the bad), the freer
                our will is. simply not fixing chance brings freedom
                into our lives. 



the more we live
                          with chance, the freer our life becomes.

the motionless mover





              
             







































































































































                              

 the
                                principle of relativity
.
every uniform and
                              straight-line motion is relative
                              and can only refer to one reference point!

 
 (galileo galilei)
 






the something can neither refer to
                  a beginning nor an end, 
                  because it has always been there and will always
                  continue to exist.
the something
                      has no reference point.

one would not
                  actually be able to determine a property of this
                  something 
                  were it not for the principle of relativity, which
                  states: 
motion can only
                      refer to a reference point!

since the
                  something cannot refer to anything, it cannot move, 
                  since it would only be able to move relative to a
                  reference point. 
                  so let's establish a property:
the something is
                      motionless!

on the other
                  hand, this something cannot simply be motionless just
                  like that 
                  because it could only be motionless relative to a
                  reference point. 
                  so letâs establish another property:
the something is
                      in motion!

without a reference point, the
                  something is both âin motion" 
                  and "motionlessâ at the same time.

 
the missing reference point = the
                        motionless mover


the question of how
                  the missing reference point originated does not arise,
                  
                  because in order to be missing, you need not have
                  originated. 
                  one only needs something relative to which one is
                  missing.


                       the primal size: since the something without a reference
                point cannot have a fixed size either, (a specific size
                can also only exist relative to a reference size, e.g. a
                scale), it is both small and large at the same time.

   the time: the same applies to time. without a
                temporal reference point (e.g. a clock), it is not
                possible to assign the something to a specific time.
                that is, the something exists in every moment as well as
                for all eternity because in timelessness (time without
                an arrow of time) the moment is timed for eternity.


the something
                        (everything that is) is both there 
                      and not there (timed without an arrow of time).
without an arrow of time, the moment is
                      simultaneously also eternity. 
the something pulsates in a rhythm from small
                      to large and vice versa (space).
it moves within itself in its motionlessness
                        (energy or mass as a possibility).
the endless balancing of the
                    difference in motion between movement and rest does
                    the work.


   the
                something is almost nothing, but not quite nothing. it
                is almost infinitely small but not zero and it is almost
                infinitely large. it moves periodically from small to
                large relative to itself due to the absence of a
                reference point, as it can also only rest relative to
                itself when there is no reference point. we can perceive
                this as a heartbeat. the fluctuating something
                (everything that is) also causes our hearts to beat.
                    


   nothing says to
                        something:  "as my heartbeat, you have
                        always belonged to me"

religion


  
                      even in ancient times, people felt that they were
                      surrounded by an omnipotence. due to ignorance of
                      its causality, they interpreted this omnipotence
                      into various gods. we come into this world and
                      religions are already here. that is why we think
                      religion belongs to this world.





                      only i alone am the omnipotence:
the imperfection
(the faultiness)
                     


i am the only "god" (if one
                      uses the term "god.")
                      there is no other god besides me! 

                    i am eternal, omnipresent and almighty.

                    as long as you do not, like me, acknowledge and
                    accept 
                    your individual imperfections, you cannot be my
                    image!
                    as long as you are not my image, i will let you die.
i am an uncompromising god!

                    if you all become my image together, you will stay
                    alive with me.
i am an eternal god!

                    as my image, i leave you the fruits of our creation.
i am a selfless god!

   





                      i only claim the imperfection caused by chance, i
                      need nothing more. self-made sacrifices, rituals
                      and ceremonies are ineffective. i also disregard
                      any kind of veneration, glorification or worship.
                      i am just a structure, a pattern, a system, a
                      principle! you can't do me any service. exception:
                      preserving your individual imperfections is the
                      only service you can do me, because only in this
                      way are we one. 
                      -  so that you become my image, i will
                      destroy your false gods and bring everything
                      hidden behind them to light. with salvation, it is
                      not the case that a clown comes along and says:
                      âtri-tra-trallala, salvation is here!â




good and evil

                        the faulty structure is good, the urge for
                        perfection is evil!
                    we are good with our mistakes, but fixing them is
                    evil!


  
                      evil multiplies when we not only do not want our
                      mistakes in ourselves, but we also interpret them
                      in others and fight them there.   
                    
    

  
                        genesis: you may eat of all fruits, but you
                      may not eat anything from the tree in the middle
                      (exception), otherwise you will die, because these
                      fruits are you yourself.   
                           

   related to the
                        snowman: you can design the whole snowfield,
                      but leave this one mistake (the snow hole) in the
                      middle of the snowfield (exception) untouched,
                      otherwise you will die, because this mistake is
                      you yourself. if you fix this mistake, you fix
                      yourself.

the principle of
                  chance


   the
                  something is randomly placed in nothing. nothing is
                  more relevant to our daily lives than this
                  circumstance. here is a story that contains errors,
                  which i will also point out. however, we will ignore
                  these errors for the sake of clarity.

   a farmer has an
                  infinitely large farm. every m2 of his infinitely
                  large arable land is the same as all the other square
                  meters. he therefore has an infinite number of
                  theoretical, equal possibilities that he can use
                  according to his own possibilities, depending on what equipment he has
                  available for his farming. the farmer has a seed that
                  he wants to plant. the farmer is faced with an
                  infinite number of theoretical possibilities. this is
                  of course wrong, because if his theoretical
                  possibilities are infinite, he is already within the
                  possibilities. however, we will ignore this. he looks
                  for a place where he will plant his seed. where does
                  he plant his seed? in the absence of decision criteria
                  (every m2 of his arable land is the same as all the
                  others), he lets chance decide. that is also wrong,
                  because there is no such thing as chance as such, only
                  chance. we ignore that too. he plants his seed in the
                  place chosen by chance (randomness). - could it be
                  that in hindsight it turns out that chance was not
                  very clever? could it be that it would have been
                  better if chance had chosen a different place on his
                  field? no, of course not. that is completely out of
                  the question. wherever he planted his seed would have
                  made no difference. chance did nothing wrong, because every possibility is equal to
                  all other possibilities. not only did chance do
                  nothing wrong, it did not even have a chance of doing
                  anything wrong.



after



















                      the big bang, nothing is as it was before, with
                      two exceptions:


   exception 1)
                  the imperfection caused by the error in nothing, which
                  was already there before the big bang, remains after
                  the big bang. everything remains imperfect.

   exception 2)
                  the something is placed in nothing by chance. before
                  the big bang, chance not only did nothing wrong, but
                  it did not even have a chance to do anything wrong.
                  chance had no chance of placing something in the wrong
                  place in nothingness, because all possibilities are
                  equal. this situation remains the same after the big
                  bang. all coincidences have no chance of being wrong.

   whatever happens by
                  chance, leave it as it is, for chance cannot make
                  anything wrong, even if it seems wrong at the moment.
                  for chance (randomness) watches over the way in which
                  imperfection remains imperfect.

   the something is
                  almost infinitely small relative to nothingness (the
                  infinite number of theoretical possibilities). this
                  means that the smaller the unrepaired damage that
                  chance has done to you, the greater the compensation
                  will be. somehow, somewhere, sometime, chance becomes
                  fate. just like in the example with health on page 5.
                  the reverse is the same. if chance causes you great
                  harm relative to your circumstances, you should remedy
                  it, because fate will only compensate you to a very
                  small extent.  -  warning: trying to
                  help chance in the slightest is ineffective, because
                  the executor of imperfection cannot be outsmarted.

                     the philosophy behind physics
.
                  without something, there wouldn't even be nothing!


   and if one
                  wants to be really precise: relativity itself is this
                  something that fluctuates because without a reference
                  point, the relative is both existent and non-existent
                  (timed). both relative (in detail) and absolute (as a
                  whole). but not without exception. for the relative
                  causes a flaw in the theoretically absolute nothing
                  and therefore cannot escape its self-caused principle
                  and is therefore also flawed. if relativity is there,
                  then it is not perfectly there, because an exception
                  is not there. if it is not there, then it is not
                  perfectly not there, because an exception is there.
                  what we call the big bang was a random fluctuation
                  (exception) in the vibration of relativity. an
                  asymmetry (flaw) in the symmetry that gives direction
                  to timelessness (rhythm without an arrow of time). the
                  beginning of time. from now on, everything is only
                  approximately as it was before. no two moments are
                  exactly alike.

   relativity is this
                  unintentional, meaningless, real existing something
                  that fluctuates, which is why we too are only relative
                  to all others. that is why no two people are the same.
                  each person differs from all others by at least one
                  exception. no two exceptions are the same, so all
                  people are perfect only with their individual
                  shortcomings. everyone is relative to one another! -
                  the question of why relativity is the way it is and
                  not arbitrarily different remains unanswered.
                  imperfection does not provide a final answer. - can we
                  live without having a final answer?


     






































































































































                            long story short: 
.
                        a something causes a flaw in the nothing.
                      if that weren't the case, there wouldn't even be
                      nothing. flawedness (imperfection) is therefore
                      the most fundamental of all natural laws. the
                      something itself cannot escape the principle it
                      has caused and is therefore also flawed
                      (imperfect). and this imperfect something
                      (simultaneously everything) has also produced
                      itself as all of us (biological evolution) in
                      order to be able to observe itself, to question
                      itself, to think about itself, to recognize
                      itself, to see itself, and also to feel and
                      understand itself. therefore, we too are imperfect
                      (faulty) in all our actions, insights, thoughts
                      and feelings. and only in our self-knowledge
                      (knowledge of itself) does the something (the
                      everything) recognize itself.
. 
                         can we live with our imperfections?
                      we not only can, we must. because the more we
                      repair our natural shortcomings, the more they
                      multiply. don't allow others to speak ill of your
                      shortcomings. they are system-relevant and make
                      you unique. in reality, they only interpret their
                      own shortcomings into you and fight against them
                      in you instead of accepting them as a fundamental
                      principle within themselves. the snowman on page 4
                      can also testify to this: if one interprets their
                      own inadequacy, system-conditioned by the
                      fundamental principle of imperfection (symbolised
                      by the hole in the snowy field), into others to
                      fight against it there, others rightly resist. and
                      sometimes all those involved intensify the
                      confrontation to the point of waging war as a
                      final consequence.
.
                        final word: pay attention to
                      coincidence. he is the guardian of imperfection.
