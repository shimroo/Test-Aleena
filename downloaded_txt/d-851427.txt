a connected way of learning
 







we aim to give our students the tools they need to enjoy learning and thrive academically. our instructors guide their students through work that is set at just the right level for them, keeping them engaged and making progress. by studying little and often through daily worksheets and regular class sessions (online and/or in centre), our students steadily increase ability and fluency, building their skills in small, manageable steps. you can choose either the traditional paper and pencil format or digital, with kumon connect on your own tablet and stylus.
incorporating technology into our tried and tested materials enables us to provide even more support to your child, so while they develop the skills to study independently, their instructor will be at their side between classes, offering individual guidance, marking, and carefully adjusting their individual study plan as they progress.

											kumon challenges me and helps me progress.										










											from my perspective zac has excelled at school as a result of kumon. his confidence has been boosted among his peer group which has resulted in him being far happier.										










											zac has developed excellent study skills, mainly resilience and independence after three years of doing kumon maths and is always ready to tackle more difficult topics. i'm always so pleased to hear about his successes in school too.
