"
                    when you are hungry"




			click here or on the photo an old
16 mm movie
            that extols the benefits 
 of having planters peanuts
            around 
            to give you energy to work and play.
            mr. peanut uses some 1930's 
 movie technology to tell the story, 
            regrettably there is no sound.
