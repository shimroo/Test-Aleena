about tnr
tnr (trap / neuter / return) is the humane method used to reduce the population of feral cats. feral cats are humanely trapped, taken to a veterinarian for spay / neuter surgery, vaccination, ear-tipping and micro-chipping and then returned to the place where they were trapped to live safer, healthier lives with assistance from the caretaker who tnr’d them.
















“thanks to triple r pets, my cats are living a healthier, happier life.  i love the fall shelter building workshop every year.  i refresh my outdoor shelter, meet fellow caretakers and learn some new tips and tricks.” 














19years in the communitytriple r pets has been assisting animals and the people who love them for fifteen years.  from our humble roots on the gulf coast in mississippi following hurricane katrina to our disaster on the home front early tnr programs in chicago we have been actively working to better the lives of pets and their people since 2005.

 

1,200+colonies assistedthrough tnr efforts in illinois*, we have registered over 1,000 colonies in our tnr programs.  these caretakers are provided guidance in the best practices of caring for colony cats along with support in providing tnr services for their cats.* triple r pets provides limited support in northwest indiana as well

  

10,000+cats in our program with over 8,000 cats registered through triple r pets, we are cook county’s largest all-volunteer tnr organization.  serving the south and southwest area of chicago and the surrounding suburbs, the program continues to grow and support the community.
