what clients say


















"the efforts of the usfalcon tanker team were critical to the success of the 2018 kc-46 schedule risk assessment.  the government team was recognized as the tanker directorate team of the quarter. this year's sra results were briefed to the secretary of the air force as well as to congressional committees.  there was no room for errors and usfalcon nailed it!"

"you stepped to the plate and delivered even when the event shifted sideways a bit, you steered thru the rough waters and we delivered early and effectively.  your subcontractor also delivered as expected in support of the forward team at eustis.  it was a team effort every step of the way.   your team had their game face on and positive attitude the entire time i was there, and throughout the entire event.  it didnât go unnoticed.  thank you for all you do for the program.  i hope you are as proud of our successes as much as i am."
