thai economy slips on exit of unc exchange students.





while the thai economy is well diversified and capable of withstanding even severe market adjustments, the exit of several unc exchange students has caused unexpected turbulence to its stability. fortunately, this disturbance seems limited to certain “entertainment” sectors of the economy. however, the overall impact still managed to cause a 15% drop in the thai gdp.the thai ambassador is now frantically working with patricia collins to find suitable replacements to the missing kfbs students.  at present, he is holding out all hope for something he knows only vaguely as "mod 3". the onyen recommends that you have your exchange applications turned in as soon as possible so this problem can be addressed immediately and stability can be reestablished in the thai economy.

serageldin seeks reelection, will not ‘go quietly into the night’





former mbasa president ramy serageldin (pronounced serageldin) has requested a recount in the recent election that placed john chapman as his successor.  citing ‘unfairness’ in mbasa’s unwillingness to allow a two-term president, serageldin has called into question the fact that 1st years were not at least given the opportunity to vote for him.  “i’ve spent a full year trying to lay a solid foundation with these 1st years to make a 2nd term possible.  i mean, you’ve seen me out there.  when i work a room of 1st years, it’s a thing of beauty … ali didn’t float around prettier than i do around these young chumps.”  serageldin continued, “i’m virile, established and you all know that they want me back in the driver’s seat.”mba program director, michael stepanek, requested that serageldin ‘move on’ and ‘just get a job like the other 1/3 of his classmates’ who have found gainful employment.  speaking with some of serageldin’s classmates revealed the following, “ramy has really gotten drunk on power this past year. it would be frighteningly disgusting if it weren’t so sad.”  others indicated, “i think this latest rampage is primarily being fueled by late night jaeger bombs.”  serageldin countered, “these people are under the impression that employment in a city hundred of miles outside of chapel hill will keep me out of office next year.  what foolish, foolish souls. they don’t know what lengths i will go to get back to playing video games 80% of my day and pointing out attractive undergrads to my friends the rest of the day.”

bylinksi: "lang...  i am your father"





in a move that is sure to shock all kenan-flagler students, joe bylinski recently informed mark lang about his true biological history.   bylinski confesses, “that’s why i’m always harping on him class.  because i care so much about him and i’m so proud of him.” students have recognized the resemblance for years, but bylinski has previously denied the connection.  even though it's well known bylinski spread his seed like peanut butter back in the 60's.  “come on, guys. you gotta know i’ve always had a vested interest in mark.  i pulled strings for him at chicago gsb. i made sure he was placed well at stanford.  and then i convinced the dean to recruit him to carolina. i wanted to be close to my son,” says bylinski.lang vehemently denies that the two are related, “this is just another one of joey b’s shticks.” meanwhile, bylinski, who claims to have dna proof of the connection, is optimistic about a family reunion in the very near future, “i’m at a place in my life where i want to be honest with those who matter the most.   that reminds me, i've got some important news for john chapman”.

mccoll building to undergo yearly pastel renovation: color scheme will feature pink walls and ansel adams photos





mba administration recently announced that the business school’s new interior design will actually be a yearly rotation of pastels and different art styles.  this year’s canary yellow and impressionistic art will transition into pink walls with black and white ansel adams art for the 2008 school year.  the new furniture in the halls will also be transitioned on a yearly basis. next year’s furniture will have a more modern look. the renovations are estimated to cost the school more than 20 students tuition worth per year.dean jones fully supports the renovation expenses, but is concerned about the influx of pastel coloring into the building. a recent study of the entire business school population revealed that 83% of all undergraduates who attend classes in mccoll wear some version of a pastel-colored polo on a daily basis. jones is considering banning pastel polos until further notice. “i just think it gets to be too much.  i came into school the other day and all i saw were bright pinks and yellows.  something definitely needs to be done about that.  however, i think this sends a strong signal to our students about the importance of embracing change. this will help them understand that change is good – especially when you’re dealing with pastels.”

1st submission in the always ongoing "dook sucks competition"





fuqua announces schedule for orientation 2007on behalf of the fuqua mba program, we officially want to welcome you to dook! our orientation program is designed to get you acquainted to life in picturesque durham and introduce you to the rest of your classmates. we invite you to attend the following presentations and workshops, designed by our own staff to make your transition as quick and easy as possible. the schedule includes:dealing with failure: most incoming fuqua students arrive facing the disappointment of having been rejected by all of the ivy league business schools. it’s okay to be bitter about this - at fuqua, it’s completely normal. in this seminar, we tackle these feelings of rejection, as well as the painful process of telling your father you won’t be attending his alma mater. important topics covered will be: denial of failure, pretending to be happy, and convincing yourself and others that duke is “just like the harvard of the south.”superiority for dummies: you have officially been accepted to dook. from now on, you will have a lifelong duty to look down upon graduates of any other business program. although the admissions department chose you after recognizing signs of arrogance and perceived superiority, we hope to complete your transition into a flaming asshole as soon as possible. we will cover such topics as convincing yourself that you’re smarter than everyone else in the room, explaining away repeated case competition defeats, how best to show off your napoleon complex and, most importantly, mentioning dook within the first five minutes every time you meet someone.the enemy within: unlike most other schools, we encourage you to treat your fellow classmates as nothing more than roadblocks between you and your dream job back in new york. in order to succeed at fuqua, you will need to be willing to trample over your friends and family for your own personal gain. we will give you useful tips, including: how to make others look bad in front of recruiters, sabotaging classmates’ projects and making sure your roommate has explosive diarrhea on the morning of 2nd round interviews.from average to blah: we believe that having a personality can only get you in trouble in the long-run. in order to assimilate into our culture here at fuqua, we ask you to leave all individualism at the door. while this may have a negative effect on the prior relationships you’ve developed over the years, we urge you to leave them all behind and join us. you’re now among like-minded individuals whose only goal is to get the best available i-banking job after graduation. start working on being boring now. you’ll thank us later.unc sux 101: this is one of our most popular seminars every year. in this hour-long session, we will cover ways in which you can make fun of the neighboring school to our south. since most of you had never even been to north carolina before enrolling in our program, we will give you tips in criticizing america’s first state university. we will provide you with the basic jokes, including: agriculture-themed curricula, having a lighter shade of blue, “what the hell is a tar heel anyway?” and “safety school”. time permitting, we will also cover “yo mama” and “you might be a redneck if…” jokes.be your own borat: inspired by an actual student presentation, all incoming fuqua students are encouraged to embrace the hilarious antics of sacha baron cohen’s “borat” character. this seminar will teach you how to create completely unoriginal borat-themed comedies. don’t be the last member of your family to imitate baron’s wacky antics. jagshemash!surviving durham: led by retired general tommy franks, this session will help you prepare for life in durham. using survival tactics developed by his soldiers in fallujah and the mountains of afghanistan, gen. franks will teach you how to protect yourself from the snipers and mortar attacks frequently seen in and around durham; live ordinance training will be included. using his techniques, you will be able to safely travel to durham’s 9th street, home to over 3 restaurants, 2 bookstores, a thrift store, and a coffee shop.unleashing your “inner” dook student: our final session will illustrate how to redesign yourself using everything learned thus far in orientation. we will use elements of prior sessions to develop whichever type of self-centered douchebag is right for you. local exotic dancers will be on hand to test the extent of your transition from “dook potential” to “dook material”.

darden plans second “innovation challenge”





the university of virginia’s darden school of business announced on wednesday that the school will host another “innovation challenge” this january. darden, which had a whopping 58 teams enter the contest that began on november 17th, failed to place any teams in the final round. the school’s dean had the following statement, “frankly, we’re not very good at ‘innovation’ [the dean made quotation signals with his hands when using this word], but we’re not quitters. that’s not the ‘darden way.’ the ‘darden way’ involves an aloofness and go-get-‘em attitude rarely seen at other institutions. therefore, we will have a better showing this january and we are requiring all uva participants, male and female, to wear bowties to this next event.” darden has entered 220 teams thus far in the upcoming january “innovation challenge.” the only other schools who have currently received invitations to the competition are northeastern montana state, strayer university and the university of phoenix. as of today, no companies have signed up to sponsor the event.
