rentals















thinking of buying, but would like to try the gem-2 before you buy?
our gem-2 is available for rent on a weekly basis in the u.s.a. and canada. when buying an instrument, we will deduct 1/2 of any rental fees in the previous 12 months towards the purchase of a new instrument.
