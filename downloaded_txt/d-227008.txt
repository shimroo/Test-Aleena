"kress foundation grant to support collaborative research on pigment trade"
sarah k. rich, associate professor of art history, and the center for virtual/material studies (cvms) at penn state have been awarded a kress history of art grant of $20,000, along with supplemental funding from penn state university libraries, to facilitate research into the transatlantic trade in pigments from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century.
the grant will support a collaborative research project titled “the political economy of colorants in the atlantic world, 1750-1850.” the project aims to uncover the economic and political contexts of the colorant trade in the americas, europe and africa, highlighting the relationships among artists and different trades while also situating colorants in the context of indigenous-settler relationships and the slave trade. colorants are dyes and pigments used for coloring materials.

faculty spotlight


daniel zolli



assistant professor of art history




daniel zolli (he/him/his) is a scholar of early modern european art, with a focus on art in 14–16th-century italy. his research interests include the materials and techniques of art; workshop practice; art’s theorization in oral tradition and popular folklore; and its interfaces with law. his current book project, entitled donatello’s promiscuous technique, examines that sculptor’s life-long preoccupation with material experimentation. it argues that donatello cultivated a practice, and a professional persona, willfully at odds with period efforts to locate sculpture among the “liberal arts.” donatello took his models instead from cunning enterprises aimed at transforming or dissimulating matter (e.g., prestidigitation, cosmetics, alchemy, idolatry, counterfeiting, adulteration), staking his authority on an ability to deceive viewers, and cloud their judgment, through a near-elemental craftiness.
