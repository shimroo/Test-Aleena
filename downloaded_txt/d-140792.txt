reviews









gerald, jordan and alfred are all friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the bicycle business. i have purchased three new bikes over the past 7 years and they all take pride in helping me with whatever i may require. i am very fortunate that they are but a short ride from my home and have enjoyed my dealings with them. they do their business by putting their customer first in my opinion. i will not hesitate to tell friends or prospective customers about them. jordan especially worked very hard to make my last bike purchase a reality. alfred has extreme knowledge of how a bike is supposed to function and i appreciate the little tweaks he performs for me to keep me riding.november 22, 2023steve simmons


i started with aiden bostic, who was very knowledgeable with customer friendly service, and finalized things with jordan the shop owner. what a great team !! i bought a demo giant ebike that i had ridden at western slope massanutten and aiden and jordan set me up on that demo ride with the very same bike i eventually bought. the bike was so fun and cool to ride i knew that was the ebike for me. i could not have had a more pleasant and satisfying experience. i highly recommend them if you are thinking about bikes, have questions or want to test ride one.november 12, 2023robert niber


i live an hour and a half away. when i need help jordan makes sure i get my big serviced while i wait! i have found the service to be top notch. i tell my friends and associates to go there for their bike needs. i could have purchased my aventon online for less than my purchase at mole hill but would have then not obtained the advantages i now obtain. i tell everyone that it's better to be in the "mole hill" family!october 11, 2023george kopcsak
