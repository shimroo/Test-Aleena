what our clients say
in our pursuit of superior customer satisfaction, we survey every client after every closing.








jeff hansen
jeff was very knowledgeable of the current market trends. he was very helpful and straightforward with how to structure an offer in today's market with the due diligence fees and accommodating the seller's needs and wants as well as ours. he is a professional in every aspect of the real estate business and responded quickly if we sent him a text message or called him any time of the day. he not only helped with the new purchase but used him to list my current home too!


erik tutor






brandon boyd
brandon makes the experience pleasant. she anticipates and problem solves with charm and knowledge. she's also fun to be with.


sharon mitchell






holly chapman
viewing properties long distance was a new experience for us. holly provided expertise that was beyond the call of duty. she attended every single phone call, attended every meeting with each company that we asked to meet with, took notes, and asked questions about things we sometimes didn't think to ask. there was absolutely nothing that we asked her to do that she did not provide! i would work with holly again and recommend her without hesitation. we look forward to a continued friendship with holly and the entire helen adams team.


bobby hinson






stan perry
stan understood the challenges with older owners in selling their home and was very attentive, professional and compassionate.


lloyd baucom






andy smith
andy is the absolute best there is! he is everything and more that you could ask for in a realtor. we moved from the midwest to charlotte, which is tricky, but knowing that andy had our back throughout this process left us at ease. he found us the right house, within the right timeframe, and helped us navigate all the inspections, hoa communications, negotiations with the sellers, etc. he definitely went above and beyond and displayed the true meaning of customer service. you will not be disappointed using andy smith as your go-to charlotte realtor.

michael krueger
michael krueger is prior air force like myelf and simply clicked from the start. however, i had no idea i was getting myself acquantied with such an honest realtor! he is absolutly filled with integrity in every area and provided excellent services. he communicated very well and often, never making us feel like we were intruding when we had questions at random times of the day. i absolutely loved his patience, kindness, and all the advice he'd share that really showed how much he cared about our wellware over him making a profit. he cares about people more than making money and it shows which is probably what makes him super successful! i will forever be working with michael krueger as long as i'm needing to buy homes in charlotte, nc. i will also forever talk about what an honest realtor he is that truly cares about his folks and you can always depend on him doing right by you.

zach markle
zachary has sold us 2 condos in a very competitive market. he listened to us and clearly understood our criteria. when properties became available he quickly informed us via email and phone so that we knew quickly there were available properties. zach has a friendly and professional demeanor that makes it easy to do business with. dependable and reliable are 2 words that describe him and his work ethic.

nicole hall
nicole is the best agent we've ever worked with! she was so professional, always prepared, knowledgeable and we felt she was already ahead of the game. we trusted all of her advice as we constantly felt that she had our best interest in mind. she was a joy to work with and made the selling process so simple for us!

holly webster
holly webster provided wonderful service to us as we transitioned from fl to nc. holly is knowledgeable of the area and was inquisitive to ensure she was meeting our needs and expectations. she was patient and kind as well as honest as we had specific needs in a market that was challenging at times. holly went above and beyond in visiting properties in the cold and rain to provide us with a virtual walkthrough of potential properties. thankfully, we were successful in finding the right property for us. we appreciate all she did to help us in our move to nc. thank you holly!


phillip murray






leize watkins
leize watkins was incredible to work with! she was always patient and understanding of the many questions i had as a first time home buyer. she was knowledgeable and took the time to talk through the process with me and show me as many homes as i wanted to see throughout the search. in a tough buyer's market, leize found me the perfect spot to call home! i would recommend her to anyone in the market!
