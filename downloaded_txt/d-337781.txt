animalsthe top 5 worst dinosaurs ever 


salvador bishopfebruary 10, 20231.5k views

when you think of dinosaurs, you probably think of the massive, ferocious beasts that ruled the earth for millions of years. but not all dinosaurs were created equal. in fact, some of them were downright terrible. here are the top five worst dinosaurs ever.
#5 – velociraptor
you might be surprised to see velociraptor on this list, given that it’s one of the most popular dinosaurs in pop culture, thanks to movies like jurassic park. but the truth is, velociraptor was a small, scrawny dinosaur that wouldn’t have been able to take down a human even if it wanted to. weighing in at only about 15 pounds and measuring just 3 feet long, velociraptor was more rat than the raptor. it’s no wonder that it went extinct 65 million years ago.
the velociraptor is a terrible dinosaur for a number of reasons. first, its size makes it ill-suited for hunting large prey. second, its claws are too small to do much damage. third, its teeth are not good for breaking through bone. finally, its eyesight is not very good, making it easy for prey to escape. in short, the velociraptor is not a very good dinosaur. other dinosaurs outclass it in almost every way. it is no wonder that velociraptors are not very successful predators.
#4 – sauropods
sauropods were a group of large, herbivorous dinosaur with long neck that flourished during the late jurassic and early cretaceous periods. sauropods were the biggest land animals that have ever lived, with … read the rest

hometypes of concrete drills used 


salvador bishopfebruary 20, 20222.2k views

 
drilling concrete is primarily used to install rebar and wire mesh for foundation reinforcement, cable trays, and conduit. there are many different types of concrete bits used, depending on the application and size of the hole needed. for small holes, there are diamond-tipped masonry bits. for larger holes, there are rotary hammers and core bits, which come in different sizes.
in concrete work, coring drills make small cylindrical cores from drilled holes allowing technicians to test properties of surrounding materials without having to take additional samples. this form of testing is often called a mini-bore, and a wide range of bit sizes can be used depending on the size of the hole needed to extract the core sample. some bits have replaceable carbide tips that extend their life and provide continuous performance throughout their working life under normal conditions. in normal usage, it takes approximately 1 minute per inch diameter for a handheld percussion drill to drill a 3-inch hole in the concrete.
types of concrete drills used
there are many different types of concrete bits that can be used to drill into concrete depending on the application and size required. the most common type of bit would be carbide-tipped coring bits or rotary hammer drills, which are generally used for smaller holes and where the concrete is either not too hard or has been previously drilled.
water jet equipment is generally used for larger holes and harder concrete, which uses high-pressure, high-speed water to bore through the concrete. … read the rest

california has many places of entertainment that residents and tourists enjoy. some include theme parks such as disneyland and knott’s berry farm and huntington beach and newport beach beaches. one form of entertainment that has been a craze for some is riding a mechanical bull. a mechanical bull is a device shaped like a bull, but it is controlled by a motor so that the “bull” keeps bucking. people ride these bulls for entertainment and fun even though they know they are fake.
this device aims to entertain people who want to have fun. the benefit of using mechanical bulls instead of real ones is that the device is safer and less expensive than buying a real bull.

healthsupersets for hypertrophy and muscle mass 


salvador bishopmay 17, 20211.5k views

 
a lot of people go to the gym and do a muscle group once with weights or resistance. this is not enough to increase hypertrophy and muscle mass, though. you need to use supersets for your muscles to grow bigger. according to drive train hustle’s article on supersets, a superset is when you perform two exercises back-to-back without any rest in between them. this is so that each one fatigues a different set of muscles while also allowing time for recovery before you move on to the next exercise.
a good hypertrophy superset to start with is the barbell bench press and dumbbell shoulder fly. you can also use a machine variation of these exercises if you cannot do them by yourself, such as on a smith machine or cable pulley system. just make sure that this exercise combination uses different muscle groups within your chest/shoulder area so it doesn’t overtax one set of muscles while neglecting others, which could lead to an injury.
compound sets versus supersets
a compound set is different from a superset but with the same use of two exercises for one muscle group. supersets are an advanced training technique that can slide in between sets of a longer workout to push you while also saving time. compound sets have an entirely different aim – to provide volume for a muscle group. a compound set is different than a simple set. with the goal of higher volume, this type of training includes two exercises … read the rest
