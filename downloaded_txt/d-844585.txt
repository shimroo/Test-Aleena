for bmw motorcycles, suburban
                                  machinery offers foot peg and handlebar
                                  adapters that improve comfort levels for both
                                  driver and passenger.

suburban
machinery
                                    designs and manufactures aftermarket
                                    components for motorcycles. our primary
                                    motorcycle products are rider positioning
                                    enhancements intended to make a bike more
                                    comfortable for owners who find the factory
                                    set-up causes discomfort during extended
                                    use.

                                    the factory designs are compromises of seat
                                    and foot peg positioning. owners come in a
                                    wide range of shapes and sizes; therefore,
                                    they frequently experience discomfort when
                                    riding extended distances. our kits provide
                                    improved comfort especially for the more
                                    mature touring rider.

                                    our products are designed to provide driver
                                    and passenger comfort and should not be
                                    modified after purchase. they are for street
                                    use only and should not be used in
                                    competition.

                          brake pedal.  on previous models the brake pedal
                          could be adjusted to a lower position to allow easier
                          access when using our lower footpeg kits. this feature
                          has been eliminated by the factory.  for safety
                          purposes, riders need to be aware of this fact and
                          adjust their riding technique.  suburban
                          machinery, inc. assumes no liability for these
                          changes.

limitation of liability:   
in no event shall suburban machinery, inc. be liable
                        for any direct, indirect, special, punitive, incidental,

                        whether in an action under contract, negligence, or any
                        other theory, arising out of or in connection with the

                        consequential or incidental damages, the above
                        limitations may not apply to you.
