  my sister and i went on a road trip along the west coast and wanted to make a typical stop in monterey and check out if the cannery row resembles the description in the book. luckily we decided to stay in pacific grove, not monterey which to us was not that attractive and discovered angela’s inn. the inn is absolutely beautiful. it is really rare to see a place with such love to detail. every wallpaper and furniture piece has it’s right place and of course very clean. you immediately feel welcomed and relaxed when you arrive there. the most amazing part of the inn, to us, was the pretty front yard with a little fountain and amazing seating areas in the sun. i spend my birthday there and as a sweet surprise we got an upgrade and got offered the beautiful suite under the roof, and a delicious piece of cake. it was so touching how much love and care that was put into the inn. i would recommend everyone to spend some time there, i would always come back!

  "we had the most pleasant experience while staying with veronica and her staff at this awesome b and b. we will return time and time again. the home is situated within walking distance of everything you would want to see. the restaurants are fantastic. nothing compares to veronica's cooking and the hospitality of all the staff that work there though. the grounds and rooms are beautiful. there are delicious cookies to have with your coffee that is freshly brewed for you all day long. we just cant say enough good things about the b and b, but particularly beautiful veronica and her wonderful staff."

  "this was a fantastic place to stay.. the location was excellent for both monterey and pacific grove, but best of all was the manager veronica who prepared delicious breakfast, cookies etc. cannot say enough about this place - a special find. barbara & mark"

  "....i 'run away from home' every year and for decades have stayed at the old st angela inn. the guests are enjoy a fantastic 'sit down' breakfast every morning with special attention to those,(like myself), who have dietary restrictions. i the afternoon there is a lovely table set with wine, finger food and a scrumptious 'sweet'to cap it all. i could run on for several more paragraphs, but i think you get a good understanding....this is the place to be....small and intimate but with a huge 'welcoming' atmosphere!!!"

  "beautiful bnb right down the road from the beach and a quick drive to the monterey bay aquarium and cannery row. the staff here was very accommodating and went above ad beyond my expectations. very good breakfast every day, good selection and variety, much better than those continental breakfasts provided by most hotels - and it was free!"

  "this bed and breakfast is perfect for a babymoon. my husband and i wanted to getaway for a few days and stay somewhere that was near monterey, but not too close so that we could have some peace and quiet. the vintage looks in our room really made it feel like home and unlike any other place i have stayed before. we could see the ocean from our room and we were only a 2 minute walk to the beach. great place to stay for a romantic getaway"
