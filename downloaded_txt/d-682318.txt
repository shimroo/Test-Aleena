3 minutes with a maine guide - “york pack”
here’s another  of lisa dehart’s “3 minutes with a maine guide” videos.  these short, focused videos provide practical, proven techniques based on her years of guiding.this short video highlights what she call a “york” pack - essentially a modernized wannigan or carry box.  tough, lightweight, waterproof, a good pairing with canoe packs and blue barrels.click on the photo, or here to watch the video.  click here for the full gear playlist.

john w. - flat water trim
another of my favorites is john w. - this one on flat water trim.  he talks about a couple of basic concepts and demonstrates the impact on control of boat direction of running bow heavy or stern heavy in moving water.  it’ amazing how this bit of knowledge can make your paddling some much more in control.this technique applies whether the water is moving fast or slow.enjoy!click on photo or here here to watch…
