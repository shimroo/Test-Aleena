cirt, a narha affiliated program, began in 1983 with money from a 4-h grant, borrowed horses and six riders. today, cirt is a not for profit organization staffed by a director, certified instructors and assistants, numerous volunteers and 10 horses. costs for the participants are kept as low as possible and scholarships are readily available for those in need, it is the sincere wish of cirt, that eventually this type of therapy will be available to all of those whom it may benefit.

riders, volunteers and staff members from cirt will be on hand at this yearâs show. we hope you get to meet them. it should make you feel good about your participation and support of the youth charity horse show.
