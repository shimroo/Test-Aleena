campus customs



 
 
think tradition.  experience our experience.
 
 
campus customs started in 1975 when our father opened a yale university memorabilia retail store directly across from the campus. the store is still open at that same location, and although our father is retired now, we continue to run the company, keeping his exceptional customer service tradition and ethical business practices as our top priorities. in short, we love what we do, and we love building long-term relationships with our clients.
we’ve expanded quite a bit over these last 45+ years to include large-scale screen printing and embroidery, web store design and online fulfillment, graphic design, and complete event merchandise services.
having everything housed in one production facility next door to the original store allows for quick turnarounds and gives us a competitive edge in the fast-paced, modern marketplace, while retaining a warm, team-built atmosphere.
we pretty much do it all, and we’re happy to do it. give us a shout and we’ll show you.
 
-joel and jeremy cobden
