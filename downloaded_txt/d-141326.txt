an examination of cycles in united states
          history

hi, i'm bill murray (no
        not that bill murray) and this is my timepage. i am a
        recently retired aerospace worker here in seattle , with a
        couple of grown kids out on their own and a house in the
        suburbs full of memories and artifacts. i migrated here
        nearly 60 yrs ago after a youth spent in the wilds of
        l. a . since i have
        accumulated so much history of my own, i would like to
        share a little with you. my history started in the middle of world war ii, but although i am a wwii baby, i've always felt that i didn't quite fit any of the
        stereotypical images of any of that crowd. i didn't identify with
        the gi's outlook and i was not totally in sync with the
        boomer mentality that emerged after wwii either. some time
        ago i read a book by william strauss and neil howe
        (s&h) called " generations "
        and i felt i got a little insight into this feeling of
        mine. according to s&h, i am sitting right in the gap
        between two powerful generations. i was born too late to
        participate and too early to celebrate. strauss and howe
        called my generation the "silent generation". well we'll
        see.

new:

i am beginning to make some changes in the organization of the timelines.  look for some more of my family history and more linkage to my blog.  if you see some blank spaces and duplicates, don't worry.  hopefully, i will get it cleaned up before long.
i would like to invite anyone who is
          interested in the timepage or its subject matter to join
          me at  my personal blog, taking my time or you can twitter me at takingmytime.
