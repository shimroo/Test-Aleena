land was purchased in 2020 to be apart of the growing landscape of west springdale, arkansas.
the project was designed and developed by erc. we will be selling the project to mia rose holdings and starting construction in april.
our design included several options to accommodate for the changing landscape that the pandemic created. we worked with the city of springdale to finalize a design that we both can be proud of for long term success.
