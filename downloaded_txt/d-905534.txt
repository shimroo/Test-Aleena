    arnold, warren william. inexpensive divorce in western australia: the matrimonial protection union
during the 1970s and 1980s warren arnold (who died in 1998) was a leading figure among those who were pressing for reform of the laws relating to divorce. he also set up a small business selling instruction kits, so that couples who wished to end their marriages, and were not at war with each other, could not only avoid the cost of employing lawyers, but would be more likely to remain on friendly terms if they had not been persuaded to take an adversarial approach by opposing legal representatives.
this book tells his story, and includes a large number of anecdotes, (some of them very amusing) about the situations that people get themselves into, and the procedures that in many cases could help them.
warrens account of his activities, which he decided not to publish when it was compiled in the 1980s because he feared that he might again become a target for the legal profession, has now been edited for warrigal press by john melville-jones. 67pp.

new york illustrator ken landgraf's fantastic illustrations are well known world wide. ken says his works, " ... feature gorgeous line work,  and sexy and voluptuous beauty." ken's interpretation of sheena the queen of the jungle and her rival rulah in very precarious positions attest to ken's talent. by a special agreement with ken, warrigal press has commissioned this famous illustrator to create a number of unique artworks to celebrate the great australian cover art of the classic australian pulp novels of the 1960s. these limited editions are ken's interpretations ( not the original artwork used) of the cover art of john slater's death island and slave of the apache and jim kent's the warrior gods. the images portrayed are quite brutal and may not be politcally correct in the post liberal "60s" context however the books that inspired these images were readily available in bookshops and newsagents around australia, (if you were brave enough to buy them!) to have a look at these classic covers click on the ken landgraf banner above, but be warned ...
