"hi glen. the kamparoo made it to our home in lima. it is a bit late and might rain so we plan to set it up tomorrow if the weather is nice. can we call you before we set it up? the tow truck drivers were all interested in it and colin the truck driver said he got calls from other truckers. can you send us some business cards we can hand out at campgrounds? canâ€™t wait to get started."Â mike
