our premium top quality longblock 
engines are fully remanufactured to the highest industry standards, and we pride 
ourselves on building engines using the latest in upgrades and improvements. 




we use only the highest quality parts on all of our 
		long block engines, and all engines are run tested prior to custom 
		crating and shipping. 


all of our better than rebuilt, quality remanufactured 
		engines have been 
		hot run-tested at 180f on a sim tester at speed allowing us to check 
		compression, test cylinder leak down, pump up the lifters, break in the 
		piston rings, view oil flow and oil pressure to each bearing in the 
		engine, impregnate the internal surfaces with zinc, verify valve timing 
		and measure each cylinder's piston ring drag on the cylinder walls.
