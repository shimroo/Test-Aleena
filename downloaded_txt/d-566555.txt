oregon green schools



our mission is to activate climate and sustainability leadership by providing an inclusive network and resources for students, schools, and communities.














exciting changes at ogs!



oregon green schools is shifting from a certification model to a student stipend model. we’re still supporting green schools and students, just in a different, more impactful, and equitable way!we’re also moving to new buildings institute (nbi)! nbi is a portland-based nonprofit that works to move buildings to zero energy and zero emissions. we’ll no longer be a standalone nonprofit, but will be a program housed under the nbi umbrella within the schools initiative that has an aligned mission and vision. learn more here.
