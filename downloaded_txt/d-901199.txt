if you have a standard, ranch-style home with a pitched roof, your cost will likely fall on the lower end of that range. if you have a larger, two-story home or a more complex roofline, your cost will be higher. and if you live in an area with a high cost of living, such as the northeast or west coast, your roofing costs will also be higher.
there are a number of factors that will affect the cost of your new roof, so it's important to get a few estimates before making a final decision. be sure to ask each contractor about the materials they'll use and whether they offer discounts or promotions. and be sure to get a written estimate that includes all the costs associated with your roofing project.
