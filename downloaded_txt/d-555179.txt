final charts, 2014 mariners season 

sigh, what a season it was. here are the final versions of the charts i was keeping throughout this dandy of an 87-75 season.

the pitching chart tracked each pitcher's number of pitches thrown, batters faced, and outs recorded. the end of the chart shows ratios for outs per 100 pitches, pitches per batter faced, and pitches per out recorded.

the hitting chart tracked each hitter's number of pitches thrown to them, and the number of plate appearances. the end of the chart shows the total number of pitches thrown to them, the total number of plate appearances, and the average number of pitches per plate appearance.

the runs chart is probably something for which i should have another name. it's the schedule laid out vertically, with bars of various length representing the number of runs the mariners scored or allowed.

the runs scored and runs allowed charts tracked how many times the mariners scored a certain amount of runs. mean and median runs are indicated as well.

the margin of outcome charts tracked how many times the mariners won or lost by a certain amount of runs. again, mean and median are indicated.

soon, mariners fans. soon.

mariners charts at the all-star break 

i guess i've come up with an excuse to post something.

those following me on the twitter have seen me post these charts about a half hour to an hour (that's the hope, anyway) after every mariners game.

one chart deals with the pitchers and keeps track of their pitch count, number of batters faced, and outs recorded. mostly my impetus for the pitching chart when i first did it last year was to have a quick graphical representation of how rested the bullpen arms were. basically i like to use it as a proxy for knowing which bullpen arms are most likely to appear on a given night. also tabulated are outs per 100 pitches (for the starters), pitches per batter, and pitches per out.

another chart deals with the hitters and keeps track of the number of pitches they see and their plate appearances. that chart also tabulates pitches per plate appearance.

a third chart shows the runs scored and runs allowed by the mariners over the schedule to date.  again, i mostly do it for the quick graphical representation of, for example, "hey, there's a bunch of long red bars to signify when the mariners gave up a bunch of runs in that stretch of games."

a fourth chart (or set of charts) shows the amount of occurrences in which the mariners scored and allowed a certain number of runs.

a fifth chart shows the amount of occurrences in which the mariners won or lost by a certain margin.

no, i absolutely do not expect the mariners to sneak their way into the postseason. i just don't think the offense has as much room to improve as the pitching does to decline. i don't think they'll be able to outhit any slumps by the pitching staff, etc.

mariners game-by-game runs charts 

i finally decided i should have a single place to put these before i end up with a bunch of them. i transferred the idea a bit from a similar element i put on the canucks full-season charts i construct. on those charts, i show the canucks' goals-assists-points numbers, but i had no direct reference to the magnitude of win or loss. transferring that idea over to mariners charts, i couldn't think of a good way to have the score bars on the same chart with the pitching and hitting charts, so the scores here get their own chart. i know baseball reference has the little run differential chart on its team schedule pages, and obviously i wasn't going to rip that off. having both the runs scored and runs allowed, however, gives you an idea of how crappy the mariners offense has been, and you can pick out the peaks and valleys in terms of the mariners' offense and the mariners' pitching.

anywhere, i have to link these before i forget where they are in my imgur account...
[edit 5 oct 2014, 10:35p - added 2014 chart]

2009 mariners runs
2010 mariners runs
2011 mariners runs
2012 mariners runs
2013 mariners runs
2014 mariners runs

follow me on twitter @dsportsandbrems where i normally have the current 2014 chart posted about an hourish after every game if i'm really on it.

2013 mariners scavenger hunt 

so i saw this and thought a mariners version absolutely had to be done.  wyatt arndt and j. bowman's canucks-related version of the scavenger hunt had 48 items for 48 games.  can we list 162 items for 162 games before the season starts?  i'll try.  i'll take suggestions.  i'll update this as i come up with more stuff.  i don't think this list will be static until we have the opening day roster.  these all pertain to things you would see on mariners broadcasts (typically these will be via root sports) or on the field.

2012 rick rizzs lazy/annoying nickname list 

the mariners open up stateside tonight.  one thing i find unbearable about the mariners' radio broadcasts are the nicknames that rick rizzs chooses for the players.  usually he just adds a -y suffix, which is incredibly lazy and quite frankly i think it emasculates the players (a bit) rather than make for a playful nickname.  basically i heard a radio broadcast and heard way too much of miggy and figgy during the game and wanted to put a fist through my radio.  really, this goes back quite a ways since i remember being pissed off over names like cammy and nelly and shiggy.  

anyway, here's the roster for the second opening night, in crappy rizzs-like nickname format.  i made up most of these in the "spirit" of rizzs nicknames, but the ones rizzs actually uses are noted.  


blake beavan - blakey, beavey
steve delabar - stevie, delly, barry
felix hernandez - king (consensus), kingy, licksy, herny, dezy
hisashi iwakuma - hisashiy, koomy
brandon league - brandy, leaguey
lucas luetge - lukey (confusing if used due to lueke), luetgey
kevin millwood - kevy, milly, woody
hector noesi - hecty, noesiy
erasmo ramirez - erasmy, rammy, rezzie
george sherrill - georgy, sherry
jason vargas - jasey, vargy
tom wilhelmsen - tommy, willy, helmy
john jaso - johnny, jasey, jasoy
jesus montero - jesusy, zeusy, monty
miguel olivo - miggy (rizzs staple), miguely, oly, olivoy
dustin ackley - dusty, ackleyy
chone figgins - choney, figgy (rizzs staple)
munenori kawasaki - mooney (rizzs is using this), munenoriy, kowy, kawasakiy, saky/saki
alex liddi - alexy, lexy, liddiy
brendan ryan - brendy, ryany
kyle seager - kylie, seagy, seagery
justin smoak - justiny, smoaky (rizzs might occasionally use this one)
michael saunders - mikey, saundy, saundersy
ichiro suzuki - ichi (rizzs staple), suzy, suzuki, zooky
casper wells - caspy, spury, wellsy


ugh.  lazy hockey nicknames are bad, but they're not this bad.

soon...? 

this will be incredibly awesome if they pull this off, especially for folks in kitsap county who take the bremerton and bainbridge ferries.  all four major sports (plus futbol) will be within walking distance from the ferry terminal.  maybe that'll get some more bremerton sailings.  

anyway, yesterday was a day i didn't think would happen for a long time.  they've still got a long way to go, but i'm pretty sure this is the best shot we'll get to bring back the nba and get the nhl.  for the record, i'll never turn my back on the canucks (they've given me too many good memories while the seattle teams have been awful or left town), but will more than gladly root for a second team for every game except the six or so per year when they face vancouver.  

what a time this is.

baseball flyover 2012 

going through referrer logs the past few years, it appears some of the most searched things on this site were the google earth screengrabs i did long ago of the 30 ballparks.  obviously, a bunch of them were outdated.  not to mention, some good folks out there have done 3d models of some of the ballparks.  go figure.  

note on a couple of the ballparks: apparently there isn’t any updated imagery in google earth for target field.  what shows up is a parking lot.  google maps tends to get updated imagery before google earth, however.  as for the new marlins ballpark, all the imagery shows a stadium that’s about 50% built.  

anyway, it was fun when i made the original post in 2006, so nearly six years later, here’s another...

just like last time, i tried to get an oblique perspective and i oriented the perspective to north.  

enjoy.  


american league
al west





al central






al east






national league
nl west






nl central







nl east






again, thanks to google earth along with the good folks (mouseover for credits) that bring us the imagery and the 3d models of the ballparks.
