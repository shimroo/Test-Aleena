								welcome 

								to the 
								harbor haus 


								in beautiful copper harbor, michigan
								


						without a doubt, the most frequently asked question at 
						the harbor haus is "can we have a table with a view?" 
						fortunately, that's an easy request to fill as we are 
						situated right on the shore of lake superior. through 
						our large picture windows, each guest has a beautiful 
						harbor view expanding onto the big lake. while dining, 
						it's not uncommon to see ore freighters in transit or 
						small marine traffic and kayakers taking in the 
						beautiful surroundings. all of this is framed by a patio 
						adorned with flowers and trees, providing a 
						german/austrian flavor. 

						we offer a vast dining menu featuring fresh local fish, 
						seafood, steaks and many more items, as well as ahi 
						flown in from hawaii the day after it was "swimming." 
						local berries and vegetables are utilized in the dishes 
						when available.
