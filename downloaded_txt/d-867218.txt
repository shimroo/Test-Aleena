scire desidero

		i desire to know
	


bentley’s longstanding motto “scire desidero – i desire to know,” is infused in the school’s curriculum. from kindergarten through 12th grade, students begin the journey of knowing the world, to knowing each other, and ultimately, knowing themselves. finding foundation through concrete knowledge, exploring creatively, and sharing in the joys of a vibrant and kind community, bentley students cultivate a lifelong pursuit of learning. through exciting coursework and the ability to chart their own path, every bentley student develops a personal drive to understand the world around them.

bentley students visit "the happiest place on earth!"
this past weekend, the bentley choir, chorus, jazz, and chamber students embarked on an unforgettable journey to disneyland!  our talented musicians performed on disneyland’s imagination campus at california adventure and participated in soundtrack sessions, where students contributed their own renditions of beloved disney films. this was a wonderful opportunity for bentley students to share their musical talents with a broader audience and get a firsthand experience of what it is like to be a professional studio musician.  in addition to performing, students (along with our wonderful us teachers/chaperones mr. brown, mr. mcwilliams, ms. espineli, mr. kallaby, and ms. brookshire) were able to enjoy two days at disneyland and california adventure, creating lasting memories together.  please join us to celebrate all the hard work of these musicians at our spring concerts on may 9 (choirs and chamber) and may 11 as we end the year on a high note!

first days back in the books!
there is nothing quite like the first day of a new school year. it was wonderful to welcome all students back to campus on wednesday.we saw lots of smiles, laughter, and fist bumps as teachers ushered students back into the classrooms for the new year. for those of us who have been here all summer, it was delightful to see and hear the halls filled with conversation again.
