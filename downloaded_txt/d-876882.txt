welcome to ebsa





we believe that community baseball and fast-pitch softball should be open to all. our no-cut programs ensure that all registered players will have the opportunity to fully participate. we believe that ability to pay should not be a factor and so offer financial aid to all who need it. we believe in the value of participating in multiple sports. we make every effort to keep the game in perspective, insisting that players, parents, coaches, and umpires treat one another with respect.
