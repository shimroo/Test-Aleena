the menu is small but everything is delicious and fresh. definitely try the family lunch if available. we already miss our breakfasts and we’re sad to only have one day with the sea bar. best pizza and kebobs!

our drivers, our tour guides, the office staff and barracuda gang went above and beyond for every task and request. ruger, the 19-yr old resort dog, was a bit temperamental but always happy, and he was my one son’s favorite resort member. the local boys were my other son’s favorite people. they hung out every day.

cabana rooms are clean, spacious, comfortable. we stayed in scarlett mccaw and our boys in garden haven. two separate rooms/entrances in one cabana. perfect for our family. water pressure and toilets are slower here. and that was ok once we adjusted our attitudes. 

we were hardly ever in the rooms because we were busy with our adventures and being outside. everything being arranged and scheduled for us made this experience so amazing that we are already planning our next trip. 

snorkeling, jungle horse, xunatunich, cave tubing, monkey river and zip lining at angel falls. we saw sharks, schools of fish, beautiful coral, monkeys, crocodiles, bats, toucans, pelicans, ruins that are thousands of years old, and the cleanest water around. we learned so much about hopkins, belizeans, culture and history . all of our drivers and guides were passionate. 

weather had canceled an adventure so when we begged for some magic from melanie and lauren. not only did they rearrange our last two days for us but they sent us to a more extreme zip lining company snd i’m so grateful because it was the highlight for all of us. definitely request angel falls if you are the adrenaline seeker. i’m not. i survived. i get motion sick and don’t like heights but frisco and jose made me feel so safe and comfortable that i would do it again. 

we did not need as much cash as we brought. restaurant gratuity can be added to the room. we tipped our drivers and guides in cash. souvenirs in cash are a little cheaper but most places take credit cards.

there are shops in dangriga airport. you can buy sunscreen and bug spray there. we brought 4 sunscreen and 2 bug sprays. needed extra bug spray; we had sun protective clothing and i had a neck fan. 

rent the golf cart. go into hopkins. it felt like the safest place on the planet. if you want other snacks, go to the grocery store. i know it might seem different to eat at only certain times when you’re on vacation but it was plenty and perfect (except your arrival travel day if you were like us - we were a hot mess that first day, and they loved on us like family). 

i will be back. i see a ladies trip in my future. read less  - shehla
