welcome to the 
            virtual vine!


the virtual vine is a 
            resource for early childhood teachers, preschool through second 
            grade. it's a site filled with ideas and activities  to make 
            teaching and learning fun through themes and units, displays, 
            literacy and math connections.  you can also tour my classroom, 
            find teacher inspirations and tips, website help, printables, links galore, 
            and a whole host of other things as well. included are things that i've done in
my classroom as well as ideas that have been shared among teachers, hence
the site name, the virtual vine. i hope you find lots of things that you
can use in your own classroom. thanks for stopping by and i hope you come
back often.
update: in 2014 i 
						  retired from teaching.  teaching was such a huge 
						  part of my life i was afraid to take that gigantic 
						  step, although i knew it was time.  but although 
						  i have missed the students, my friends and the parts 
						  of teaching i loved, it was the right decision and 
						  i've loved retirement!  i have gone back and done 
						  some teaching part time and i still dabble in online 
						  educational resources.  sadly, i have yet to 
						  spend any time updating the virtual vine and have put 
						  that time into my blog
						  
every day is the 
						  weekend.  so stop by and take 
						  a peek, you'll even find some free teaching resources 
						  there .... just like always.  ;)
