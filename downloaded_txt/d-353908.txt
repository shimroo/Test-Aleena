a radical new approach to recoveryreverse therapy is an educational process that teaches people to identify the triggers which prompt the brain to create symptoms such as fatigue and unexplained pain. as soon as we understand the reasons for these ‘alarm signals’ then awareness is raised and we start to 'listen' to bodymind. establishing the source of bodily distress, then taking action to relieve that distress. thereby enabling the body to ‘turn off’ the symptoms.
