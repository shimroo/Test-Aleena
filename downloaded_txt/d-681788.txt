general information
  course goal: to develop a basic understanding of probability and statistics and
  how they relate to the world around us.  
final exam in the fall semester 2012
  will follow the regular exam schedule.  
(see more information about grading
  and attendance policy below) 
textbook for fall semester 2012:  
moore, d.s.  (2010) essential statistics.
  1st edition. 
software: most sections will
  use minitab in class. minitab is available in all the computer labs at
  etsu.  
note.  students who acquired the 'bundle' have on
  addition to the textbook and study guide a student version of minitab. there
  are other options available to acquire or rent minitab for students that want
  to have it at home but this is not required, students will find minitab in
  all the computers on campus under 'statistical software.

grading and
  attendance policy

    

departmental final examination requirement
  for math 1530: 

a comprehensive
       departmental final examination will be administered in math 1530
       (probability & statistics).  
for the fall semester 2012 the exam will be held during
       the regular final exam schedule.
the room will be
       announced by your instructor during dead week.
important: each student
       must have a current, official etsu id card to take final exam.
the final
       examination will count 20% of each students grade.  for extremely
       low scores on the final examination (less than 80 points (or less than
       40%) of the maximum of 200 points), the student will be assigned a
       semester grade of f. 
the purposes of this
       program are to increase learning, enhance quality control and minimize
       grade disparity among instructors.

grading for the course:  the grade will be based on a possible 1000 points (200
  from the final examination, 100 from capstone project, 50 from practice
  quizzes and 650 determined by the instructor).  the scale follows: 



a


950 
    1000             


 


c+


780 
    799               




a-


900  949


 


c


720 
    779               




b+


880 
    899              


 


c-


700  719 




b


820 
    879               


 


d+


650 
    699              




b-


800  819 


 


d


600  649 




f total less than 600 or for academic
    misconduct or an extremely low grade (less
    than 80) on the final examination.



practice quizzes:  there are 16
  chapter quizzes in desire2learn (d2l). there is no time commitment and
  unlimited attempts to complete these quizzes but you must get at least 75% of
  the questions correct on a chapter quiz to get full credit (3 points) on that
  quiz.  you will receive 2 points for
  attempting all quizzes.  all quizzes must be taken one hour prior to the final exam. 
bonus points for good attendance (after the
  first week of classes):  you may receive a bonus
  for good attendance (we
  dont count absences occurring during the first week of the semester).  an
  absence can only be excused by presenting instructor with an official etsu
  class absence authorization for student participation in a
  university-sponsored activity prior to the occurrence of the
  absence.  no other types of absences will be excused even if
  you have an impeccable reason for not being in class.  we interpret the
  number of absences recorded for a student as an indication of the amount of
  lecture material they have missed during the semester, not as a critical judgment
  of that students character, motivation and honesty.  bonus points will
  be awarded in the following manner:
                                   
  5 absences or more                
  zero bonus points
                                   
  4 absences                              
  10 bonus points
                                   
  3 absences                              
  20 bonus points
                                   
  2 absences                              
  30 bonus points
                                   
  1
  absence                                 40 bonus points
                                   
  0 absences                              
  50 bonus points  
departmental attendance
  requirements: 
(approved by department vote on
  february 28, 1994; revised july 1999*) 
the department of
  mathematics strongly advises students to attend all mathematics classes when
  physically able.  because there is a positive correlation between
  attendance and student success in mathematics, the following attendance
  guidelines will be used in all mathematics courses.  regardless of the
  reasons for the absences, should a student exceed the following limits, the
  instructor has the authority to assign a grade of fn or f; this policy takes
  precedence  over the grade assignment policy for math 1710 and math
  1530: 
7 absences for
  classes scheduled for mwf. 
5 absences for
  classes scheduled for tr or mw classes or

    any other 2 day/night classes. 
3 absences for classes
  scheduled for one evening per week. 
9 absences for all
  daytime sections of 4-hour classes. 
* for summer
  courses:       5 absences for classes scheduled
  mtwxf.

  distributions with graphs



skills
    &
    knowledge
    in chapter 1






chapter
    1. after reading this chapter make sure you can:

identify
         individuals and variables in a given story. (see who? how many? what?
         why? questions on page 4)
distinguish
         between categorical and quantitative variables 
based
         on the nature of the variable, be able to decide which graph is
         appropriate for a given data set: 

·        
    histograms
    and stemplots (stem-and-leaf display)? 
·        
    bar
    and/or pie charts?
·        
    time
    plots?

understand what a
         histogram or stemplot tells you about the
         behavior of the variable. what is a bimodal or a skewed left or skewed
         right distribution telling you?

in the lab 
    chapter  1



ideas that can be used in the stat
cave for graphing and displaying data
1)     
    lab
    'drugs' : 
    the purpose of this lab is to get familiar with data files and do basic
    graphs for categorical and quantitative variables
data file:  drugsurv.mtw
(data from drug and alcohol survey in a state for
    the midwest) 
(variables in this data set are: gender, years of education, smoking
    status, having tried marijuana and alcohol dependency)
      a more simple version of that lab that can be used the first day in
    the lab to introduce students to the use of minitab can be found in : plabdrugs.doc
2)     
    work  1.33, 1.34, 1.44 from the book
3)     
    explore and discuss the distribution of the
    variables in one or more of these data files
a)     
    surveys02.mtw  (has categorical
    and quantitative variables: gender, age, number of siblings etc. of
    students in a section of math 1530) 
b)    
    pulse rates of 210 students of a math 1530 course pulserat.mtw    
    pulserat.sav
(interpret the shape, what pulse rates are more common? which ones are
    less frequent?) 
c)     
    age at time of death, sample of 135
    graves from greenhill cemetery laramie, wyo, data include people who died
    in the period 1860-1998) (why
    does the distribution of age at time of death looks bimodal? get
    separate graphs for those who died before and after 1950. )  greenhill.mtw   
d)    
     unemployment in tennessee. this data set contains the
    monthly unemployment rate in tennessee
    from january 1978 to april 1999. tennunem.mtw
     obtain a histogram
    and interpret it. obtain a time plot and interpret it.
4)     
    using applets from the www. the applet
    (from rice
university) at http://www.ruf.rice.edu/%7elane/stat_sim/histogram/index.htm
allows you to explore how a interval width
    affects the shape of the histogram
  



 




in the real world
    chapter 1


statistics is a
    useful tool to explore the real world. 
here are some data files with real data. think of the context of
    the data, get acquainted with the variables and identify the type of each
    variable. 
1) sat related variables for 50 states and dc (moore's basic practice of statistics) minitab: sat.mtw spss:
    sat.sav
2) demographic and economic data from for 97 countries
    (from rouncefield)
rouncefield, m. (1995)  the statistics of poverty and
    inequality . journal of statistics education v.3, n.2 (1995)  
(data source : united nations
    in 1990). (variables in this data file are: 
(birth rate, death rate, infant mortality rate, life expectancy
    for males and females, gross national product) 
minitab:  poverty.mtw  spss: poverty.sav

3)
real data from the usa:
    census bureau
    web site, unemployment data bureau of labor statistics, the university of chicagos national opinion research
    center

    knowledge
    in chapter2

     


chapter
    2. after reading this chapter make sure you know how to:

calculate
         and interpret the values of mean, median, quartiles, five number
         summary, standard deviation
draw
         a boxplot & compare several data sets in
         terms of center and spread by looking at the side by side boxplots.
decide
         if an observation is an outlier using the 1.5 iqr rule
relate
         the skewness of the distribution to the
         relative position of the mean and the median
relate
         the standard deviation with a histogram

also you should be
    aware of how extreme observations affect numerical summaries.

in the lab 
    chapter 2


ideas that can be used in the stat
cave for summarizing distributions with numbers

1) lab
    big toe this lab reviews topics of chapters 1 and 2.

2) lab infant mortality the objective of this lab is to interpret the shape of
    histograms, interpret side by side boxplots,
    calculate and interpret basic statistics. it reviews topics from chapters 1
    and 2.  it  uses rouncefield's poverty
    data (variables in this data set are birth rate, death rate, infant
    mortality rate, life expectancy for males and females, gross national
    product for each one of 97countries)  
    
minitab: poverty.mtw 
3) lab sat scores
(statistics and graphs for quantitative variables) sat scores  for
    50 states and dc (moore's basic practice of statistics) (variables
    are sat math and verbal average scores, % of high school seniors
    taking the sat,  etc.)  minitab:
sat.mtw
4) lab baseball 
    a short lab with the baseball players salaries (histogram, median,
    mean, side-by-side boxplots)
5) lynx spiders 
    a biologist wants to compare the lengths of female and
    male green lynx spiders.  [probability and statistical inference, 7th
    ed.]  
6)
    the minitab data file oldfaithful contains data
    on eruptions of the old faithful geyser in yellowstone national park. the
    variable named "duration" records how long 299 of these eruptions
    lasted, in minutes. describe the shape, center, and spread of the
    distribution. [the basic practice of statistics, 3rd ed.]
7) the
    minitab data file calories contains
    data from a study showing that foods advertised as "low calorie"
    often contain more calories than the label states. is the degree of
    understatement of calories the same for national (n) brands, regional (r)
    brands, and locally (l) prepared foods? the variable measured is the
    percent difference between true and label calories (i.e., true% - label%). [the basic practice of statistics, 3rd ed.]
8) open the applets (statistical applets) from the
    bps4e cd. the mean and median applet
    on the bps4e cd allows you to place points (data) where ever you want and
    it shows the dotplot and locates the mean and the
    median. useful to explore the relationship among mean, median and the skewness of the distribution.

ideas
    that can be used in the stat
cave for correlation
    and regression.
1)
lab body
    fat (correlation and regression) which is better
    predictor of body fat; waist or weight?  uses the data file bodyfat.mtw 
 
2) lab
    wine-heart (correlation and regression) are wine consumption and
    heart disease related? uses the data file wineheart.mtw  

 
3)
lab oldfaithful correlation 
    are the length of eruption and the time until next eruption related? 
    oldfaithful.mtw 
4) lab oldfaithful regression  can we predict when the
    next eruption of old faithful will be? 
    data: oldfaithful.mtw
5)
    this is a very appropriate data set to discuss outliers in regression:
    obtain the scatter plot, fit the regression equation with and without the
    observation for the usa
    and compare r-square for both models. cigarette and lung cancer (friedman
    et. al) cigaret.mtw   cigarret.sav  
6) lifeexpect.mtw
(cause-effect relationship?)
7) using applets  in the www:
     a)
guessing the value of r from a scatter plot  (university of illinois) 
     b) rice u 'regression by eye' applet 
     c) to
    discuss leverage and influential points:
           you place the points with
    the mouse where you want and the (u of
    illinois) applet calculates r and the regression line  
       you move the points, displays
    r, sse and line calpoly linear regression
    applet 
       you move one point, displays r
    and line
west's regression applet
      d)  correlation and regression applet  from

ideas
    that can be used in the stat cave for probability
    want to (virtually) flip a coin?
1) using applets from the cd. explore
    the probability applet
    from (statistical applets)
    on the bps4e cd. this
    applet simulates flipping a coin and keeps track of heads and tails.

2) using applets in the www. 
    you will also find generators of random numbers in  http://www.random.org
probability as relative frequency in the long run:  go to
http://www.random.org
    and flip the coin 50 times. keep track of the number of heads that you get.
    based on this experience, what is your estimate for the probability of
    heads for that coin? (50 realizations of the random experiment of flipping
    a coin is not really the 'long run'). each student can report how many head
    he/she got in his/her 50 trials and we can come up with another estimate of
    the probability.

    homework
    chapter 21


here
    you will find an introduction to the chisquare test chisq.doc
we recommend that you practice with the following exercises: (when
    possible use minitab to solve.) 1,2,4-9,13,15-18,21-23,27,31,35,37-39
 
 
your instructor might assign specific homework to be graded

ideas
    that can be used in the stat cave for the chi-square test
 
1)
    lab on test of independence with the drug survey example. data are in drugsurv.mtw
2) labchisq.doc is
    a lab that includes the goodness of fit test and the test of independence.
3)
    use the titanic data (dawson): produce two-way tables and chi-square tests
    to find out if
   
    a) gender made a difference in survival 
   
    b) class made a difference in survival

chapter 6 
two-way tables




skills in 
  chapter 6


after studying this chapter, you should:

know how to produce a two way table from raw data
       for two categorical (or categorized) variables
be able to get marginal and conditional
       distributions from a two way table 
feel comfortable interpreting 'row and column
       percentages' (conditional distributions) and compare groups based on
       that interpretation 
an association or
       comparison that holds for all of several groups can reverse direction
       when the data are combined to form a single group. this reversal is
       called simpson's paradox.





 
  homework
  for chap. 6


we recommend that you practice with the following
  exercises: 6.1-6.3,6.5,
  6.7-6.18,6.24,6.28,6.30,6.31
simpson's paradox exercises: 6.7,6.8,6.30,6.31

your instructor might assign specific homework to be graded.

  chapter 6


ideas that can
  be used in the stat
cave for two-way tables
1) lab drugs-two
  way. we work again with the file
drugsurv.mtw (data from drug and alcohol survey in a state
  for the midwest) now trying to compare
  females and males and to observe associations between variables. 

2) you can produce your own two-way tables for
  gender or class and survival with the titanic data. did the same percent of
  males and females survived? did the same percent of women survive in the
  first class than in the third class? minitab: atitanic.mtw

  titanic data: gender, class, and survival for the titanic adult passengers
  (crew not included).  
 
3) a study was
  conducted to see if there was an increased risk of contracting hepatitis c
  associated with having a tattoo. tattoos (source: intro stats by de veax & velleman 2004)
 
4)  a large
  sample survey interviewed a random sample of young adults in 2000 and 2001.
  one questions asked was, where do you live now? that is, where do you stay
  most often? where do
  college-age young adults live?  (source:
  the basic practice of statistics)
