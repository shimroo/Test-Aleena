welcome




























bottles of hope are small glass bottles covered with polymer clay and given to cancer patients. they symbolize a wish and a hope for health
this project was started in 1999 by a rhode island cancer survivor and has spread internationally. bottles are made by artists, students, survivors, seniors and many more who volunteer their time and love.
this video was taken at the ferguson public library in stamford, ct
the bottles of hope workshop was held on saturday, feb. 4, 2017. it was a great time! some of the participants had never worked with polymer clay before. they all did a great job and had lots of fun!
