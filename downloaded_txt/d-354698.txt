laurie’s new special




“kilmartin has become one of the most fearless, respected performer-writers in the l.a. stand-up scene over the last three decades.”

— l.a. times



cis woke grief slut



laurie kilmartin is an emmy nominated writer for conan, a new york times best selling author and a longtime standup comic. laurie went viral in 2020 for live-tweeting jokes about losing her mother to covid, and again in 2022, after sean hannity targeted her on fox news for making an abortion joke. laurie loves finding the silly side of serious topics, and her new special, cis woke grief slut, is proof that not every gen x standup has morphed into an alt-right grump.
