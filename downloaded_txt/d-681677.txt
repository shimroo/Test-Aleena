	 student loan consolidation guide
	 
    


student loans are loans that are offered to students to assist in payment of the costs of professional education. the government of the country offers these loans and at a very low rate of interest.student loans are a great help to students who plan to do further studies, in their own country or abroad, but lack the requisite funds to do that. in this way student loans not just assist the student but also his family.many institutes and universities offer student loan. there are different types of student loans. so there are several options available for students to choose from. broadly there are two types of loans available: federal loans and private educational loans.the students opting for federal students loan program are funded and administered initially through the us department of education’s federal student aid programs. these loans are the easiest to get student loan consolidation services. the federal student loan programs disburse about $60 billion a year. stafford loans are the most common form of federal loans for students.private student loans are administered by standard lending institutions. the most commonly opted loans in this are sallie mae signature and the citibank student loan. these organizations provide unsecured loans to a student and charge hefty interest on it.a student can combine the private and the federal loans to gather funds for his further studies. however a student should bear in mind that these two loans should not be combined or consolidated. he should consolidate his federal loans first and then separately consolidate privately the student loan debt.student loan consolidation refers to building all your student loans into a single loan with one lender and one repayment plan. you can plan to consolidate your loan like refinancing a home mortgage. the time you consolidate your loan, the balances of your other current loans are paid off, with the total balance playing over into one consolidated loan. however at the end you will be left with just one student loan to pay off. the student loan can be consolidated by the student as well as his family i.e. parents.there are several benefits of consolidating a student loan. for instance loan consolidation offers lower monthly payments, combining of your student loan payments into just a single monthly bill and the lock or the stoppage loan consolidation puts in a fixed, usually lower, interest rate for the term of your loan thereby saving thousands of dollars as per the interest rates of your original loan.source: http://articlealley.com/article_76418_19.html

since 6 billion or so such pitches went out last year, my chances of winning that bet are awfully good. that's a record number of such mailed card offers -- 20 each for every man, woman, child (and a few pets as well) in the united states.why spend the $1 billion-plus in postage? while consumers respond about as well as you'd suppose given they are being inundated with unsolicited material urging them to take on even more debt, the meager 0.3% acceptance rate was enough to generate 18 million new card accounts in 2005.our lead story looks at the latest data on credit-card mailings and tells you what you can do to halt the onslaught, or at least protect yourself from unintended consequences of improper disposal. read the consumer watch column, plus find out how nanotechnology's promising breakthroughs in drug therapies and diagnostic techniques and see why workers and their employers aren't yet seeing eye to eye on the logistics of staying on the job in retirement, on friday's personal finance pages.credit-card marketers think of those millions of mailboxes as one big trout stream: throw out enough lines and some fish will bite.source: http://www.marketwatch.com/

	 military access to payday loans should be protected; independent study finds no data to support predatory claims
	 
    


military enlisted personnel have the same short-term credit needs as their civilian counterparts, and should not be denied access to payday loans and other short term credit products. so says a study by william o. brown jr., ph.d. of the university of north carolina greensboro, and charles b. cushman jr., ph.d. of george washington university. the study "compensation and short-term credit needs of u.s. military enlisted personnel", was funded by the consumer credit research foundation, a non-profit research group.the report's findings refute recent calls for the department of defense to limit active duty military personnel's access to payday loan products.according to the report, "attempts to eradicate some forms of short-term credit through regulation invite perverse and predictable unintended consequences." the study concludes that "a more rational approach is to promote free and highly competitive markets for consumer-credit products of all kinds and to empower consumers to make informed decisions based on valid information appropriate for their own circumstances."- the pricing of banks’ overdraft-protection services is often not obvious to consumers of these services. consumers cannot use their financial education to select products best suited for them unless the costs of those products are amply disclosed and unless those products are free of deceptive or hidden material terms.- promote robust competition for every form of financial service. competition drives down prices and increases options for consumers.- consumers should have a variety of financial products at their disposal and should be able to make educated and informed decisions based on accurately and fairly disclosed prices and terms.- there is no principled reason for limiting the access of military enlisted personnel to short-term credit. both the marketplace and individual data suggest a continuing need and substantial demand for short-term credit among military enlisted personnel.- there exist no data from which it can reasonably be concluded that military personnel should be denied access to any form of credit that is available to civilians. while certain forms of credit may have lower cost and terms that are more favorable than others, vigorous competition in the marketplace — with terms fully and prominently disclosed — should be adequate to enable intelligent consumer choice.source: http://www.rtoonline.com/content/

	 exciting new appointment for my payday loan
	 
    


as part of its continuing growth, mem consumer finance ltd, parent of my payday loan has appointed a new member to its senior management team.[clickpress, wed apr 26 2006] the company, which operates three other payday loan brands in addition to my payday loan: month end money, payday uk, and payday store; is joined by nick auchincloss as head of corporate development. nick has joined the team to explore new avenues and business opportunities for the company within the short term loan and financial markets.a former sales manager at leading uk loan company, hfc bank plc and fx brokers, exchange direct plc, he has recently project managed sponsorship programmes for organisations including the ministry of defence, playmobil, lego and coca-cola. he has also consulted on a number of projects within the payday loan industry itself. nick explains how this varied experience will help in his new role: “i’ve been lucky to have had some great opportunities in the past and joining mem will allow me to make the most of the skills i’ve learnt.in my previous roles i’ve worked in both business to business and business to consumer environments, giving me a good feel for consumer needs and business partnerships, both essential in my new job. i’ve always enjoyed working on new projects from developing new insurance products at hfc bank to going racing with the territorial army!mem offers me the perfect opportunity to continue doing this and doing it well! payday loans are an exciting new product in the financial market, providing a short term financial cushion for customers in the prime market”. some of the new products nick auchincloss has been working on since joining the business are already in the testing and pilot phases and will soon be available to the consumer.“when developing new products, it’s important to ask, ‘is it something i would buy?”, and a few things have come to mind that offer our customers an extension of the payday loan service they already enjoy. there won’t be major scale changes to our core lending business, merely the introduction of complimentary products that meet different needs”.in addition to looking at new products, nick will be working on ways of streamlining the business to maximise efficiency and the speed of response to my payday loan’s customers. “the customer is all important and with the growing awareness of the payday loan industry and increase in applications for what are effectively top-up loans, we need to continue our business development to maintain and improve our high standards of customer service”, nick states.iain mckenzie, ceo of mem consumer finance ltd commented on the new appointment, “nick comes with a wealth of relevant experience which will help us in successfully delivering short term financial solutions to the consumer.the presence of a strong senior management team allows our loan advisers to focus on providing excellent customer service when offering payday loans”.notes to editors:my payday loan offers loans between £80 and £1000 (subject to status) repayable on the customer’s next payday. payday loans are helpful to people to bridge unexpected financial shortfalls or provide additional funds from time to time as the need arises. applying for a payday loan could not be easier – anyone finding themselves caught unexpectedly short before payday just needs to go online to payday loans and fill out the bespoke application form which is then automatically processed.the customer is immediately given an indication of whether or not they qualify for a loan and provisionally and for how much they would be approved. they are can then send the necessary documentation across quickly and, if approved, have their funds deposited the same day.existing customers have it even easier – in most cases they can complete loan renewals online, always helpful in the event they need that little extra cash.source: http://www.clickpress.com/releases/detailed/12041005cp.shtml

	 health insurance woes lead some doctors to opt out
	 
    


kansas city, mo. - you go to the doctor. you pay the doctor.what could be simpler?following a practice that would have been typical in the 1960s, some doctors have decided not to accept health insurance.patients of these doctors pay the whole charge — at the time of the visit or after the doctor sends them a bill. for patients who have health insurance, it is up to them to get reimbursed by their health plans.doctors who go this route — an estimated 35,000 or so across the country — say they gain autonomy and independence by opting out of an increasingly dysfunctional health-insurance system."it keeps me working for the patient. i don't have to answer to the insurance company first," said john dunlap, an overland park, kan., internal-medicine physician who has never worked through insurance companies since beginning his practice in 1980.despite the allure, those deciding to work outside the health-insurance system are more of a trickle than a flood. health care industry studies suggest that roughly 90 percent of doctors are affiliated with a managed-care plan, and those numbers have not moved much in recent years."our physician-turnover rate in our networks is significantly less than 1 percent," said susan johnson, a spokeswoman for blue cross and blue shield of kansas city. "we just don't see many physicians leaving our networks."patients have their own reasons for agreeing to such cash-and-carry arrangements — but it is generally not about saving money.it is the "quality of care, the personalized attention," said jari holland buck, a patient of jane murray, a mission, kan., doctor who does not accept insurance payments.murray is medical director of the sastun center of integrative health care. she practices what she describes as "open-minded" family medicine — conventional treatments with a heavy emphasis on nutrition, lifestyle and other nonpharmacological treatments.murray stresses the importance of the doctor-patient relationship."i don't want to be the intermediary between the payer and the patient," she said. "when the person has a direct financial covenant with me, it's clear that they're my boss."why do this?going to a doctor who does not accept insurance may actually cost patients more money because the doctors work outside of any insurance network."i establish my own fees, based on reasonable charges," dunlap said.chuck wiedenhoft, who had an appointment in march with dunlap for a physical, said he would probably save money if he went to a doctor in his health-plan network.the 56-year-old overland park resident chooses to go to dunlap for peace of mind."it's the confidence in the quality of the service i get, and the confidence i have in him as a doctor," he said.longer visits with the doctor are a draw for patients like mike palmer, who has been going to dunlap for three years. the 60-year-old leawood, kan., resident is retired but still does consulting for his former employer, which provides him with health coverage.palmer said his physical in march with dunlap took about an hour."besides going over my test results, he asked about my family and how i was doing emotionally, how i was doing exercisewise," palmer said.dunlap mails him a bill, palmer said, and a standard insurance form that lists services and charges. palmer pays the bill, then signs the insurance form before sending it to his insurer. the insurer reimburses palmer or the amount goes toward his out-of-pocket deductible.murray also has a set fee schedule "based on what i feel is a reasonable compensation also might pay more than if they went to doctors in their insurance networks.while murray said she normally does not negotiate charges with patients, she sometimes lowers fees for patients going through tough financial times, especially if she has treated them for an extended period."i couldn't do that if i had signed contracts with insurance companies," she said.more time with patientsmurray said working outside the insurance system enabled her to spend more time with patients, which leads to better outcomes and fewer visits.the leawood, kan.-based american academy of family physicians said that the typical family doctor sees about 85 patients in an average week, or about 17 a day.dunlap and murray said not dealing with insurance companies enabled them to operate with smaller clerical staffs, which saves money.for some doctors, that savings has translated into a reduction in fees.vern cherewatenko, a family-practice physician in renton, wash., said he was able to cut his fees by 30 percent to 50 percent when he stopped dealing with health insurance companies.less record keeping"we don't have to bill and keep track of accounts receivable," said cherewatenko, the founder of simplecare, which advises doctors on how to operate a practice this way. "it's just like eating a meal at denny's."in 2002, the center for studying health system change, a nonpartisan research group, reported that nine out of 10 u.s. physicians contracted with at least one managed-care plan between 1997 and 2001. that, of course, means that one out of 10 — or about 35,000 doctors — did not.alwyn cassil, a spokeswoman for the washington-based group said a new study, expected to come out in early may, would show a small increase in the proportion of practicing physicians who did not contract with managed-care plans.no big exodus"there is no exodus of large numbers of physicians from managed-care contracting," she said.according to the american medical association, 88.1 percent of u.s. physicians participated in managed-care plans in 2001, the latest year for which it has data.that percentage probably has not changed much, said texas physician james rohack, immediate past chairman of the ama's board of trustees.most doctors who practice without insurance company involvement care for relatively well-off patients or, at the other extreme, provide care mostly to indigent patients who lack insurance, rohack said.other variablesthere are a number of other variables that come into play, such as the kind of physician.for example, cassil said about one in three psychiatrists practices without managed-care contracts, about three times the rate of other doctors. cassil said many psychiatrists feel constrained by low reimbursement rates from health insurers.one development that may encourage this type of practice is health savings accounts, which the bush administration is promoting as a way to lower health-care costs and expand health coverage.big trend or not, practicing medicine without insurance has strong appeal for some doctors."collecting money from third-party payers has become very complex and expensive," said james e. allen, a kansas city internal-medicine doctor. "if i could find an adequate clientele that could pay for visits as we went, then i'd probably drop a lot of the insurers i'm with."source: http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/3813864.html

	 payday loans bill could be big win for consumer activists
	 
    


salem, ore. (ap) — after pushing unsuccessfully for years for tougher restrictions on short-term "payday" loans, consumer activists are on the brink of winning a victory in this week's special session of the oregon legislature.oregon now is only one of seven states with no interest cap on payday loans, but legislators this week are expected to pass a new state law limiting interest to 36 percent a year and enacting other consumer protections for borrowers of payday loans.the special session, set to begin thursday, initially was called by gov. ted kulongoski to funnel more state aid to struggling school districts and to plug a $136 million budget hole in oregon's health and human services programs.however, house and senate leaders decided there was enough bipartisan support surrounding the payday loans issue to add it to the agenda for this week's special session.the payday loan industry has been growing rapidly in oregon to satisfy the public's demand for short-term loans. but consumer advocates say a new state law is needed to protect people from lenders who at times charge more than 500 percent interest.the last time the legislature met, in the regular 2005 session, a bill to limit interest rates on payday loans was approved by the democrat-controlled senate but died in the republican-controlled house.that measure was shelved by a house committee chairman who was angry about insinuations by a campaign finance watchdog group that house speaker karen minnis and other gop lawmakers had been bought off with campaign contributions from the payday loan industry.the payday loan dispute has become an issue in minnis's re-election campaign, with her democratic challenger for the seat, rob brading, championing payday reform in the house speaker's east multnomah county district.a spokesman for minnis on tuesday played down the re-election issue and said minnis has cleared the way for a bill to pass in the special session because some places, such as portland and gresham, are moving to pass local ordinances clamping down on payday loans."she feels it would be better to enact strong consumer protections on a consistent, statewide basis," spokesman chuck deister said.whatever the reason, a leading backer of payday loan reform applauded minnis' "welcome change of heart" on the issue."we're delighted that the legislature is serious about passing a real payday loan reform law," said patty wentz of the our oregon coalition.the coalition had planned to join with community activists, union leaders and church groups to work for passage of a ballot measure this fall to clamp a limit on interest rates charged for payday loans.that campaign will be put on hold if the legislature passes the payday loans bill this week, wentz said."it will save us hundreds of thousands of dollars, and thousands of volunteer hours" that otherwise would have been devoted to ballot measure campaign, she said.source: http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-14/1145405650196260.xml&storylist=orlocal

	 credit card system could cause confusion
	 
    


a $50 gas purchase at the pumps could tie up more than $150 worth of credit card space for days following the fill-up.a pre-authorized payment system used by fuel stations allows credit card companies to put a hold of more than $100 on a card's available funds, on top of the cost of the gas.by not disclosing this practice, retailers and credit card companies are violating consumers' rights, said consumers' council of canada president joan huzar."if you don't know that this kind of thing is going on, then you could think you're putting a $40 charge on your card and it's not really that at all, it's $100," she said. "and that could leave you in a very embarrassing situation."by warning consumers, businesses give them the opportunity to go inside to pay or decide whether to use their credit card or another method of payment, huzar said.some motorists filling up on regina's east side friday were unaware of the pre-authorized hold."i'm a bit surprised," said one man while waiting for his tank to fill."it's just like when you go to a hotel," added a woman, who was unfazed by the news.indeed, hotels and rental car companies do follow a similar pre-authorized system of credit card payment.ted stoner, a spokesperson for the canadian petroleum products institute, said the same method is used for all three services when something is purchased on credit without an exact cost determined before a credit card is swiped.the contract is between credit card companies and retailers, he added."they require some sort of a liability be set up or be established against the credit card until the actual final amount is determined," stoner said.he didn't know what the major integrated petroleum companies that are members of the cppi do to inform customers about the pre-authorized payment system. whatever measures the companies take would be consistent across the country, he added.but jesse taylor, a toronto resident gassing up in regina on his way to calgary, said he was aware of the hold put on his credit card when he charges gas at the pump. in ontario, taylor said, customers are informed by a screen on the pump that if they know they are going to spend less than $75 to $100 on gas, they'll have to punch in the specific amount they want, or face a hold on their credit card plus the cost of the gas."it's a little bit better i guess, especially because they don't tell you here," he said. "i can see how it would be a pain for some people if they spend more than they actually wanted to."stoner, who said he will have to go look at the pump to confirm whether or not there is a warning about a hold on credit cards, said there aren't any plans to change the current system. if there is enough public demand, he said putting a notice on the pump would be seriously considered."this is something that's been around for eight to 10 years. i'm surprised it's coming up now," he said.source: http://www.canada.com

	 irs worker accused of credit card fraud
	 
    


dallas - an internal revenue service employee was arrested thursday and accused of stealing another person's social security and credit card numbers for a shopping spree, officials said.authorities arrested john sebastian king, 43, at work at the dallas office of the irs after a federal indictment earlier this week charging him with 12 counts of fraud.the indictment alleges that king used someone else's social security number to obtain the person's credit card numbers. king, an irving resident, used the card numbers to buy luggage, furniture, tires and other items, according to the indictment.a spokeswoman for the u.s. attorney's office declined to specify king's job or whether he had used his post to obtain the social security number.a call to king's public defender was not returned thursday. if convicted on all counts, king faces up to 90 years in prison and a $3 million fine.king has been released on bond with his arraignment set for april 14.source: http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/3777639.html

	 lack of credit card knowledge, could cost you
	 
    


how much do you know about your credit cards? apparently not very much, according to a new survey.a lack of credit card knowledge could affect you in more ways than you think.credit card knowledgeyour credit is important. it affects your ability to buy just about anything, from a new pair of shoes to a new home.but, do you really understand the fine print in your credit card agreements?  "every credit card offer has a schumer box, which lists key information about that offer, such as the apr, or the annual percentage rate, as well as what happens if say you're late in making a payment on that card," explains personal finance expert lynnette khalfani. however, according to a new survey, 44-percent of respondents' say they don't know the apr charged on their cards, while 20-percent don't know what their credit limit is.the findings suggest that some problems could begin with credit offers received in the mail."credit card offers with really tiny fine print or hard-to-find disclosures can be confusing for consumers," says khalfani. "the schumer box is a valuable consumer resource, but i still think that a lot more can be done within the industry to make credit card disclosures a lot easier for consumers to understand."for example, your card may have a universal default clause, which means if you're late paying on one card, your rate on another card could go up, sometimes significantly. "don't accept a credit card based solely on the interest rate that you're being offered. you really need to shop around and compare overall terms," says khalfani.shred it!if you get a credit card offer in the mail, you don't want, be sure to shred it as well.source: http://www.wndu.com/news/contact16/042006/contact16_49124.php
