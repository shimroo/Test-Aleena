9-11 research


an attempt to uncover the truth about september 11th, 2001





we all know the official story of september 11th:
four jetliners
were hijacked by groups of four and five arabic men armed with box cutters,
who proceeded to fly three of the four jets into the
twin towers
and the
pentagon.
subsequently the world trade center towers,
weakened by the impacts and fires,
collapsed into piles of rubble.

the fbi had compiled a list of hijackers within three days,
and it was so obvious that osama bin laden had masterminded the
operation from caves in afghanistan, that there was no need
to seriously investigate the crime or produce evidence.
the "retaliatory" attack on the taliban would soon commence.


is this story true?
its central assumptions have never been tested by an official government body
whose members lack obvious conflicts of interest.
there are numerous
red flags
in the official story,
which requires a long series of
highly improbable coincidences.
questioning that story
is an act of responsible citizenship.







9-11research
  provides factual, reasoned analysis
  
  of the 9/11 attack
  


  * documenting evidence of the crime

thermitic pyrotechnics in the wtc made simple:
  three points of
  active thermitic material discovered
  in dust from the 9/11 world trade center catastrophe
  
  that anyone can understand
  
  - a concise non-technical summary of three key points
  about recently documented unexploded pyrotechnics from the twin towers
  

explosives found in world trade center dust:
  scientists discover both residues and unignited fragments
  of high-tech metal incendiaries in debris from the twin towers
  
  - a non-technical guide to the newly published paper
  explaining the identification of nano-engineered explosive materials 
  in dust from the twin towers
  


  * exposing fallacies of the official reports

building a better mirage:
  nist's 3-year $20,000,000 cover-up
  of the crime of the century
  
  - nist's report evades the very question it purported to investigate:
  what caused the total destruction of
  the world trade center's twin towers?
  



  * examining flawed theories presented as 9/11 truth
  

google earth exposes pentagon flyover farce, or,
   critiquing pentacon (smoking crack version)
  - showing the absurdity of the pentacon's premise
  

the pentagon attack: what the physical evidence shows
  
  - exposing errors underpinning the "no-jetliner" theories
  

sifting through loose change: volume 2: the pentagon
  - critiqing the popular but error-ridden film loose change











    9-11 research focuses on the facts of the attack
    and analysis of the official explanation.

disclaimer


    9-11 research does not promote
    incivility,
    junk science,
    or 'no-jetliner' claims.
    








9-11 research is an investigation and analysis
of the events of september 11, 2001.
it archives physical evidence of the crimes,
such as photographs and videos,
provides referenced reports of events relating to the crime,
and offers detailed analysis of theories of the attack,
especially those advanced by the official fema and nist investigations.


widely recognized for the quality of work it presents,
9-11 research has been deceptively portrayed by media icons such as
scientific american
and popular mechanics
as promoting the very methods and ideas it works to expose
as smokescreens to genuine investigation of the crimes of 9/11/01.
