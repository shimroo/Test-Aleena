celebrate by givingbe the light this holiday season. for 24 years we have believed in the light and tried to be the light for families with children facing, and undergoing, treatment for a catastrophic health/injury diagnosis. when my son was diagnosed with cancer it was on december 13. sitting in the hospital in shock, praying desperately for a miracle, missing my other three children, torn because it was the holidays and that was the last thing i could focus on for my family, always resurfaces during december.i also remember sitting in the lobby of the hospital with my little one and looking around at all of the children sick, weary, yet smiling, listening to the christmas music of a local choir and i wondered, "why my child?" i will never have the answer to that question, but my answer to others is to make sure that each and every day, whether a holiday or not, a family can be together, focused on their child, during their treatment and hopeful recovery. especially during the holidays. let your heart be a light for families in need and give them a chance to once again believe in the light.believe in the light, be the light.

oh what luck - you found a duck!



patches of light assists families across the us and beyond. we are trying to get our mission out to the areas we assist and need your help. if you are heading out of town and would like to "deliver" some ducks to areas we assist, please let us know! it's as easy as placing a rubber ducky on the postcard we already have made up and dropping into a "pond." our ponds are the areas we help in and need to get our name out to those communities for their support. i would love to pack a bag and cruise into all of the areas we help in to share our mission, but in reality our little ducks would be a better option. if you are traveling and would like to be a part of our patches cruising ducks please let me know and i will get a "pond package," ready to go. if you already live in an area we help in i will also be happy to send you some to pass out in your own community. thank you!as mother teresa once said, "“i alone cannot change the world, but i can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.”

sibling support surveynearly a quarter-million children are siblings to children living with serious illness. a variety of physical, emotional, social and psychological concerns are presented when a brother or sister is diagnosed with a serious illness or disease. support services for siblings are critical to promote positive outcomes and decrease negative consequences and align with parents’ desires to support all of their children. these include services offered to the sibling or family to provide comfort or enhance the quality of life during a child’s serious illness. despite national standards, sibling support services are often difficult for families to access. the aim of this survey is to determine the availability of support services for siblings and the path to which a family can access these support services.
