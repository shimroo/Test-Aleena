the center for process studies fosters interdisciplinary research and education to cultivate holistic understanding for human and planetary flourishing 










						"if we want a society in which the sense of belonging is strong, people are concerned for one another, and there is strong commitment to the common good, we need a metaphysics that shows that we are in fact part of larger societies and have no existence apart from our relations to others"					


john b. cobb, jr. 






						"philosophy begins in wonder. and, at the end, when philosophic thought has done its best, the wonder remains."					


alfred north whitehead
