since 1991cultivating characteraround the world









 


“the mission of the virtues project is to inspire people of all cultures to remember who we really are and to live by our highest values.”




the virtues project is a global initiative, inspiring the practice of virtues in everyday life. its foundation is research into the world’s great wisdom traditions. the purpose of its programs, books, and materials is to make this timeless knowledge accessible in our individual and collective lives.the five strategies of the virtues project are tools for personal growth and healing, and a path to deeper meaning, purpose and joy in our lives. the project has helped generations of parents to raise children of compassion and integrity, and educators to integrate authentic self-esteem and moral excellence into teaching, schools to create a culture of caring, safety, and excellence and leaders to encourage excellence, trustworthiness and generosity in the workplace and the community.the five strategies of the virtues project initially provided a way to support parents, and it quickly became clear that it was having a transformational effect on them personally. it has had a life of its own, leading to universal application in programs for personal healing, character education, compassionate end of life, community development and more.since 1991 the virtues project has been introduced in more than 135 countries by our trained facilitators and virtues enthusiasts. it has inspired and mobilized people worldwide to commit acts of humanity and service, to heal violence with virtues, and to lead with character.the virtues project is being implemented within prevention, intervention and healing programs worldwide.
