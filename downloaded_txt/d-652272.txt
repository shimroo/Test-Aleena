welcome to the ladb






 announcement: 
please see the board’s order concerning the ladb office closure from january 21-24, 2025 due to inclement weather and the related filing extension  here.

in 1990, the supreme court of louisiana established the louisiana attorney disciplinary board, a statewide agency to administer the lawyer discipline and disability system. members of the louisiana attorney disciplinary board are appointed by the court. both lawyers and non-lawyer citizens are appointed to serve on the board. board members volunteer their time in service of the mission of the board.

                        the primary purpose of the discipline and disability system is to protect the public. to accomplish this purpose, the agency investigates complaints of lawyer ethical misconduct and makes recommendations to the louisiana supreme court when discipline is warranted.
