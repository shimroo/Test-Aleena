national honor a representation of peters townshipâs commitment to golf
february 3, 2025by josh rowntree, director of communications

scholarship fund
founded in 1941, nearly 700 students have received a scholarship.


the wpga scholarship fund was founded in 1941 and awarded two scholarships to the university of pittsburgh and another to duquesne university. the first caddie welfare committee surfaced in 1927 and addressed issues to benefit of caddies at the various member clubs of the association. fourteen years later the movement secured enough money to sponsor its first scholars.
