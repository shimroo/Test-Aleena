i have always liked this site because of their
        dedication to the mac platform. having really good knowledgable people, and reasonable prices helps a lot too.
        this is where i want to do business when i need something for my mac.
jeffrey t.






as with all my past business at owc this experience
        was no different, outstanding! always the go to guys for anything mac. and their service after the sale is first
        class in my opinion.

for all computerkind™

our story starts with a kid in barn who dared to dream big in rural illinois. for others, their
            path
            of when they pushed beyond expectations may begin differently, but many of these stories share one thing in
            common — “computing.” computing levels the playing field. it makes what was once only capable by those with
            means, available for everyone. computing shatters the barriers of what’s possible. so we can all be
            empowered to
            dream big.
here’s to you, and for all computerkind.
