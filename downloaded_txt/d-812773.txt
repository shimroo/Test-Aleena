north atlantic scuba is one of the largest and most experienced dive centers in new england. since 1979, we have had the privilege of assisting tens of thousands of people in discovering the wonder of what's down under, near and far. we have spent lots of time underwater and are looking forward to blowing lots more bubbles: let's go diving together! it's time for you to make it happen!
