 the 2nd edition of oceans of kansas - a natural history of the western interior sea will be published in september, 2017. the updated book will be larger, with more figures, descriptions of new discoveries in the past 12 years, and an in depth look at the history of late cretaceous paleontology in kansas. i'm very pleased that the indiana university press has given me the opportunity to bring oceans of kansas up to date. 
important note: as
mentioned above, this website is now over twenty years old, older than some of
its readers. unfortunately, html technology changes rapidly and my old microsoft
frontpage html editor is no longer supported. worse yet, my two hundred plus
web pages cannot be easily translated into a new text editor, and i am too old
to start it over - not to mention that my cool digital photos from the early
years are not so cool anymore. so the bottom line is that oceans of kansas
cannot be updated easily, and will eventually fade from the internet. it has
been a wonderful 20 years.





welcome to the  oceans of
    kansas paleontology  web page.   my name is mike everhart and i am your
    host on a virtual journey more than 85 million years "back in time" to
    observe some of the many strange and wonderful creatures that lived in the oceans of the
    earth during the final stages of the age of dinosaurs.  i have collected
    fossils from the smoky hill chalk of western kansas for the last thirty-plus years and
    have been an adjunct curator of paleontology at the sternberg museum of natural history in hays, kansas    since 1998. i was twice president (2005 and 2015) of the kansas
    academy of science, and have served as a co-editor of the transactions of the
    kansas academy of science from 2006 through the present (2017). currently my wife and i are managing editors of the transactions. the tkas is one of the oldest science journals in the united states
    (est. 1872). 
i have conducted a paleontology
    symposium at the past eighteen annual meetings (2000-2017) of the kansas academy of science (abstracts of the
      12th paleo-symposium (2011) here), and the second mosasaur meeting in may, 2007 (below).
note that most of the information available on this website is published my 2005 book, oceans of kansas - a natural history of the western interior sea. 
(left) the 2nd edition of oceans of kansas is due to be published by the indiana university press in september, 2017. the 2nd edition is extensively updated and 25% larger than the first edition, with more photos of fossils... and mostly in color.
indiana university press says, "oceans of kansas remains the best and only available book of its type currently available."
i am also the author of sea monsters - prehistoric creatures of the deep, published by national geographic in 2008. the national geographic imax movie, sea monsters, is available on dvd and blu-ray.

dinosaurs
      in kansas?
 although, with one known exception, dinosaurs did not live in kansas, some of them died
      and floated into the western interior sea over kansas.

there are also many links to other excellent
    paleo web pages and museum sites around the world, so please plan on taking some time
    to see what is available. also, don't forget to bookmark this page so that you can come
    back occasionally to see what has been added. the two best ways to 'surf' the oceans of
    kansas site are to use the table of contents pages, or the links to this site and other paleontology web pages. there are also
    'hyper-links' embedded in the text on most of the pages that will take you to other
    sub-pages for more information on that subject. these links are highlighted in a different
    color (light blue) and are 'click-able'.   from the links    page, you can surf the net to sites all over the world, but please take a tour of oceans
    of kansas paleontology first. to get things started, let's take a look at:

kansas geological survey.

with pls.  





the cretaceous period lasted
    from about 144 million years ago to 65 million years ago.   in kansas, it is
    represented by marine and estuarine deposits from the early cretaceous  (albian)
    cheyenne sandstone and kiowa shale that overlay the wellington formation  (permian)
    or the morrison formation (jurassic) at the base, to the pierre shale at the top. (see kansas geology map and time scale).  
    a brief cretaceous time scale is found here. the 1999 version
    of the gsa (geological society of america)
    geologic time scale is found here    as a printable .pdf file (233 kb).
a major part of the upper portion
    (late cretaceous) of these deposits is referred to as the niobrara formation.  it
    contains a rather unique member called the smoky hill chalk, and provides the exposures
    for two kansas landmarks: castle rock and monument rocks. the chalk found in kansas was deposited
    between 87 and 82 million years ago during a period when a shallow inland sea (the western
    interior sea) covered most of the midwest from the gulf of mexico to the arctic
    circle.  the deposition of these chalky, marine sediments occurred during the last
    half of the cretaceous period, approximately 15-20 million years before the end of the age
    of dinosaurs.    
the smoky hill chalk member is about 600 feet thick in kansas, and lies
    conformably above the fort hays limestone, and below the pierre shale. for the most part,
    the chalk is composed of the compacted shells (coccolithophores) and plates
    (coccoliths) of an abundant, microscopic, golden-brown algae (chrysophyceae) that
    lived in the clear waters of a warm, shallow sea. a large percentage of the chalk is 
    made up of coprolites containing coccoliths from the animals that fed on the
    algae.

    photos of the smoky hill chalk here. 


 




a generalized map of the north american continent during late
    cretaceous time. the western interior sea covered most of the midwest from the present
    gulf of mexico to the arctic. (map modified from an exhibit at the university of nebraska state museum)


 
the
western interior sea,sometimes called the inland sea, was probably less than 600 feet deep in most areas, and
had a relatively flat and soft, mud bottom. it is considered to be an 'epi-continental
sea'; that is, one which lies on top of a continental landmass, and not between
continents.   near the middle of the sea where kansas is now located, sediments were
deposited at a rate which would ultimately produce about one inch of compacted chalk for
every 700 years. the chalk also has more than a hundred thin layers of bentonite clay,
most of which are rusty red in color, that are the result of the fall of ash from repeated
eruptions of volcanoes to the west of kansas in what is now nevada and utah. these ash
deposits can be traced for miles across the chalk beds and have been used as marker units
in describing the stratigraphy of the formation (see hattin, 1982). in addition, several
species of vertebrate and invertebrate marine life that lived and/or became extinct at
certain times during the deposition of the chalk are useful in determining the age and
biostratigraphy of widely separated exposures (see stewart, 1990). near the end of the
cretaceous, the western interior sea began to close, becoming shallower and narrower as
the rocky mountains were pushed up from the west, uplifting the sea bottom as they
rose.  eventually, the center of north america rose above sea level and the sediments
(limestones, sandstones, shales and chalk) deposited on the basement rocks of kansas for
nearly half a billion years began to erode away.  





a map of kansas showing the surface and sub-surface
    distribution of the remaining cretaceous rocks (adapted from the kansas geological survey
    bulletin 162; 1963).  although kansas was once nearly covered with cretaceous marine
    deposits, millions of  years of erosion have removed a
    large portion of them them from the surface, leaving many areas of chalk exposed along river valleys in the northwest portion of
    the state. go here for more information on kansas geology.

    fossils -  kansas geological survey  
 


 

this shallow ocean was home to a variety of marine animals, almost all of
which are now extinct. these included giant clams, rudists,
crinoids, squid, ammonites, numerous sharks and bony fish,turtles, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs , pteranodons and even several species of marine (toothed)
birds. although it seems unlikely that you would find dinosaur fossils in the middle
of the western interior sea, a number of them (a hadrosaur
found by o. c. marsh in 1871, and several nodosaurs, includingthe type specimen of niobrarasaurus coleii) have been collected from the
smoky hill chalk, and their remains have been well documented. the bodies of these
dinosaurs must have somehow floated hundreds of miles into the sea before sinking to the
bottom or being torn apart by scavenging sharks. it is possible that they died during
catastrophic flooding on the land masses to the east or west, and were carried out to sea
on a large, tangled mat of trees and other vegetation (fossilized wood, including large
logs, is also known from the chalk).
over a period of about five million of years, the remains of many of these
animals were preserved as fossils in the soft, chalky mud of the sea bottom. when this mud
was compressed under thousands of feet overlying shale, it became a deposit of chalk that
is more than 600 feet thick in western kansas. most of the massive chalk formation that
once covered kansas, however, has been eroded away over the last 60 million years and is
now exposed only in a relatively small area in the northwestern corner of the state. this
part of kansas is also known as the smoky
hills.
since 1868 and the discovery of tylosaurus
proriger, the smoky hill chalk has been the source of thousands of fossil
specimens, many of which are on exhibit today in museums around the world. the first
significant collections of kansas fossils were made by relatively unknown scientists like professor benjamin f. mudge, dr. george m.
sternberg, dr. john janeway, and dr. theophilus h. turner. 
many others  were collected by and for such famous paleontologists as edward drinker cope, o. c. marsh, samuel w. williston, and charles sternberg, (for more information on the sternberg
family, click here), 
including a large portion of the yale peabody museum collection that resulted from the yale college scientific
expeditions of the 1870s. for some 'old time' advice on collecting fossils, see an 1884 article by charles h. sternberg here. much of the
early work on mosasaurs in kansas was published in the university
geological survey of kansas in the late 1890's.  a large number have been found
since then by amateur collectors and many of these have been significant additions to
paleontology.  the sternberg museum of
natural history at fort hays state university,  the museum of natural history at the university of kansas,
and the university of nebraska state museum have excellent
collections of fossils from the smoky hill chalk. the
denver museum of nature and science, the sam noble
museum of natural history in norman, oklahoma, the field museum of
natural history in chicago, the philadelphia
academy of natural sciences, and the american museum of
natural history also have many kansas fossils.  click here for additional
information about some early american paleontologists.
