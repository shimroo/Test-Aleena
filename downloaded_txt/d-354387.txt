testimonials 









my favorite place for pastries! this german pastry shoppe is a staple in the arlington area. i have ordered the meats, cheeses, lattes, cakes, cookies, oversized german pretzels, and plenty more! the pastries are not overly sweet and are so beautifully decorated.

everything here is delicious! their german chocolate cake is amazing! they also have amazing bratwurst and cookies. if it's a nice day out, you can enjoy your food on one of their picnic tables.
